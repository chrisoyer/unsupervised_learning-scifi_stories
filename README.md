# Unsupervised Learning: Feature extraction and clustering with NLP on texts to facilitate classification.
For this project, I scraped a number of fictional short stories from Tor.com, a publisher of speculative fiction. I used several natural language processing techniques to extract features, and used several clustering algorithms to group similar stories. These were added to the td\*idf vector features and used for classification modeling.
