Now Ezo, a revolutionary soldier for twenty years, is gone. She came today to plead with my parents to leave. “The battle is coming this way,” she said. But they had heard this before.

Azul shrieks “Dapîra!” as our grandmother’s red shawl floats from the inferno, crisping to ash.', 'She was still in the house.', 'I grab him and stumble through the ruined courtyard wall.

Any second now, we might be devoured by a ravening SI with intentions we cannot begin to fathom.', 'I say ', ' because, you know: nuclear weapons, nanotech gray goo, biological warfare—all of which could be SI tools if the initial algorithm on which their self-learning depends decides these methods would further their goals. The standard model is that SIs, presently isolated from the Internet, learn like children, through self-directed assimilation. Developers are gambling they’ll grow up much wiser than us. Given their source material, I find that hope misbegotten. They might choose to love us, but why?', 'And could their imagined trajectories be any worse than our increasing totalitarianism? Or any worse than one of the main hallmarks of what it means to be human, which is to kill our fellows, or even send our own kin to torture or death if a certain “belief”—whatever a belief might be, neurochemically speaking—has taken up residence in our unfathomable brains?', 'Bring it on, I say. The change might be for the better.', 'Zoe’s dream is to distill a master algorithm for beneficence.', 'And I once tried to levitate the Pentagon.', 'My Metro stop is across the street from the Freer Gallery, where after leaving a long career, I’m living my lifetime dream of being a Chinese philosopher-painter in the Song Dynasty’s bureaucracy.

They said, ', 'True. A sixty-hour work week was nothing; I would fly to Cape Town, Khartoum, or Bogotá on a day’s notice. I oversaw development of methods of teaching reading based on what we were learning from fMRI technologies about how children really learn, assembled teams of international experts, and ably wielded the double-edged sword of statistical analysis, but I was burned out. Increasingly, the work we had done was deliberately dismantled, failing those who had put their trust in us. The magnitude of their need overwhelmed me. It was time for those I had mentored to take center stage. I often lunch with them, and they are doing splendid work.', 'At the Freer I’m in charge of nothing more consequential than deciding where to lunch.', 'After Ed died, Zoe urged me to move to California. But I’ve always lived in the D.C. area, in what Dad called “my little row house” in a subdivision right off the Beltway, where I grew up. Ed and I moved in with my parents after the one of the crashes, thinking it temporary, then never wanted to take the kids away from school, friends, and grandparents. Wonderful years passed and the memory-steeped neighborhood, with friends whose parents I knew, is my lodestone. Even my grandfather, born in the nineteenth century, lived there after Grandma died.', 'At first, he was angry.', '“The twins fight too much,” I remember Grandpa saying to Mom as we squabbled one summer morning after Dad left for work. The culprits were me and my brother Wayne.', 'Grandpa was finishing up the breakfast dishes, scrubbing the copper-bottomed Revere Ware using his famous “elbow grease,” which Wayne and I had decidedly not inherited.

It’s on the kitchen windowsill with the night-blooming cereus, which is almost as old as the house. Dad talked to the graceful, twining cereus each year on the single summer night it bloomed, releasing its heady fragrance. “Well, hello,” he’d say gently, alone in the kitchen, before announcing its annual amazement to the rest of us as if it were a newborn child.', 'I take the potion about as often as my still-thriving cereus blooms. Anything remotely useful has long expired, but I love that Zoe sent it to me, along with instructions to eat only lettuce.', 'What’s the point?', 'As I enter the spacious hush of the Freer and pass Whistler’s Peacock Room, I realize that I don’t even remember the walk from the Metro. Maybe tomorrow I should read the funnies first.', '\\xa0', 'I’ve never been courageous. I was coddled, kept away from politics, and expected to do well. My math skills got me a scholarship in London, much good it will do me now. That future remains in a negative infinity as I move ever-farther from my locus.', 'We named our bus ', ', Friend.

It quickly learned our songs and taught us new ones—essential for the four thousand or so kilometers we traveled.

I fear all of us are deeply scarred. How could it be otherwise?', 'There is no one to see into me, as Dapîra could, but if she were here, she would find me hunched in the corner of a place that no longer exists, falling through space, not concerned that I may someday hit the ground.', 'And here we are, staggering from that wretched truck. Where? We don’t know. It’s about thirty arid hectares with a gully on one side and a few scrubby trees on the other, but it has a well, a food truck, and maybe a hundred other kids. We storm the food truck and drink gallons of water. The sun is hot. We find a concrete pad next to an antique petrol pump and shelter beneath its tin roof. I sleep, and sleep, and sleep. It is heaven to not be moving.', '\\xa0', '“MEDA recommends a tweak in your serotonin uptake,” Nan, the nurse practitioner, says. “You’re a little bit out of balance.”', 'Nan and I have known each other for years. “‘Out of balance’ sounds decidedly unscientific.

Better than digital, I’m certain, even if that endless golden field is actually some flowering weeds on a rubble-filled lot. I have biologically sourced emotions, splendid ones, rather than the dry, digital approximation Zoe thinks we might choose in her glowing beneficent future, and right now they seem worth the admission price of eventual death.', 'On the way back to work, I buy a yoga mat at a trance-inducing shop I escape by sheer will, then help unpack a long-awaited painting by Zhou Jichang at the Freer. After a thousand years, the vermilion of the monk’s robe is still astoundingly vivid.', 'At 5:30, I am not seething, as I traipse down the long-broken Metro escalator, about how the best of our intentions and vision for a more fair and inclusive future, with public transportation for all, inspires the callous among us to break out the ever-sharp tools of passivity and neglect. I’m not exactly adrift in joy, but everything is a tad, just a tad, more tolerable.', 'As we rumble through the freight yards of Alexandria, though, a glimpse of a rusty, cinnabar-orange freight car ignites a memory of Jichang’s single, extraordinarily pure red-orange brushstroke, which floods me in visceral, electrifying amazement, a sounding tone that infuses car and fellow passengers, then expands in a swift, brief, inexplicable flash that encompasses far stars and the precise arrangement of particles that we call, briefly, ourselves. I want to jump up and shout, “Look! See!” but retain enough sense to realize that doing so might lead to a strip search in a grimy Alexandria police station, an embarrassing call to my lawyer, and a delay in dinner.', 'So I simply surrender to what might be called wonder, if one were even slightly optimistic.

But why there?” She looks sideways; I hear her tap computer keys. “Okay, it looks like—yeah. A refugee camp of mostly children.”', '“All kinds of child refugees. War, climate, you name it.”', '“Your specialty.” Her frown relaxes; her voice has lost its manic edge.', '“There are actually a lot of these camps. More every month. I started hearing about them a few weeks ago.”', '“What do you mean, hearing about them?”', '“My phone suggested it.”', '“Hmm. And you weren’t disturbed?”', 'At first, I was.', '\\xa0', 'I hoped it was Azul, the laughing boy, calling that evening in the kitchen. \\xa0Instead, I saw an inscrutable ', '.', '“Who is this?”', '1/0 showed me a schematic of lines throughout the Middle East and Africa converging in the rough center, with dots forging new paths as I watched. One dot enlarged, showing Azul pounding on the window of a bus and screaming. An older girl held him on her lap and rocked him.', 'Next, it showed me a vast, well-organized refugee camp filled with mostly children, sharing tales of horrific violence.', 'Then, a swift statistical analysis of online CVs paused on mine, moved swiftly to the MEDA portal (which offered no resistance), and displayed CT scans in psychedelic colors enlarging and shrinking with hallucinatory speed.', 'Shadowy images emerged, focused, and intensified. Brisk spring wind filled the air with flowers. A cherry blossom alighted on the golden brim of my grandfather’s boater. I felt again, as fresh-smelling rain pattered outside the open kitchen window, that sweet burst of emotion so strong that my chest ached, and tears came to my eyes.', 'A woman’s voice said, “I can show you the neurochemistry of how I access these memories.

Are you okay?” asks Zoe, startling me back to the airport.', '“Oh! Yes, yes. Actually, since you were here, I’ve been reading a lot of literature about AI and superintelligence, including your work.”', 'She laughs. “Good! I’m always here to interpret.” Her eyes widen. “Okay, I’ve found Team Ezo’s website, a video channel—all kinds of social media. They’re developing a mission based on the UN’s Declaration of the Rights of the Child to health, education, freedom from want, and freedom from war. Hmm. Water rights—domestic violence—access to medical technology—it’s going to be quite political.

How can code, however sophisticated, know the fear of the different, the relief of the same, or the tension that sparks movement?', 'Zoe’s fellows describe SI as an infant with frightening power. But Ezo has no eye with which to aim a hand at a bauble; no hand at all, no way to build neural pathways. It has no limbic system, and no amygdalae. There can be no love, no fear, no joy, without a body. Our hands, not code, create a self, which is not just in our heads, our brains, but distributed throughout our bodies.', 'Human minds are firmly grounded in what we learn through our senses, and we rewrite ourselves from day one, paring and learning constantly, through intense stages of neuroplasticity. Though Ezo can rewrite its own code, the child analogy stops there. A toddler can identify a cube without sight, by touch. She learns how a color can be deep delight, has fingers that recoil at heat, knows that a certain face means joy, or fear. Pathways we call anguish and love emerge from our unique physicality.', 'We and Ezo are alien to one another. Without a human body, how can Ezo understand beneficence, or the impact of the choices it might make on our behalf? With its very name, 1/0 lays claim to being different, to being irrational, when our concept of AI has been one of an exact, digital, emotionless, and inexorable entity that can never understand what it means to us when it wins at playing our game, whether that game be chess or the project of moving humanity farther from war, closer to a just society and a sustainable, flourishing world.', 'I truly hope Ezo is something utterly new.', 'Despite eons of moral musings, we have not yet discovered what we are.

That would be bad—it’s part of Aunt Augustine’s set and Lily would cry if any of them broke. Carefully, I lay it down on the counter next to the sink. Leaning forward, I submerge my hands into the soapy water. The warm water feels so good. I can almost feel my blood flowing in my veins, I think, and I flex my fingers. No trembling. Good.', '“Mom?” Lily takes a step behind me. “Are you okay?”', '“I’m fine, sweetheart.” I turn around and wipe my hands on my jeans. “Fast or slow? Is there time to find your father?”', '“Slow,” Lily says. “Very slow. And Dad knows. He’s in the garden.” She ducks her head and stares at me from beneath a frizzy halo of ash-brown curls, looking very much like her father’s child. “He wants you to come.”', '“Of course, he does.” I sigh. Damn Dash. I would have come—I will still come—but he has to keep flinging himself against this and it’s going to break his heart. I’m not going to change.', 'Lily hears my sigh. She echoes it in that exaggerated way kids mimic adults, thrusting out her lower lip, and huffing until the curls around her face tremble.', '“Come on, Moooom,” she says and pulls at my hand.', 'She tows me out of the cool darkness of the house and into the green wilderness of the garden. We head southeast towards the river that marks the boundary. I keep my pace deliberate, slow, dignified, despite Lily’s impatient tugs.', '“The butterflies are so pretty,” Lily tells me. “They’re blue and big, almost the size of my hand. Like this!” She pulls from my grasp and cups her hands together to demonstrate.', 'The path to the river comes out behind an overgrown hedge and leads us down a slight slope. As we skirt a willow tree, the river comes into view. I see Dash standing stock-still on the path ahead, one arm clasped across his chest, the other hand propping his chin. He has not yet noticed Lily or me come up behind him, being transfixed by the scene before us.', 'The river is a small one, shallow, gentle, hardly deserving of the name—a tributary branch leading to a larger one. A low rocky embankment leads up the slope towards us, and perched on the largest of those rocks is a withered and naked woman…if you can call the husk before us a woman at all.', 'Faded blue gingham pools around her feet, and her legs rise like scrawny white aspens above the crumpled fabric. Her arms are open wide, as if to embrace the sun, and her white-gray hair unspools into the morning breeze. A cloud of blue butterflies eddies on this same breeze, shifting around her, exposing and then hiding and exposing again her collapsed breasts, her sagging buttocks, her scarred belly. As I watch, I see dark spores blossom on her skin. One here, one there. They swell slowly into gold-green pods—chrysalides, really, which ripen and split. The butterflies crawl backwards into this life, unfurling crumpled, wet wings. The outer edge of the wing resembles split wood with whorled knots, but each butterfly unfolds itself into a slice of fluttering blue sky and dark stormshadow. Open—sky, closed—wood. Each insect delicately buds. Each one just as delicately extends a proboscis to taste the salt on Gray-Granna’s skin, and then casts itself into the butterfly-cloud.', 'She is already shriveling, her mass dropping away in featherscale weights.', 'Lily pulls her hand from mine and sidles down the rocky slope towards Gray-Granna. “I’ve brought them,” she announces.', 'I doubt that Gray-Granna hears Lily. I can no longer see visible ears. The face itself is masked by a hundred opening-and-closing wings. The thin hands that once stroked my daughter’s hair reach sunwards, like starveling branches attenuated in a drought. The breasts are all but gone now.', 'Lily doesn’t seem to notice this ruin. She only sees butterflies. Beautiful blue butterflies. She reaches a hand towards the cloud and Dash reflexively clamps his hand on her shoulder, pulling her up short.', '“Not now, kiddo,” he says, the gentleness in his voice belying the urgent grip. “Leave her be.”', '“I want to touch her,” Lily says. “Before she finishes dying. I want to touch them.”', 'I find my voice. “Honey, they’re new butterflies. You could hurt them.”', 'Both Dash and Lily turn and give me identical surprised looks. “Not Gray-Granna’s butterflies,” Lily says patiently. ', 'Dash converts his surprise into a warm smile for me. “I’m glad you’re here, Viv. She’s glad you’re here too.” He nods at his grandmother.', ', I think bitterly, unfairly. Unfair to Dash anyway, who means well, damn him.', '“I should get your parents,” I say. “Your father will want to know. Maybe your cousins—”', 'Dash’s eyes focus on something beyond me. “They know.”', 'Of course. The family always knows.', 'Dash’s father arrives next, slogging over wet stones, from upstream. Swaddled in ugly green waders, he has slung a creel over one shoulder and wields an expensive rod as if it were a sword. He hitches his head towards his mother as he passes her, and asks, “How long?”', '“Thirty-two minutes.” Lily brandishes a Hello Kitty stopwatch. “Slow.”', '“Damn fool woman,” Dash’s father says. “Took the only spot I can get a reasonable cast off. Too shallow on the shore.”', 'Dash rolls his eyes.', 'Dash’s mother makes her way down the path only a few minutes later. Like her husband, she’s armed and ready for a deathwatch. Her weapons of choice are knitting needles. She picks her way daintily down the path, and finds a half-rotted log for a seat, sitting down with a dignified flourish. “Hello, Vivian. I didn’t expect to see you here,” she says.', 'Dash winces.', '“Hello, Janet,” I say. I can’t bring myself to call her Mum, like she insists, even though my own mother is dead and certainly wouldn’t begrudge Janet the title.', 'Janet begins to knit, needles flashing and clacking, building a comfortable rhythm. “We haven’t had a slow one in a while,” she notes. “It’s so nice to have a chance to say goodbye.” Given that nobody is actually talking to Gray-Granna, this patent fatuousness is clearly intended to put me at my ease, something that Janet confirms with her next words. “This is your first chance to see a passage, isn’t it, Vivian?”', 'Janet likes to ask questions she already knows the answer to. It keeps the conversation under her thumb, which is where she prefers everything in her life to reside. I don’t even bother to answer and Janet steams on, reminiscing over all the passages she’s ever seen. I already know the contents of this grim catalog, as Janet has taken care to introduce me to every family member, showing me how to care for them, and issuing dire warnings about dropping, chipping, cracking, kicking, wrinkling, shoving, tearing, or even moving the family heirlooms. Only Janet could have turned Modern Housekeeping into a necronomicon.', 'Idly I wonder what Gray-Granna thinks about this catalog. Perhaps her ears were among the first to bud and dissolve so that she wouldn’t have to hear her daughter-in-law’s roll call of the dead.', 'Lily ignores Janet—she knows the family history as well as any of us. Instead, she skips around in circles, trying to Not Catch butterflies. I suppose I should feel grateful that this is not a sad moment for her. When my paternal grandmother died, I was made to kiss her dry shriveled lips as my father held me over her open casket. I had nightmares for weeks after. Lily will have none of that—just sunlit memories of chasing butterflies.', 'I am in the midst of composing a mental note: ', ', when Lily suddenly turns to me and says, “It’s so pretty. I hope when you die, it’s as pretty and slow.” And I can’t help thinking that when I die it will be slow enough, and not pretty. Never pretty.', 'Dash tightens his mouth, and whisks Lily away for a whispered conference.', 'Lily was the only one to see Opa—Gray-Granna’s husband—make passage. This is her second death and a very different death from the first. Opa had been reading a story to her, part of a bedtime ritual that had lasted until his death. Lily’s eyes had closed and she had nearly drifted off, when Opa stopped reading. Lily waited and waited, and when she opened her eyes, there was only an empty leather armchair at the foot of her bed. Empty but for an open book and sitting where no armchair had previously sat. Lily had called us, and we had called Dr. Waterhouse and all the business of passage was got through, although Lily insisted on keeping the armchair in her room.', 'How long does it take for a woman to shed her skin and finish dying?', 'We watch for several hours. Gray-Granna becomes less and less distinct, her form collapsing and falling. The mass of butterflies finishes off her head, her thin arms, her shoulders. Now she is a torso-trunk, and all we can see is a boiling mass of cocoons and wet wings.', 'Now the legs are beginning to thin, and as they disintegrate, the mass of flesh topples forward. Upon hitting the ground, it bursts—a papery dry explosion, rather like a wasps’ nest. Only instead of angry wasps, we are left with a blue cloud of confusion.', 'Well then. We’re not going to be able to shut ', ' up in a china cabinet. “Those are tropical butterflies,” I say. “And summer’s nearly gone. How long will they live with the colder nights coming on?” I wonder what happens when they die, the butterflies. Do they have a secondary afterlife too?', 'Janet sighs. “We’d better open the greenhouse. That will do for somewhere to sleep.” She finishes counting off a row, and then collects her needles and yarn. “Lily, let’s go open the greenhouse.”', 'Somehow, the butterflies know to follow Lily. The cloud wraps around her, keeping pace. As she runs up the long slope of the lawn, all I can see are her legs and her mop of curls, dark against the blue shroud of wings.', '\\xa0', 'For the first time since her birth, I am permitted to read a bedtime story to my child. Somehow Opa and Gray-Granna usurped that right during the early sleepless days of parenthood, when we were too tired to protest the kindness. I suppose if Janet was at all inclined towards bedtime stories, it might be a luxury I’d never achieve. But Janet does not like books, and the only stories she knows are ones about dying.', 'There is a shelf of pristine Dr. Seuss books, bought by me when I was newly pregnant. They’ve never been read to Lily. Opa and Gray-Granna did not care for them. Opa deigned to read from the Lang fairy books, and Gray-Granna knew dozens of old Märchen, and that’s what Lily knows. I suppose that wouldn’t be a far cry from Janet’s catalog of family deaths. When you get down to it, all the old fairy stories get bleak.', 'After Lily slips into slumber, Dash joins me on the window seat. He gathers me into his arms and I lean into him. We used to sit like this in his university dorm, holding still and camouflaged in the sharp-edged silence of curfews.', 'The years have matured our silences, and now we watch the moonlight creep across the floor towards the bed where our daughter lies sleeping. Time slows and slivers while we hold each other. Momentarily, I feel safe, watching Lily’s small chest rise and fall. There is nothing else in the world that matters so much, and I wish this moment could last forever, that we could remain here, cocooned in moonlight.', 'But too soon my hand begins to quaver in Dash’s, and he breaks the silence as he always does, with a whispered plea to marry him. His lips in my hair, he breathes promises he knows he can’t keep. His hands tighten gently on mine, trying to still the trembling. “Viv, I don’t know that I can live without you.”', '“I said no.” I always say no. We have this down to a ritual, he and I. Every night he asks me and every night I refuse.', 'My spine is steel-straight from all the nos that have accreted over the years. It was harder to say no to Dash when I was younger, before there was Lily, before my mother died. Sometimes I wonder if he would have been quite so honest with me about the family enchantment if he’d known the cost.', 'Marrying Dash means joining the family.', '“I don’t understand why you won’t,” he says. He lies. No, that’s not the right word. Dash thinks he understands, but he can’t. “Think of what it would mean to Lily.”', '“I have.” I disentangle my treacherous fingers from Dash’s. “It’s not enough. Or it’s too much. I won’t be subsumed. It’s Lily’s birthright—if she wants it—but I don’t.”', 'At least Dash never mistakes my reluctance to join his family for anything but what it is. He knows I love him, just as he knows that I will not change my mind on this. But it’s not in his nature to give up.', '“Look,” Dash says, low and fervent, as he follows me into the corridor. “That’s why I wanted you to see Gray-Granna’s change. I wanted you to see how beautiful it could be. How comforting it is for Lily to know that her great-grandmother is still with her. How we can still bask in her presence.”', '“I know that.” I feel a million years old.', '“You didn’t see anything with Opa,” he says. “I wouldn’t blame you for not believing. It’s so different when they go fast.”', 'I take a deep breath and try to explain. “It’s not a matter of believing or not believing. It’s a matter of choice.”', 'Dash nods eagerly, thinking he’s snagged my attention. “You might be anything. You could be a warm blanket for Lily. A lamp for her to read by. You could be—“', '“A decaying shell. Cold flesh and food for worms.”', '“Dammit,” Dash snaps. “How is that going to help your daughter? How is that a comfort for me?”', '“How is it not? It’s my abandoned body. Can’t I feed the worms if I want?”', '“Don’t you think it’s selfish not to leave something that Lily can see, that she can tell her children about?”', '“Don’t you think it’s a bit much to expect me to define my entire life by my motherhood and the expectation that my daughter will want me around forever? I’ll be just as useful as worm meat as I would be in the house.”', '“What about a tree?” Dash pleads. “It’s not a far jump from worm food to a tree. The terminal folks plant them over graves. I’ve seen them do it. You could be shade in the summer, warmth in the winter.”', 'A tree is almost tempting, but I’ve thought this through. “You don’t know, do you, if they really choose what they turn into?”', 'That quiets him, as it always does. He doesn’t know. None of them do. Once the process has begun—fast or slow—none of the dying have ever spoken. Dash’s family doesn’t do last words.', 'I am not sure that I want this for Lily. I’m equally not sure that I can change that now. But the idea of her living her life on this estate, part of the family funeral cult, gives me the creeps. Every Karner comes here to die.', 'The house once charmed me, when Dash first brought me round to meet his parents. The oldest part of it dates back to the late 1700s, a stone root cellar laid in by Dash’s many-times great-grandfather. Every generation added on to it, Dash said, which accounted for its higgledy-piggledy lopsided character. Delightful, right? But I thought they’d built it, with wood and stone and labor under the sun.', 'I was wrong. The house grew…organically. The turret tower where Lily sleeps is furnished with a white canopy bed with pink curtains—a gift from her great-great Aunt Rosie, who died tragically at the age of three from scarlet fever. The library—Great-great-great Uncle Irving. The greenhouse—distant cousin, Ida, reportedly something of a botanist. The bed where we conceived Lily: Great-great-great-great-Aunt Minerva. Aunt Augustine’s dish set isn’t just an heirloom—it really is Aunt Augustine. Over half the house is dead relatives.', 'Lily inherits all of this.', '\\xa0', 'Lily insists on accompanying me to the doctor. She guards me like a small brown bulldog with a suspicious stare. Only reluctantly can she be pried from my side, when the nurses call me back to take my blood pressure. Even then, she scorns the plastic Fisher-Price playset offered up by the receptionist. Instead she unfolds a medical pamphlet on urinary tract infections. “I’ll be good,” she promises before I’m led away.', 'My regular doctor is out of town. They shunt me off to the covering physician, a Dr. Blake. He is younger than me, and brimming over with enthusiasm. Keen, some might say. He tut-tuts over my charts. He asks me to hold out my arms and gives me objects to clench in my fist. He has me walk a length of hallway. He tests my reflexes, and then asks if I’m having any problems swallowing.', '“Not yet,” I say. ', ' is the answer to nearly everything. Only my trembling hands and my mother’s early death give the game away.', 'Dr. Blake seems dissatisfied with my answers. He asks the same question several ways before finally giving me what he seems to think is a paternal and stern gaze. “Mrs. Karner—“', '“Dawes,” I correct. “I’m not a Karner.”', '“Kept your name, did you?” Dr. Blake says dubiously. I don’t bother to correct this misapprehension, although I consider waiting until old Dr. Waterhouse can return. Dr. Waterhouse knows not to ask about the state of Dash and me.', '“Ms. Dawes, I need you to be honest with me. We don’t judge, you know. We’re just here to help. But it’s going to be hard for me to help you if you won’t be honest with me. We need your history unvarnished. You don’t need to edit for us.”', '“I don’t know what you mean,” I say. I really don’t. Dr. Waterhouse has all my history. “My charts are right there, but I don’t think I’ve left anything out.”', 'Dr. Blake looks at me kindly. “You said you’d experienced no new symptoms of note, but you failed to mention the hallucinations.”', '“The hallucinations?” I repeat, baffled. “What hallucinations?”', '“I realize this must be very difficult for you. It’s hard to admit when—“', '“What hallucinations are you talking about?”', 'He looks sheepish. “I overheard you talking with your daughter about her grandmother’s death. I know it must have been traumatic for you. I need to ask what medications you are on. We might need to adjust their dosages.”', 'Realization sinks in. He had overheard Lily and me talk about Gray-Granna turning into butterflies, and he had assumed that I couldn’t have seen that, I must’ve been hallucinating. Lily, of course, was only a child. Prone to flights of fancy, or maybe she’d been humoring me. That’s what he’d think.', '“You seem to have misheard the context,” I explain stiffly. “I assure you I’m not hallucinating.”', 'A frown tugs at the corners of his mouth, but he pushes it back to cheerfully assure me that I may not think I’ve been hallucinating but…', '“There are no buts. I’ve been perfectly lucid. You misunderstood.” I stand up to indicate that this visit is over.', 'His eyes narrow. He isn’t done examining me, although I’m done being examined. Dr. Waterhouse would know, I think resentfully. Dr. Waterhouse has been the family physician his whole life. He writes the death certificates for the family. He’s never once asked to see the bodies. He knows, I expect, what he’d find…or not find.', 'I push past Dr. Blake and collect Lily from the waiting room. She pockets a pamphlet on iron deficiency when she thinks I’m not looking.', '\\xa0', 'Dash and I argue that evening. I tell him we need to tell Lily.', '“Do you know what I found between ', ' and ', '?” I ask him. “‘The Ten Warning Signs of Heart Disease Women Most Ignore.’ She knows something is wrong. Just not what.”', 'Dash runs his hands through his hair. “I don’t want to tell her anything until I know what I can tell her to expect. You’ve got to make a decision, Viv.”', 'I cross my arms over my chest. “I made a decision. You just refuse to accept it.”', '“That was not a decision,” Dash says. “That was you blindly accepting tradition, embracing the status quo.”', '“Whose status quo?” I ask. “Your family’s ways are…”', '“They’re a gift,” Dash says.', '“You think they’re better than what regular folks do.”', '“Aren’t they?” By now, his hands have raked his hair up in tufts. “Nobody dies to be forgotten. Nobody gets pumped full of chemicals and dumped into a cement tomb in the ground. Nobody dies in hideous pain.”', '“But they still die,” I point out. “I’m still going to die too. I’ll still be gone.”', 'Dash blinks hard against this statement. “Not if you become family.”', 'Here is the Gordian knot that rubs between us when we hold each other. I am not a Karner. I love Dash, he loves me, we have a daughter binding us together. We are family but not. I’m on the outside. By choice, I remind myself.', '“I won’t.” Can’t. Shouldn’t. What are the words that will explain this to him? I have no idea.', 'He flinches. “Fine. I’ll let you explain it to Lily. It’s your choice after all.”', '“Why do you always pretend like it’s Lily I’ll be hurting most? Why not just say that you want it for you, and acknowledge it’s for your own selfish reasons?”', 'Dash exhales long and slow before making a reply. “I thought I had. That wasn’t good enough. And Lily isn’t good enough either.” He turns on his heel and walks out of the room, leaving me to wonder why I’ve held my ground on this for so long.', '\\xa0', 'We hold a memorial service for Gray-Granna two weeks after her death. Two weeks gives the Karner cousins time to all wend their way back to the family estate. Two weeks for Janet to stage-manage the expectations of the town. Litchfield is small, and it’s not every day a Karner dies. They showed up in force for Opa’s service, and that seems to have only sharpened their curiosity. Dr. Waterhouse is discreet, but it’s obvious that rumors still leak out.', 'The pastor delivers the same sermon for Gray-Granna that he did for Opa. Something about Jesus coming forth on the third day, returning to Mary in the garden. He does not add, “As a wheelbarrow.” No, that’s Lily, sotto voce. She looks up at me and adds softly, “Or a watering can.”', 'After the service, people come to the house one or two at a time, bearing cold, foil-wrapped pans. I take the pans, and Dash leads them away into the sitting room to offer condolences to Janet and Carl and a small cortege of Karner cousins. After each terminal visitor departs, Janet wonders aloud what each of them would turn into, if they weren’t terminal, poor things. (Does Janet conveniently forget that she’d be terminal too, but for Carl?)', '“She’s too solid,” says Janet, offering analysis on the latest visitor. “Inanimate for sure. Wood possibly. She’d make a lovely wardrobe. Or a desk. Very practical.”', 'I blink. You’d think after nearly a decade of life with Dash, I’d be used to Janet. In a way, I’m relieved that she still has the power to startle me. It means I’m not growing like her.', 'I eye her over the top of Lily’s head and Dash’s shoulders. She is not a bad person. She loves Carl, loves Dash, loves Lily. Tolerates me. She wants me in the family because it will please Dash. Another Karner to catalog and care for.', 'If you are Janet, the only thing that matters is how you die.', 'Funny thing, that’s what matters most to me as well.', 'The parade of visitors eventually swells to claustrophobic proportions. The smell of white waxy flowers chokes the air and everyone speaks in that soft voice common to funerals. As if they’d rather not breathe in the mortality that still lingers. Janet reigns over this panoply of grief like a queen. She is in her element, inclining her head just so as each curious townsperson trundles through. I grudgingly admit that she fields their inanities far better than I ever could.', 'Back in the kitchen, surrounded by casseroles, I spend my time plotting my escape. And Lily’s. Is it possible? I need out, even if Dash can’t see it. I can’t handle it much longer. If I only have a few years left to me, then I don’t want to spend them living in Litchfield. All I want is to die in my own manner, to be held by my love, and to set my daughter free to live a life instead of shackled to the family heritage.', 'But I might settle for being free and away from Janet.', 'Dash sidles into the kitchen. “Hiding, Viv?” He doesn’t wait for an answer but produces a small snifter and pours himself some brandy.', '“As much as you are,” I say.', 'He smiles wryly to admit the truth of that. “I hate this part of things. Everybody pretending that they knew Gray-Granna to speak to. Everybody wearing black when they’re only curious.”', '“It’s exactly like my grandmother’s funeral,” I say. “Terminal folks face the same social hazards in grief, I guess.”', '“It smells in there,” Dash mutters. He tosses back the brandy and makes a face. “This tastes like funeral flowers.”', '“Let’s go outside,” I suggest. “Get some air.”', 'He hesitates.', 'I take the brandy glass from his hand, put it down on the counter, give it a pat. “Janet and Carl are holding down the fort. Your cousin Sandra is fielding the funeral meats for a moment.”', 'As if to prove this point, Sandra backs into the kitchen, bearing a Tupperware dish and a bouquet of irises. She pops the seal on the Tupperware and says, “Mmmmmm, ambrosia salad. My favorite. The pastor’s wife makes it special. It’s my favorite thing about a passage.”', 'Dash nods solemnly. “Go ahead and start without us. I won’t tell anyone.”', 'Sandra licks her lips in anticipation. “Well, maybe just a nibble. After I find a vase for these beauties. Georgie, do you think?”', 'Cousin Georgie is a cut glass decanter with art nouveau swirls. The irises match perfectly. Sandra bears off Georgie and the flowers to be shown to Janet.', '“Let’s go,” I say again to Dash.', 'We collect Lily from the front stairs where she has been watching grown-ups say grown-up things. She informs me that too many people are touching her, ruffling her curls, patting her head. Lily hates to be touched by strangers.', '“They keep telling me to not be sad, Mom,” she says. “Am I supposed to be sad?”', '“Maybe. I don’t know,” I tell her, softly. Conspiratorially.', 'Dash looks at us. “I’m sad.”', 'We look at him.', '“Well, I am,” he says, stuffing his fists into his pockets. He kicks the gravel in the driveway and it flies up in a satisfying spray. He kicks it again. Harder. The tiny patter of falling pebbles sounds like the first drops of rain before a sudden downpour. “I’m. Sad.”', '“I know,” I say to him, taking his hand. “Butterflies aren’t the same.”', 'His fingers tighten on mine and we start walking down the gravel, all three of us kicking it up together. Kicking because it feels really good to kick something. And then we run out of gravel where the drive empties onto the paved road leading to and from Litchfield. I hold my breath.', 'Dash breathes deep and repeats his heresy. “I’m sad.” But this time he’s not saying it for Gray-Granna. He’s saying it because he’s never been allowed to be sad before. Because being a Karner means being happy at passage.', 'Lily pats his hand. “It’s okay, Dad.”', 'We step onto the asphalt together and start walking westward. I decide that it’s time to tell my daughter how I intend to die.', '\\xa0', '“Blue Morphos in the Garden” copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Lis Mitchell.', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Mary Haasdyk.']}\n"

He watches the lime-green holo of the restaurant sign jitter and swirl through the dark, watches moths flock to it in spirals.', 'The beef kebabs arrive first, steaming on their skewers. Mars slides them onto the plate and wolfs them down, barely chewing; he cannot feel them burning his fingertips or mouth. Pork works better for his purposes, but it is difficult to find here.

In that moment Mars cleaves him open from his hip bone to his sternum.', 'He whirls on the others, slips under a punch and pulls the man close, making him a shield as another gun goes off. Small caliber this time—a bullet clips his shoulder and he barely notices it. Three quick stabs as he pushes forward; he drops his dying shield and drives the nanoknife into the arm of the shooter. The gun fires one last time and he takes the bullet right in the chest. For a split second his whole body shudders.

Luckily she wore a thick woolen cap, so the blow was softened. But her body took a full hit. She stayed down on the pavement long moments—breathless, shaken, and heart-poundingly disoriented. The dog stood calm nearby, staring at her.', 'When she got back to the apartment her stricken face said it all. Doing the dishes at the kitchen sink he looked up, saw her, and hurried over. “What’s wrong? What happened?” He made her sit down and drink a cup of tea. Unsteadily, she recounted the trauma. Talking it over with him helped a little to lessen the aftershocks but not enough. A fall like that always reminds us how, in a second, life can skid off the road straight into our very own black hole. Down deep we know sooner or later it will, God forbid. A trip, a bad stumble, stagger, and fall shouts the ugly fact we’re never ', ' in charge or control of our steps, our days, our lives.

But the anticipation was too great and he had to get up and go see.', 'She stood in front of the mirror, twisting from side to side, hands on her hips. The livid black bruise on her thigh was about ten inches long and spelled out in perfectly shaped block letters: MAMA BRUISE.', 'He winced when he saw it. “Jesus!”', '“Where is he?” she asked quietly, still looking in the mirror.', '“I guess in the kitchen in his bed.”', 'She looked at him. “Are you sure?”', '“No. Do you know what you did? What might have caused it?”', 'She shook her head. “No, nothing—I did everything as I always do. Gave him the same amount of food, took him out when he likes to go\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. but then this. It’s getting worse. You know that—it’s getting worse.”', '“What can we do? We’ve tried everything but nothing works. He just seems to get angrier. It’s almost every day there’s something that bothers him.”', 'It had begun weeks before, on the night they went to the opera. In the excitement of preparing for the special night out, they’d forgotten to feed the dog. During intermission, the man went to the refreshment stand to buy two glasses of champagne. Taking his wallet out of his pocket, he saw written in what looked like thick, purple magic marker on the back of his right hand the word LADDIE. He stood there, scowling. When and why the hell did he write ', ' there? He had absolutely no idea. It was just weird. Wetting his left thumb, he tried to wipe the word off but to no avail. Days later, it was still there, although it had just recently slowly begun to fade.', 'That night, after they returned home late from the opera, the man was opening a can of the dog’s food and half-consciously noticed the name on the label: LADDIE.', '\\xa0', 'A week later it was the cookies.

Why?”', '“Didn’t you see what was on the table in there?”', 'He looked puzzled. “No—there was nothing.”', ' She got up from the couch and crossed the room to enter the kitchen. The table was empty. No cookies, no green plate. She looked quickly around, then down at the ground just in case. For a moment she questioned whether or not\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. Damn it, of course she did! She’d baked the cookies half an hour ago and put a plate of them out on the table for him when he got home. Happy birthday. The room even still smelled of baking. So where the hell were they? The dog lay on its bed at the far end of the room, watching them. She looked its way, wondering for a second if maybe it had eaten them. But if that were so, where was the plate?', '“This is nuts! Where did they go?”', 'He stood behind her. “Where did ', ' go?”', '“Cookies! I made cookies for your birthday and— Wait a minute.” She went to a cabinet over the sink and opened it.

I hope you like it.”', 'But she already knew he would because he’d been talking about getting a really good cowboy hat for months. She thought they looked dorky on anybody except cowboys a hundred years ago. But he loved them so she kept her opinion to herself and bought him a genuine, top-of-the-line Stetson Silverbelly 10X Shasta Fur Felt Hat—the gold standard of cowboy hats.', 'Taking the box over to the table, he put it there and sat down in front of it, placing his hands on the red bow. He grinned and she was really excited to see how he would react when he saw what it was, although she kept thinking about those stupid cookies.', '“What is it?”', '“See for yourself, birthday boy.”', '“You always give great presents.”', '“Open it.” She stood a few feet away from him, so at that angle she couldn’t quite see into the box.', 'He pulled slowly on the red ribbon and it slid off. He took off the top of the box and looked inside, his expression all happy anticipation—for a few seconds. Then it changed. It torqued into a sort of quizzical smile, an “am I being tricked?” smile. An “I don’t get it” smile.', 'She read the confusion immediately and came over to look. Inside the box was a green plate with five chocolate chip cookies on it.', 'The couple looked at each other skeptically, wondering if a trick was being played.

From his perspective—was she playing some kind of not terribly funny prank on him on his ', '?', 'They’d been going through a rocky period lately, and at one point had only just brought their boat into shore before their emotional storms grew fierce enough to capsize them. Sometimes they still looked at each other warily, sadly, worriedly, both wondering if their marriage was strong enough to survive. In happier times they would have taken this moment to look slyly but delightedly at each other and assumed the best kind of joke was being played on them by their partner. But now, if this “what’s in the box?” was a joke, their gut reactions were mixed.', '“There’s only five.”', '“What?”', 'She pointed at the cookies. “There’s only five there. One is missing. I put six cookies on that plate.”', 'They looked around the kitchen, as if the missing cookie might have escaped the plate while it was being put inside the box.', '“Did you do this? Did you know about the hat?”', '“', ' hat?” he asked.', 'She needed a long silent moment to look at him, at his expression, to make sure he was telling the truth.

It didn’t, of course, so she fretted about too many unknowns and unlikely possibilities, most of which never happened. Time and again, her husband told her she was too full of what ifs, and more times than he liked to admit, they screwed up the balance of their relationship.

They all know that, with his mixed knowledge, no matter how debased it is, he’s a threat, and they’re out to get him.”', '“Get him? Why? What did he do?”', '“Nothing. He didn’t do anything—somehow it was done to him or it happened by mistake. He’s like a calf born with two heads. A freak, but a dangerous one, because he knows things he’s not supposed to. We’re not supposed to communicate with animals, or know what happens to us after we die. But he does, so as long as he’s alive he might tell us—” She stopped, cocked her head to one side, and held up a finger for him not to speak.', 'In the midnight quiet that followed, after a few moments they both heard it—a faint scratching. A faint scratching on their front door. Then loud sniffing—scratching and sniffing. Then, their ears attuned to the sounds, they heard more of them, many more just outside the house, all of them near, all of them growing louder. Scratching, hard scratching now, frantic sniffing and whining. Louder, all those familiar sounds times ten, louder and more every minute, everywhere out there in the night. Very close.', '\\xa0', '“Mama Bruise” copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Jonathan Carroll.', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Mark Smith.']}\n"

The word meant nothing to him.', 'The boy cocked an eyebrow but did not actually sneer. “Just read the slip of paper. Since you’re new to this, I’ll explain that you’re supposed to give me some brass in gratitude for my diligence. Sixpence is customary.”', 'Ritter gave the boy a coin—threepence, for he disapproved of insolence in the lower classes—and, closing the door firmly, read: MURDER AT THE DEPOT. YOU ARE NOW ACTING DIRECTOR. CAR ON ITS WAY.', 'By the time Ritter had slapped water on his face and donned a fresh shirt, one of the new motor carriages, with its two-stroke engine and eerie lack of horses, was outside his door. Minutes later, his wolf lying at his feet, he was being briefed on the essentials of the murder, while the carriage sped through the night at the breakneck speed of twenty miles per hour.', 'The Depot was located miles outside of London on a lonely country road. At the sentry hut, Ritter presented his papers and the guard raised the pole to let them pass. They followed a glow in the sky for what seemed a very long time before coming to the main gate. An endless fence stretched in either direction from twin guardhouses. Behind it were row upon row of war machines.', 'Here, Ritter was directed to get out of the car and wait. A not-unreasonable time later, Major Jeffries, the Depot’s commander, hurried up to shake his hand. “I’ll be your escort. We walk, I’m afraid. No civilian vehicles. The regulations are most firm about that.”', '“It will give me time to learn more about what happened.” The gates closed behind them and they walked between long lines of armored cannon-cars which, if Ritter’s memory served him right, had been dubbed ', '. Though it was an overcast, moonless night, they could be seen clearly, thanks to sputtering electric arc lamps raised regularly on a series of tall poles. The cold, unhealthy light gleamed on the rows of weaponry and on puddles from a recent rainstorm. “The murder took place in the old mill, I understand?”', '“Everyone here calls it the Spook House. Your Sir Toby had it made into a kind of conference facility, which he could use for meetings where security was of utmost importance.” Jeffries, Ritter had been told, was a solid man. Conscientious, hard-working, unimaginative. A perfect fit for Ordnance and just this week put in charge of the Depot to free up a man better suited for combat.', '“Yes, I have been there.”', '“Forgive me. I’m new to this post,” the major said. Then, “You have noted how many guards there are? This is the most secure site in all Europe.”', '“Yet they did not stop the assailant. Which means that it was an inside job.”', '“Yasss…” Major Jeffries looked off into the distance, as if searching for his rapidly receding career. Then, all business again, “Present at the time were three guards and three civilians: the building manager, a cook, and your Mr. MacDonald.”', 'Ritter stopped. “', ' MacDonald, do you mean?”', '“Yes. You know him, I assume?”', '“Very well, unfortunately.”', 'Spook House was an old rustic mill alongside a stream that meandered incongruously through seemingly endless ranks of mobile cannons. Ritter noted with approval that the guards at the entryways—front, back, and one side—had been doubled and looked alert.', 'A phantom jackdaw, glowing bright as if lit by the morning sun, flew past Ritter’s face and through the wall as they approached the mill. Major Jeffries flinched back from the apparition. Seeing the man’s horrified expression, Ritter said, “You were not told about this?”', '“I…somebody started to say something. But it was nonsense, so I cut him off.”', '“I see.” Ritter looked carefully about, then drew Major Jeffries away from the building and, speaking in a low voice so they could not be overheard, said, “You should have been briefed. What I will now tell you is classified Most Secret by His Majesty’s Government. You know the punishment for sharing such information.”', '“I do.”', 'Quickly, Ritter sketched out the existence of MacDonald’s organization of scryers—though not its name or location—systematically peering into the future to relay back schematics of technology that would not be invented for many decades yet. “That is why the sudden appearance of all these wondrous weapons that surround us.” The major nodded, clearly untroubled by what he had heard. Unimaginative indeed! Ritter thought. “However, there is a price. Think of our voyage through time as a path, one of an infinite number of forking paths constantly diverging in a dark wood. Every anomalous”—Ritter pronounced the English word with care—“invention jolts us onto a new path, one we were not destined to trod. The universe knows we do not belong here and tries to jolt us back. However, the momentum”—again, he spoke carefully—“of our journey keeps us going. So, briefly, two paths overlap and something that does not belong in our world appears.”', '“Ghosts, you mean?”', '“Sometimes. It depends on how much pressure the universe applies. If there is enough, a man might walk into our world from one that no longer exists and…” Ritter was going to say, ', ', but changed it to, “…shake hands with you.”', 'The major shuddered. “I will confess that the bird gave me a start.”', '“You will get used to it,” Ritter assured him. “And worse.”', 'The building manager was waiting for them. He was compact, a touch chubby, and, given the circumstances, preternaturally composed. He introduced himself as Nigel Mouldiwarp. “Mr. Ritter,” Major Jeffries said, inadvertently accentuating Ritter’s provisional status by dropping his military title of ', ', “is Acting Director of Intelligence. He will be conducting the investigation.” Turning to Ritter, “I imagine the first thing you’ll want to see is the corpse?”', 'Ritter indicated this was so.', 'Leading them inward, Mouldiwarp said, “He has—had, rather—an office here. He was found at his desk.”', 'Ritter sent Freki, who had sharper senses than he, in first to sniff things out. Thus, by the time he saw the body—mustached, grossly corpulent, and thrown back in its chair by the force of the bullet to its brow—Ritter already knew it was dead. Despite the blood that had flowed from the bullet hole, the facial features were unmistakable.', 'After a long, grim silence, Ritter said, “There can be no doubt of it. This is Sir Toby.”', '\\xa0', 'Sir Toby was dead.', 'Ritter felt a visceral shock at seeing the body. It was a terrible thing to see a close friend, comrade-in-arms, and military superior lying lifeless before oneself. Nevertheless, there was work to be done. After a long and careful examination of the crime scene, he directed Major Jeffries to send for a detail to remove the corpse. Then, because there was no point in putting it off, he went to confront MacDonald.', 'A good half of the mill’s space had been converted to a thoroughly modern conference room with a long table at its center, comfortable chairs scattered here and there, and a map of Europe dominating one wall. A modest coal fire in a fireplace to one end burnt off the worst of the autumn chill. MacDonald himself was fussing over what appeared to be a scientific apparatus on the table. Standing nearby were a guard and a young woman who could only be Lillian Willowes, the facility’s cook.', '“Where are the other guards?” Ritter said without preamble.', 'MacDonald looked up with a small, infuriating smile. “They have been questioned and dismissed.”', '“What?!”', '“They were innocent and I have proved it. So they are no longer needed. Hullo, Ritter. Still as stuffy as ever, I see. But let me explain. This device”—he stroked the apparatus before him as if it were a cat—“will make your job obsolete.”', 'Under other circumstances, Ritter might have felt a flicker of amusement. “It talks to wolves?”', '“Don’t be tedious. Your job as an investigator, I mean. All that running around, asking questions, crawling about on carpets and rummaging through dustbins, looking for clues. The mechanism is properly called a polygraph, but my scryers assure me that it will come to be universally known as a lie detector. It measures and records blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity—all physiological indices that change when an individual feels threatened or nervous, as liars inevitably do. The leads are attached here, here, and here.” MacDonald demonstrated by attaching them to the young soldier. “I will now ask a series of questions the responses to which will be recorded on a moving paper tape.” Four pens quivered at the ends of long, spidery wire arms. “When the guilty individual is confronted with a question bearing upon his crime, the device will record his evasiveness.”', '“Suppose he is a very good liar?” Ritter asked.', 'MacDonald looked superior. “He would have to be a damnably calm fellow indeed to experience no fear when his very life is on the line. But allow me to demonstrate.” He flicked a switch on the machine and, turning to the guard, said, “State your name.”', '“Private Timothy Sutton, sir.” The pens scratched up and down, leaving four jagged but roughly parallel scribbles on the tape.', '“Where were you when the murder occurred?” The pens leaped wildly.', '“On guard duty. By the kitchen door.”', '“Alone?”', '“Yes.”', 'Again, the pens leaped.', 'Freki, meanwhile, had been moving quietly about the room, sniffing the shoes and hands of all present. The cook had her hands clasped behind her back and when his wet nose touched them, she jumped and then turned a crimson red.', '“The other guards testified that Miss Willowes brought them a cup of hot cider. Did she do the same for you?”', 'A third leap, even more pronounced.', '“It was cold and damp, sir. I was grateful for her kindness.”', 'Ritter glanced at the sheet from which MacDonald was reading and saw that the list of questions was very long indeed. So he stood Freki up and made him attempt to leap up and place his forelimbs on the cook’s shoulders. She shrieked and backed hastily away.', 'Putting on a voice that his wolf had been trained to recognize as insincere, Ritter scolded, “Down, Freki! Down! If you can’t behave, I’ll just have to put you out in the hallway.” Then, suiting deed to words, he opened an interior door and shooed Freki off to examine the rest of the mill.', '\\xa0', 'Moving all but silently, Freki went first to the building manager’s room and smelled nothing more than expected: hair oil, shoe-blacking, cigarette ash, whiskey from a flask of modest proportions, a cup of tea left on the windowsill and long grown cold. The wainscoting in the hall smelled of wood polish and the carpet of rug cleaner; Mouldiwarp, it seemed, took his duties seriously. There was a supply closet, which Freki could not enter because the door was firmly shut, containing various cleaning supplies. It smelled very strongly of bleach. He passed by Sir Toby’s office, which had already been examined, though Ritter noted that the taint of putrefaction there was fading quickly.', 'The kitchen pleased the wolf for it was full of interesting odors and all of them save for the pervasive scent of cooking coal, were pleasant: hot cider in a pot still steaming atop the cast-iron stove, flour, raw red meat (chiefly mutton), kidneys and mustard, sprouts, cabbage, raisins, vinegar, cucumber, gingerbread. Lingering underneath those, from long-forgotten meals: fried fish, boiled tripe, batter for Yorkshire pudding, and the laundry smell of suet boiled in a cloth. Not yet cleared away were some chopped ham and mango chutney, the makings of Sir Toby’s favorite snack, Bengal toast, an emptied plate of which still sat on his desk. Wartime shortages and rationing did not, it appeared, apply to the head of British Intelligence.', 'Finally, the wolf went into the little room behind the kitchen where the cook slept: floral sachets, a small bottle of rose water on her dresser, beeswax for her embroidery, and various cleansing agents, laundry soap dominant. Freki carefully sniffed the girl’s unmade bed and then returned to sit down outside the door to the conference room and await his master’s emergence.', 'Within, MacDonald had finally finished his interrogation of the soldier. Drawing Ritter and the major aside, he said in a low voice, “The man is undoubtedly guilty. You see?” He pointed at spikes in the irregular line that ran across a yard’s worth of paper in his hands. “His tale of the discovery of the body is completely false! He can only be the assassin.”', '“Please,” Ritter said. “Stop this nonsense.” Turning away from MacDonald’s astonished face, he raised his voice. “Mr. Mouldiwarp, I would like to hear how you discovered the murder.”', '“There is very little to tell,” the man said. “Sir Toby had informed me that I would not be needed for anything, so I was in bed, asleep, when the gun went off. I hurriedly dressed myself and arrived at the master’s office simultaneous with Miss Willowes and Private Sutton. Inside, he was as you have seen. Mr. MacDonald heard our exclamations and joined us very soon thereafter. Private Sutton examined the master and declared him dead. There is one of the new telephonic devices in the office. I used it to summon Major Jeffries.” He paused. “I can think of nothing more.”', '“So the other guards did not rush in? Wasn’t that odd?”', '“They testified that they mistook the sound for thunder,” MacDonald said. “There was a bit of a storm at the time. So it is telling that Sutton alone identified the sound correctly. The polygraphic device records his alarm when I asked him about that. Also, Mouldiwarp was delayed by the need to dress, while the others—”', '“Your testimony is worthless,” Ritter said, “and therefore I shall ignore it. While you were playing with your little toy, I have been hard at work assembling a very good picture of all that happened.”', 'All present gaped at him in astonishment.', '“I shall address the question of the tardiness of two of our suspects first. Miss Willowes is not only a lovely young woman but good-hearted as well, as witness her distribution of hot cider to the guards on duty. I imagine most of the soldiers on the base fancy themselves half in love with her. The conference center is used only sporadically. It is only natural that a lonely woman frequently left alone in a house haunted by phantoms and sourceless noises should find a stalwart young soldier a reassuring presence. By slow degrees, she would find herself returning the emotions he feels for her. Earlier tonight, Private Sutton stepped into the kitchen for a quick kiss or two from his sweetheart.” The two had, by the scents on the cook’s bedclothes, done a great deal more than kiss. But Ritter was a gentleman, so he left it at that. Addressing the young couple directly, he said, “When you heard the gunshot, you both naturally consulted each other to make certain you were not mistaken about its nature. Am I right?”', 'Miss Willowes blushed and stared down at the floor. After an almost imperceptible hesitation, Private Sutton gave a tight-lipped nod.', '“Now follow me into the hallway, please.”', 'Ritter led the others to the supply room. “This is the one room that Freki was not able to examine directly, because the door was latched. If I find what I expect within, my understanding of the event will be all but complete.” He opened the door.', 'Inside the small room were the expected brooms, mops, and cleaning supplies. There was also an oversized galvanized bucket containing at least five gallons of bleach and what might be items of clothing. Ritter removed his jacket and rolled up one shirt sleeve. Carefully, he fished out an apron, a pair of white gloves, and a pistol. “You will note that the apron and gloves are discolored from powder burns. The murderer knew that a member of the Werewolf Corps would be involved in the investigation and took steps to ensure that his guilt could not be sniffed out by one such as me.” Turning to the building manager, he said, “You seem extraordinarily calm, Mr. Mouldiwarp, for someone whose employer has been murdered and whose murderer is still, presumably, among us.”', '“I am of a phlegmatic temperament, sir. That is how I got this job. The previous five men occupying it were put off by the phantoms haunting this building. Nothing much bothers me, it is simply the way I have been from boyhood.”', '“You are also very systematic. The supply room is meticulously tidy.”', '“Thank you.”', '“So if anybody but you yourself had imported so much bleach—far more than is required for such a small building—I am certain you would have noticed. It baffles me that you made no attempt to disguise something so obvious. Almost as much as it baffles me how you could have known you would have the time to commit your horrid deed, dump the incriminating evidence in bleach, and retreat to your room so you could burst out, looking—and smelling—like an innocent man.”', 'Mouldiwarp said nothing.', '“Do not think silence will help you! Miss Willowes and Private Sutton can each vouch for the actions of the other. Mr. MacDonald had no reason to kill Sir Toby—indeed, his current position is due to Sir Toby’s patronage. Were I the permanent rather than Acting Director, he would have been fired the instant I stepped into this building and he knows it.” (MacDonald shrugged in a manner indicating he doubted seriously that a foreigner would ever be made permanent Director of British Intelligence.) “The other two guards never entered the building. There is no other possible suspect than you. Admit it!”', '“Oh, very well, I killed him.” Mouldiwarp spread his hands, as if to say it was all beyond his control. “Willoughby-Quirke was considered a danger to the Empire and so I was dispatched to eliminate him. It was an act of war.”', '“You came here as a spy and an assassin. Unlike a soldier, you are subject to summary action. I could kill you here and now and there would be no one to say I was wrong to do so.”', '“But you won’t.” There was the faintest trace of a smile on Mouldiwarp’s face, as if he were in on some joke not known by the others. “You see, I am a scryer, much like your Mr. MacDonald here. I can see the future. That is how I was chosen. The Mongolian Wizard’s espionage service routinely trains precognitives as assassins. We are never sent out unless we have seen ourselves alive and well long after the event. Eighteen months from now, I will be sitting in a ', ' in Rastenburg with a stein of pilsner in my hand, a girl of loose morals on my knee, and a medal on my chest for extraordinary service to the Mongolian Wizard. So, one way or another, I will come out of this a free man. I had expected a bungled investigation, but that turns out not to be the case. So, most likely, I will be traded for one of your own assassins, caught by our people. In any event, I have nothing to fear.”', '“You sound damnably sure of yourself.” Ritter could not keep the anger out of his voice.', 'Mouldiwarp’s face was as serene as the moon. “I have seen the future. It cannot be changed. Of course I am sure.”', 'Turning to address the others, Ritter said, “There has been an assassination attempt. But, by a miracle, Sir Toby escaped unscathed. Tobias Gracchus Willoughby-Quirke remains the head of British Intelligence.” He saw MacDonald open his mouth and raise a hand to object and glared him to silence. “Those are the facts as the world must know them. Anyone caught spreading rumors to the contrary will be arrested and charged with treason. Does everyone understand?”', 'Miss Willowes’s eyes were wide when she nodded. The major, the guard, and MacDonald all tried to look manly.', '“As for this fellow,” Ritter said, drawing his automatic. “I am afraid that he was shot while attempting to escape.”', 'Mouldiwarp was still smirking in disbelief when the bullet penetrated his forehead and splattered blood and brain matter on the wall behind him. He had foreseen the wrong future.', '\\xa0', 'When Ritter returned to the carriage, the sun was coming up. The motorman leaned over from his perch and reached down with gloved hand to open the door. Ritter got in and the engine sputtered to life. When he had settled himself into the cushions, he turned to the dark figure sitting beside him and said, “You will need to have the cook transferred elsewhere if you hope to keep up the pretense that you are dead.”', 'Sir Toby sighed. “I will miss Lillian’s cooking. The girl was a dab hand at Bengal toast. Still, all must make sacrifices if the war is to be won. You uncovered the murderer, of course. I can see it in your comportment. Did my doppelganger last long enough to be removed from the mill?”', '“According to a messenger who arrived just minutes ago, the body disappeared shortly after being placed in the morgue.”', 'Sir Toby sighed deeply. “Then my timeline is the stable one, not the corpse’s. I will confess, the possibility it would go the other way had me worried. And my assassin?”', '“Using my best judgment, I executed him.”', 'Scowling, Sir Toby said, “You were supposed to arrest the man.”', '“I wanted to plant uncertainty in the enemy’s mind as to whether the assassination succeeded or not. I ordered the witnesses not to share any of the details of the execution or your death. Thus ensuring that there would be rumors. The Mongolian Wizard’s people will hear you are alive and not know whether to believe it. Their assassin will not return as he was foreseen to do. Your every action will be analyzed twice—as something you might do and as the act of an imposter. It will, however briefly, drive them mad.”', '“Why, Ritter! I begin to believe we shall make a proper spy of you yet,” Sir Toby said, with an approving smile.', '“Also, there was an even chance he had killed a man I esteemed and admired. That called for revenge.”', 'The expression soured. “Or perhaps not.”', '“I would like to point out,” Ritter said, “that your lie-detecting machine did not render me redundant, as MacDonald boasted it would. In the end, all your shiny machines were inferior to one man, one wolf, and one talent.”', 'Sir Toby drew a cigar case from his jacket, selected his victim, bit off the end, and, striking a match, puffed it to life. At last, with great solemnity, he said, “Considering, Ritter, that all our hopes of winning this war are hinged on machinery and all the Mongolian Wizard’s on talented men such as yourself, you had best pray that you are wrong.”', '\\xa0', '“Murder in the Spook House” copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Michael Swanwick.', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Gregory Manchess.']}\n"

One determined reporter, Jonathan Hive, stumbles upon a lead that takes him to the south of France to discover the truth. What he finds out is a lesson in how life can bring about the most unexpected miracles.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Jonathan Tipton-Clarke—also known as Jonathan Hive, also known as Bugsy, and probably also known as a lot of other things that no one actually said to his face—drove up the impossibly picturesque country road with decreasing confidence that he was going the right way. The direction app on his phone had been silent for too long, which probably meant he’d lost the signal. The road grew narrower and narrower, curving through one tiny Provençal village after another, until the villages ran out, replaced by hillsides covered with olive groves and vineyards, and the soft, golden light that had given Impressionist painters ecstatic fits. He ought to be enjoying this. The assignment—track down and interview a “person of interest” who might or might not have been involved with a terrorist attack on Jerusalem almost twenty years ago—had been an excuse to spend time in the south of France on an expense account. He didn’t expect to actually find Zoe Harris.', 'While he might have had romantic spy thriller notions about chasing down leads across the Middle East, the task had been bureaucratic and dull. Old-fashioned detective work, poring over records, asking the right questions, offering a bribe here and there to get a look at files he maybe shouldn’t have seen. He hadn’t even had to use his ace, much. Fortunately, Harris had spent a lot of time in countries without strict HIPAA requirements. He started with her last known location—Jerusalem, 1994—and her last known associates. The problem was, most of them had died in the disaster. The sheer scale of it—five thousand dead from a biological attack, a weaponized version of the Black Trump virus that killed any wild carder who came in contact with it—meant records were spotty. A lot of people disappeared. But Harris popped back into the record once or twice over the years. A couple of arrests, a couple of hospitalizations—she’d apparently had a rough go of it.', 'Then he found a mug shot from a hospital in Cairo. Didn’t have a name attached to it, but the ash-blond hair and angry expression matched an earlier passport photo. Harris was an ace who could animate small objects. According to the hospital records, her power was out of control. She was a danger to herself and others and had been kept sedated for years. Then she disappeared, again. Released, homeless, most likely. She was probably dead at the bottom of the Nile.', 'Except… a decade ago, a woman named Zoe Harris popped up as the president of a small chemical company in Toulouse, France. Couldn’t be the same person, could it? This Harris was reclusive. He couldn’t find any pictures of her. So he asked for a meeting, and now he was on his way to meet her. Assuming he could find the address.', 'He rolled down the window, set his arm on the edge, and let loose a couple of bugs. Bottle-green wasps popped from his hand and were whisked away by the wind of the car’s passage. That was Jonathan’s own weird and occasionally surprisingly useful ace: He could turn into an equivalent mass of wasps and his consciousness could follow along wherever they went. He sent them straight up, high enough to give him a map-eye view of the road ahead, to make sure he was really going the right way and wasn’t about to end up in some cowshed.', 'The place wasn’t even that far ahead, turned out, and he’d been going the right way the whole time. Trust the app. Hidden behind a hill and an uninviting stone wall, Harris’s enclave was disguised as a remote country farm. No one who didn’t have a reason to be here would find it. And here he was, driving through a gap in the wall and up to a set of buildings arranged around a gravelly courtyard. Some of the structures were old, maybe even medieval—weathered gray stone, cracked Spanish tiles on the roof. One was very modern, glass and steel, with wide windows and skylights. That must hold the labs.', 'A small, unassuming sign placed in front of the modern building read ', ' in a very expensive-looking font. He hesitated a moment, hands on the steering wheel, engine idling. Did he really want to go in? Probably this Harris woman wasn’t even who he thought she was. She probably hadn’t had anything to do with anything. He’d ask her a few questions, maybe get a rundown on her perfume business, and write a puff piece for an airline magazine. Expense account justified.', 'He sent his already-released bugs ahead, along with a few more of them besides. Just to look the place over. Got the layout pretty quick. Apart from the main building, there were a number of cottages and more typical country buildings, with whitewashed walls and tile roofs, the little kitchen gardens and trash bins of any residential neighborhood. He gathered that a lot of the people who worked here also lived here. Middle of the day, no one much was out and about.', 'Zephyr was involved with processing ingredients used in perfumes, which seemed an arcane business but somebody had to do it, he supposed. The sleek modern building was the centerpiece of the estate, and a couple of the bugs skimmed over the roof. They found a vent and slipped inside. The sharp tang of volatile chemicals—alcohols, esters, solvents—almost knocked them out right then, and back in the car he shivered in response, until they got their wings back in order. If this lab really did belong to Zoe Harris, maybe-former-terrorist, was she hiding anything in plain sight here? Maybe cranking out something else besides overpowering smells? The bugs flew on through the ductwork. He was hoping he could pop them out into a room—some actual lab or even a secret storage closet—but it turned out the interior vents all had really good filters on them. He couldn’t find so much as a loose seam to crawl through. He’d have to find another way in. He diverted a couple of bugs to wait by the front door, right at the top where no one ever looked.', 'Back in the driveway, he stepped out of the rental car, shaking out his jacket and running his hands through his dark hair to make sure he didn’t look too respectable. Made him more approachable, he thought. Or maybe he was more nervous than he wanted to admit.', 'A man left the modern building and approached Jonathan. Middle-aged, with Mediterranean features and a brisk, practical walk. An eye patch over his right eye. He looked a little like a pirate. So the place had surveillance. They’d known the minute Jonathan arrived.', 'The man said, “', '”', '“Ah… ', '.” That was most of the French he knew right there.', '“Oh yes, of course. You’re American.”', 'Jonathan tried not to feel insulted. “My name is Jonathan Tipton-Clarke. I have an appointment with Ms. Harris. I assume I’m at the right place?”', '“You are; she’s expecting you. Right this way.” The man smiled thinly and gestured for Jonathan to follow him. With one last look around the yard, he did so.', 'A pair of bugs went inside when they did, and quietly buzzed off looking for whatever they could find.', 'Windows along one side of the corridor looked into a laboratory, stainless steel tables filled with glassware—flasks and bottles, the intricate tubing of distilling apparatus. Several people shrouded in white lab coats, caps, and masks seemed intent on their work, bent over metal trays, carefully lifting bits with delicate forceps.', 'The clean rooms were really clean. The wasps couldn’t find a way inside. Not that Jonathan would have known what he was looking at if they had.

She was a joker, with a face that looked melted on one side, average white middle-aged matron on the other, with brown hair tied in a ponytail. She held a tightly coiled newspaper in one hand. The pair of bugs crawled along the ceiling—well out of reach of the universal weapon of “death to insects.”', 'And then her arm stretched.

But no, I have no ties with the Fists, not anymore. The incident you’re here about was the Black Trump, the moment Jerusalem was held hostage. The Card Sharks wanted to release the Black Trump, kill every wild carder in the area. So the Fists had a bomb, a nuke. Retaliation I helped haul to the Mideast in an old Blue Bird bus.

Croyd hustled me into a jeep and drove straight out of the city, then onto a path that zigged and zagged and tracked across wet dunes and through a marsh.', 'There was a boat, sleek and fast, with four seats and a lot of inboard motor, hidden in a stand of reeds. It was black and had too much gold striping on it, like a prized drag racer from some paint shop in Jersey. Its engine was loud in the quiet. Some ducks woke up and yelled at us.', 'I noticed Croyd didn’t have a key. He used his translucent hand to reach into the ignition, to start the motor.

I was starting to really wake up. “And the jeep?”', '“Yeah.” He shrugged.', 'There was enough light for me to get scared of what I might see if I could only see better.

Even now I can smell the living water, see swirls of mist and the white wake behind us, feel the splinters of rain jabbing my face. We went through dark stretches of open water and twisting paths through low stands of what I thought might be papyrus. I didn’t know if papyrus was a thing of history or if I was looking at plain old bulrushes. Whatever they were, they were growing in shallow water. I tried not to think about what would happen if we hit a sandbar.', 'I grabbed for a handhold when Croyd hauled into a steep turn that lifted my side of the boat out of the water. He hit reverse and the boat crashed back to level and braked itself fast. We plowed through a stand of reeds and onto wet sand.', 'There was a hut. It seemed to be built of weathered gray boards. It had a tile roof that slanted back from a sort of porch. Water was pouring off a low spot in the roof and falling into a plastic barrel. A man came from beneath its shadow and ran toward us.', 'It was Needles. Needles, one of the kids I took care of in Jerusalem, but all grown up. He’s a joker, with sharp claws for hands and teeth like baleen. He looks… different now. Well fed, fit.', '“How is she?” Croyd demanded.', '“Not good,” Needles said. “Zoe. Hi.”', '“Hi,” I replied wonderingly. One of them made it. At least one of them is alive.', 'Croyd hauled me out of the boat with his solid arm and I felt a faint tremor in his hand. Uh-oh. He’d been awake for too long. What a pair we were.', '“Croyd. Why are we here?”', '“Zoe. Zoe, I couldn’t think of anyone else. She has to get help and she’s so afraid.” He grabbed me by one elbow and tugged me toward the hut.', ', I heard. We’d been lovers once, Croyd and I. We’d been through a lot. ', ' Damn him.', 'The slanted roof of the hut made the interior seem like the inside of a tent. It smelled clean. There was an oil lamp in one corner with a small, steady flame, scented with cassia and camwood, warm scents for a cold wet night. There was a sort of pallet bed on the wooden floor, its red-striped cotton covering squared off and carefully tucked in. A woman sat beside it, her feet tucked under her. Her arms were braced on the floor beside her, palms flat, to support the weight of a huge, painfully pregnant belly. Her eyes were closed tight and her fingers were puffy.', '“Rima,” Croyd whispered. “She’s here. Zoe’s here, the woman I told you about. She’ll help.”', 'She opened her eyes, the huge sloe eyes of a beauty from ', '. She was in her twenties, perhaps. Her hair was hidden by a scarf of green threaded with gold.

She can take the baby?”', '“You, she’ll help ', '”', 'At the time, I didn’t know what that meant. Or I ignored what that meant.', 'Oh, dear God. We were in the middle of nowhere. Really nowhere.

I’d seen videos of a delivery but I had never seen a live birth.', 'Needles stood like a statue at the doorway. Croyd stayed frozen where he was, crouched on the floor an arm’s length away from the woman. She breathed again. When she did, he moved no closer and said nothing at all. I think it was terror.', ' was my first thought. ', ' My vision was of sterile tiles and clever machines and brisk, efficient people in scrubs who delivered babies every day. The reality was that we were in muddy wilderness, a long way from any sign of the crowded, sprawling chaos that had been my experience of towns in the Mideast. We had a speedboat, and two men who looked ready to run like rabbits at any sudden noise. It was not a good time for me to lose it.', '“What am I supposed to do?” I asked stupidly. I was coming out of the sedative haze. My head hurt. My stomach turned over. “I can’t… I don’t… I can’t…”', 'Croyd said, “I thought… your power. You know. Maybe you can help things along. Like, move the baby out?”', 'I stared. “Croyd, that’s stupid. My power only works on inanimate objects.”', 'The woman, Rima, groaned.', '“Please, Zoe.”', 'I knelt by the woman. “When did the pains start?”', '“Yesterday,” Rima said.', 'I thought I knew that first babies take longer to get born, that labor for a first-time mother takes hours, even a whole day. I sincerely hoped I wasn’t making that up. “How far apart are they?”', 'Rima gazed directly at me for the first time. She looked a little startled. “I don’t know,” she said.', '“Let’s time them, then.”', '“I have a watch,” Needles said from the doorway. He held a finger above the face of his watch, ready to punch a button on it.', '“One’s starting now,” Rima said. She pinched her lips tight together. Her nostrils flared.', '“Breathe,” I said. “Slow, deep breaths.” It was tempting to hold my own breath until whatever this child, this woman, was feeling went away. But I knelt beside her and rubbed her shoulders.', 'We breathed.', '“Tell me when it eases,” I said.', 'Rima nodded.', 'Another breath. Another.', '“Better,” she said.', '“Two minutes,” Needles said.', 'Croyd finally approached and stroked Rima’s forearm from elbow to wrist, a gentle touch, but he stayed where he was, at arm’s length.', 'I looked at his translucent hand. “Maybe you could… with that hand… like you did with the lock.”', 'He huffed a nervous laugh. “It only works on inanimate objects.”', '“Needles, keep your eye on that watch,” I said. “We’ll tell you when the next one starts.”', 'He nodded and didn’t look up at us.', '“I’m thirsty,” Rima said.', 'Croyd patted the back of her hand and got to his feet. “I’ll get you some water,” he said.', 'There were shelves along one wall, and a Coleman two-burner camp stove on a counter.', '“How long would it take us to get to the nearest hospital?” I asked.', '“Two hours at least, Zoe,” Needles said. “There’s a canal that leads to a little harbor. No hospital. Maybe there’s a clinic there or something, but there’s been fighting in the village. Some shelling. I don’t know about tonight.”', 'Croyd opened the cap on some bottled water and brought it back to us. Rima drank deeply and handed the bottle back.', '“No. Tell her,” she said to him.', '“We can’t go to a hospital. If her father… If any of her brothers or her father find her, they’ll kill her,” Croyd said.', 'Ritual murder, a tainted woman, a disgrace to the family. I knew that story. ', '“We’ll lie about her name,” I said.', '“It’s starting again,” Rima said.', '“Four minutes since the last one,” Needles said.', '“I have to go outside.” Rima grabbed a little sack from beside the bed. She clambered to her feet and beneath the hem of the white cotton layers of her dress, I saw them for the first time, her bare little swollen feet and chubby toes. Babies’ little fat feet are pretty and healthy. Swollen feet on a pregnant woman can be an okay thing, but her ankles and her calves were swollen, too.', '“I have to—”', 'The next word was in Arabic. I went with her to the porch.', 'She limped to the side of the house and squatted. I didn’t know if a baby would fall out. I wanted to panic about that, but baby horses slid out on the ground, didn’t they? And they lived through it. I supposed there was nothing to do if that happened other than pick it up. I was extremely scared, but I couldn’t think of anything to animate that would help any of us. This would be a good time for an ace to show up and perform miracles. Didn’t look like that was going to happen, and I seemed to be all this poor girl had to cling to, so I shoved the panic aside and tried to keep on thinking.', 'In the dark and the rain, she pushed, she pooped, and her water broke. The little package was some sort of sterile wipes, and Rima used them and managed to get to her feet. There was no baby on the ground, but her dress was soaked. She began to sob.', '“Somebody bring me a towel!” I yelled.', 'Needles brought me one. I lifted Rima’s skirts and dabbed her legs and we helped her walk inside.', 'I remember how warm the little hut felt after the cold wet air of the outside, how the scented lamp cast its faint golden light.', 'She was preeclamptic, but I didn’t know that then. I didn’t know what it meant. I got her out of her wet clothes and wrapped her in blankets. We shoved the bedding in the corner and I got Croyd to sit with his shoulders braced against it so Rima could lean back against him. I asked Needles to heat water, because it’s traditional and because it kept his back to us, and I wanted some warm soapy water around for Rima and the baby. He brought water in from the barrel outside. Rima probably didn’t want any men around, but as things got busier I don’t think she cared.', 'That’s how I saw it then. Now I think her indifference was an early stage of delirium.', 'I tried to distract her. “Tell me how you and Croyd met.” ', ' Between the two of them, I got the story. They traded off, corrected each other on little details. The way couples do.', 'Rima Naji was a student at Columbia. She wanted a master’s degree when she finished her B.S. in sustainable development. Her family wanted her to come home to Port Said and marry the man they had chosen for her. She thought the prospective husband would turn down the match if she wasn’t a virgin. She went into Jokertown to find someone who could make her inconvenient hymen go away. She found Croyd in a coffee shop, freshly wakened and eating a dozen donuts.', 'It was sweet, he said. She was fascinating, and exotic, and very bright, and she had a lovely laugh.', 'I have a clip of her that I’ve saved for Jorah, a Q&A after a C-SPAN lecture where she gave an opinion disguised as a question. She was articulate and persuasive. And she was beautiful. Her dark curly hair wasn’t covered, not when she was a student in New York. I understood why Croyd fell for her. One thing led to another, and then to bed.', '“She insisted,” Croyd told me. “It wasn’t until after, until a couple of weeks after that first night, that she told me why.”', 'He had been her lover in a working city in a busy time, in a country at peace. I envied her that. When I remember the first time Croyd and I made love, I remember the fear that we did our best to escape in each other’s arms, the hope that we’d make it to shore, the smell of seawater crashing over the decks, the growling thump of the engine. We were on a creaking ship in a Mediterranean storm. The blankets smelled of diesel.', '“And then she was just gone. Poof. Gone.” As Croyd tends to be once he can’t fight off sleep anymore. “She told the guy at the coffee shop she was going to Toronto.”', 'Rima murmured, “There was nothing you could do.”', 'Holding her hand, he stared into the past. “When I woke up the next time… No, two times later; those two were bad wakeups. I tried to find her in Toronto, her name, where she lived, anything.”', '“I refused to go back to Egypt,” she said. “So my father came himself and hauled me onto a plane.”', 'Croyd said, “I got a message from a cop in Jokertown. He found me awake. She’d sent it weeks before. It said she needed help in Egypt.”', 'He didn’t say he was sorry he’d been asleep, or crazed, when she needed him. He knew I knew how life worked for him. There’s no way out for him, no escape from the cycles.', '“You found me,” Rima said. Her smile was beautiful.', '“I got a one-way ticket to Alexandria and gave this guy with a truck the name of the place she’d written down, and the next thing I knew he stopped at the side of the road by a lake.” The corner of Croyd’s mouth twisted in a sardonic smile. “Rima found ', '. When I saw her…”', 'Croyd had never looked at me the way he looked at Rima.', 'I think Rima didn’t know she was pregnant when she left New York. When that news slipped, one way or the other, and she knew her father and her brothers knew and would kill her, as required for the honor of the family, someone gave her enough money to get away from Port Said. It may have been her mom. She couldn’t buy an airline ticket in her own name, so she went west to a place she knew from her childhood. The hut was abandoned, part of a research station at a bird sanctuary. A comfortable place for rich Alexandrians to wait until it was time to get in the duck blinds for a morning’s sport. At least she and Croyd had found each other again.', 'Rima groaned. “I need to push.”', 'I held her feet so she could brace against my hands. Croyd locked his arm in front of her chest like a bar for her to hold and whispered to her, little terms of endearment that I knew from long ago.', 'It went too fast. It was the first time I’d seen how huge a baby’s head looks on its way out. Jorah’s head was a sliver of gray bulge sliding forward with contractions and then retreating again, and each push made it larger. ', ', was what I thought. This can’t ever work; human babies are too big.', 'Needles brought a basin of warm soapy water and a pile of towels he’d found by rummaging in a cabinet. He sat down beside Rima and kept one supporting hand on Croyd’s bicep. Needles rattled off some Arabic. Rima replied.', '“She says she’s trying to be brave,” Needles said.', 'Croyd whispered something in her ear. The girl smiled and then clamped her jaw and pushed again. He tried not to tremble but he was truly wired, and I saw the effort he was making.', ', I told myself. I’ve seen kittens born. Things get born and it’s usually okay. There was black silky hair beneath the membrane that covered Jorah’s head. That was a relief. It was a head coming out, not a gray monster. I guided Rima’s hand down to feel it and she smiled. I picked up a towel and held it tight against her stretched vaginal skin. ', ', that long-ago video had said. Something was going to tear, and Rima was bellowing, and Jorah’s head slipped out, facing down, the back of his head on top, a little chin where I couldn’t see it well, and membrane over it all. I wanted to get his nose free so he could breathe and his mother was no kitten; she couldn’t reach down and tear the sac away with her teeth.', '“Scissors?” I called out. “A knife? Something?”', 'Croyd rummaged in his pocket and brought out a folded pocketknife with a black-and-ivory handle. It looked like the 1950s to me. I got it open and let it fall into the soapy water. That would have to do for sterilization. Carefully made a hole in the membrane with the knife tip and pushed the cowl away from Jorah’s face. I turned his head to the side a little and wiped his nose and mouth. He blinked and stared, as calm as a Buddha. I found myself smiling.', 'I could feel Rima’s relief in the way her muscles relaxed, in the different rhythm of her breathing.', '“The head’s out,” I said.', 'Rima tried to lean forward to see. The motion pushed the rest of Jorah out into my arms, wet and slick and purple, and I thought, ', '.', 'There’s this thing about holding a baby by the heels and slapping him to make him breathe. ', ', I thought. ', 'Jorah opened his mouth, all gum and tongue, and sighed, and began to turn pink.', 'I lifted him onto Rima’s remarkably deflated belly. She reached down and stroked his head, and everything was wonderful and my next obstacle was the umbilical cord. The video had stressed that you don’t have to cut it first thing, that if you just left it where it was for a while, nothing bad would happen. But the damned cord was in my way and it looked as big as a garden hose.', 'Croyd stared at the baby wide-eyed. He looked completely dazed.', '“It’s a boy,” Croyd said. Jorah was most definitely a boy, and since I’d never seen a baby boy’s genitals at birth before, I was a little worried. They looked huge. Maternal hormones, I learned later, are the reason baby boys’ genitals are so big, relatively speaking, at birth. And they were a nice healthy red, as was the rest of him.', 'I tied the cord, in two places, as tight as I could, with dental floss, and cut between the knots with the blade facing up. The texture of the cord was tough, much like a chicken’s windpipe. Croyd kept a nice edge on his knife.', 'The baby was making sucking motions with his little mouth. I lifted him and Rima took him in her swollen hands. He found her nipple like an old pro, bless his heart, and I grabbed a towel to wipe him down a little, and then covered him with another one.', '“Oof,” Rima said when the baby began to suck. As it’s supposed to do, the breast stimulation gave her one more contraction and the placenta slid out, a purple and red mushroom the size of a big seder plate with a long stem of cord. It smelled meaty, like a slightly warmed steak. I bundled it into a plastic sack, because the video I’d watched so long ago said to do that.', '“Okay, guys,” I said. “Go out and smoke cigars or something while we clean up.”', 'They tromped out. The rain was heavier than it had been before I had stopped listening to anything except Rima’s breathing between contractions and, later, the screams that she tried not to make.', '“He’s beautiful,” Rima said.', 'He looked small to me, but I didn’t know how big or little a newborn was supposed to be. Like a nat whose skin was covered with a splotchy layer of white cheese, but a standard human, not a variant. I finished giving Rima a bed bath and pulled the coverlet up to her shoulders.', '“Take care of him,” she whispered.', 'There was something wrong with her eyes. Glassy, staring, wrong. ', ' wrong. I leaned closer to look and got the baby out of her arms when the first convulsion began.', '\\xa0', 'Jonathan stared at her across the desk, his notepad sitting forgotten in front of him. “Croyd Crenson has a kid,” he said bluntly.

Zoe Harris looked at him with a kind of forced serenity. This was a woman who had killed people. Who had planned to kill more. If she wanted to kill Jonathan, she could, and he had a sudden thought—that was the only reason she was telling him her story, because she planned on killing him. Likely, she wouldn’t be able to. Whatever she threw at him, Jonathan Hive could disintegrate into a cloud of bugs and flee. Sting her good on the way out, too.', '“There’s more,” Harris said.', '“Of course there is. This doesn’t end well, does it?”', '“It could have ended worse,” she said calmly.', '\\xa0', 'Rima might have died even in a hospital. Eclampsia still kills women, despite the sterile and steel hospitals of the so-called first world. The hypertension may have caused an intracerebral bleed, and that’s what killed her. I didn’t know that then. I didn’t know what had happened to her, the name of the disease that had killed her, or even, really, who she was.', '“Rima?” Then, “Rima, Rima, no no no—”', 'The basin that the soapy water had been in flew, hit the ramshackle wall. Water sprayed behind it. A tin cup followed it. The baby cried, and I bent my head over him and tried to get myself under control. This was me, my stress and fear. My power, out of control. Croyd never should have smuggled me out of the hospital.', 'The door slammed open, Croyd and Needles storming back in. “Rima!” Croyd choked out and rushed to her bedside, but there was nothing he could do, nothing anyone could do.', '“Zoe, it’s okay. Calm down, Zoe. Please.” Needles talked me down. Things stopped smashing into the wall. The weight of the baby in my arms anchored me.', 'The rain stopped. The hut was quiet. And Croyd murmured, “She’s gone.”', 'More quiet. For a long time. Croyd stayed frozen where he was, crouched over Rima, ready to brace her when the next seizure began. But there wasn’t another one. At last, he sat back. He fumbled inside his jacket and I knew he was searching for pills before he brought out a bottle and chewed three of them. He always wants to stay awake as long as he can. Sleep for him means he’ll wake as a different person—deuce, ace, or joker. Or he’ll draw the Black Queen and be dead. He knows more about amphetamine psychosis than anyone should have to know.', 'I’d have thought he’d want to sleep, just then. I did.', '“We should go,” Needles said hoarsely. “Her family might still find her here. But if we leave now they won’t follow us.”', '“We can’t just leave her—”', '“Yes, we can,” Needles said.', '“If nothing else, he’ll need a bottle,” I said. “Formula, diapers, surely there’s something if there’s no breast milk bank— a wet nurse, if we can find one.”', '“Croyd?” Needles pressed.', '“Yeah, okay.”', 'Too quickly, we were back in the speedboat, leaving the hut—and Rima—behind. Needles opened the throttle and the motor roared. We were in open water. Brushy little hummocks or islands broke its surface here and there. Rain tapped down on the canopy of the boat, on the surface of the lake. I thought there was a horizon ahead, a smudge of lighter sky at the edge of the dark watery world. The rich littoral smell of the water had changed. I smelled the sea.', '“What do you think?” Needles asked after a time. “The village, or back to the jeep?”', 'Croyd jerked at the sound of Needles’s voice and began turning his head to scan the water, first on one side of the boat and then the other.', 'The jeep meant a long drive back to Cairo. At the village… surely there’d be something there for the baby. Blankets. Milk.', '“Village,” I said.', '“Okay,” Needles said. “Village. Croyd, help me look out for the lights. Croyd?”', 'The man was huddled up in his seat, hugging himself, his stare vacant.', '“I’ll help,” I said softly. “Croyd? Croyd. I need you to hold the baby. Your son, Croyd.” It was the only thing I could think of to get Croyd to focus.', '“What?”', '“Here.” I went to him and pressed the baby against his chest. His one substantial arm went around him automatically, balanced him on his lap. Croyd looked startled, but he took his son and held him close. Even with one arm. He fiddled with the wrappings and pried a tiny fist out into the air. So help me, he counted fingers, which seems to be one of the things people do. The baby grabbed Croyd’s finger and held on tight. Croyd fished for feet, two, and assessed the number of toes. Five on each foot. I was counting, too.', 'The baby began to cry. Croyd wrapped his son’s feet up again and patted his little back. He tried to rock him, in a jerky sort of way.', '“Zoe? What do I do?”', '“Put him inside your jacket, for starters. We don’t want him cold.”', '“He’s ', '!”', 'He didn’t mean rain. Oh. Diaper change time. We didn’t have any diapers and we were running low on dry cloth when we left the hut. “It’ll have to wait.”', '“Jorah. She wanted to call him Jorah.”', 'Needles steered around a hummock of reeds. The patch of lighter sky I had seen before was brighter now, beams of white light strobing in smoky dust. It wasn’t dawn. It was the village, and something had gone terribly wrong there.', '“This complicates things,” Needles said. “Croyd. Whose boat is this?”', '“I don’t know,” Croyd said. “I stole it. Berth seventeen.”', 'Needles sighed. “Zoe, there should be some papers near where you’re sitting. See if you can find the registration or something.”', 'There was a clear plastic folder with papers in it in the glove compartment, or whatever it’s called in a boat. The papers were in Arabic. Needles stopped the boat and took them from me, leaning over to read in the faint yellow glow from the battery compartment light. None of us had a torch, a flashlight.', 'Needles whistled through his baleen teeth. It’s quite a sound.', '“Okay,” Needles said. “When we get to shore I’ll do the talking. Pretend you don’t understand a word I’m saying.”', 'I remembered a little Arabic from my time in Jerusalem. Croyd? He might or might not speak it. ', ', Needles meant. Right. Got it.', 'The baby began to fuss. Croyd passed him back to me. “I can’t,” he said.', '“What?”', '“I’m sorry. I can’t do this. Rima knew I couldn’t do this, but you… I’m sorry.” He looked at Needles and me, took one last look at the baby, then rolled over the side of the boat, into the water.', '“Croyd!” I yelled. Needles kept driving the boat. As if he had expected this.', 'I wasn’t worried that Croyd would get hurt, or that he wouldn’t be okay. Croyd was always okay. But if there is one thing Croyd Crenson can’t ever be, it’s a father. He can’t stay in one place. He can’t hold a job. Some of the jokers he’s been are monsters who could not in any way cook a meal, hold a child, even throw a ball to a kid or catch one with whatever flippers or tentacles that version of him happens to have. And Croyd has to be on the run from time to time. He’s good at hiding when he has to, and sometimes no one knows where to find him.', '“We can do this,” Needles said. “It’ll be fine.” Last time I saw him he’d been a teenager. Now here he was, taking charge. Taking care of us.', 'I let the baby suck on my knuckle. He had a strong suck and that surprised me. He seemed really hungry. I thought babies needed to get calories every couple of hours or they’d starve. He’d die, too, like his mother. I’d never felt more helpless.', 'Jorah fell asleep again.', 'Newborns really don’t need to eat for the first twenty-four hours. I didn’t know that then.', 'Needles steered the boat up to the weathered boards of a slip. Strobing torches blinded us, and uniformed men with guns stood on the jetty. They looked as big as giants, looming above us. The charred remains of a town lined the shore. A breeze came off the salt harbor and kept most of the stink of destruction to the land side of us.', 'I was suddenly glad we’d left Rima’s body at the hut.', 'It’s been eleven years since Needles climbed out on that sagging pier to a face off with the local authorities. I huddled in the boat with Jorah inside my jacket. Needles didn’t outrank Magdi Shenouda, the Alexandrian official on the dock, but he could match him in rapid and adversarial chatter mingled with effusive praise and many honorifics. There was much shouting. Needles pointed to the boat. More discussion. They walked a few steps away and then Needles came back and reached down to help me out of the boat.', '“He wants to see the baby,” Needles said.', 'As ordered, I climbed out and got the baby out of my jacket.', '“It’s a boy,” Needles said. “Unwrap him, Zoe.”', 'It had stopped raining. Shenouda stepped closer while I demonstrated Jorah’s undoubted boy-ness to the cold wet air. Jorah squirmed and gave an outraged yell or two. Shenouda smiled and chucked Jorah under the chin. I wrapped Jorah up again.', 'I saw a wad of cash pass from Needle’s spiny hand to Shenouda’s. Then it disappeared.', '“Congratulations on the birth of your son, madame,” Magdi Shenouda said. “I fear there will be no papers regarding the kind return of my friend’s stolen speedboat or your accouchement. The chaos of war. I’m sure you understand.”', 'I don’t know how things would have gone if the baby had been a girl. Or a joker. No matter. Jorah Harris is a de facto French citizen because Magdi Shenouda was a decent man. They do exist. Another factor in our survival may have been that if there was one thing he didn’t need that morning, it was more bodies to deal with.', 'There were body bags lined up on the beach. I’m sure Rima’s body became one of them, eventually, but I’ve never heard about it.', 'After that, Needles somehow found us an ancient farm truck, and drove us out of the war zone.', '“Needles, where did you get that money?”', 'The truck rattled, its decrepit engine thunking along. “Croyd gave it to me. It’s like he knew. He knew, Zoe.” Crying, Needles wiped his nose on the shoulder of his shirt. “There’s enough to get you to… well. To wherever. Both of you.” He nodded to the baby in my arms. Jorah.', 'They never even asked. They just knew I would take care of him.', 'Not every memory is ugly. The fields of Egypt are tended and lovely and flat, and the sunrise that morning was beautiful, pinks and purples and touches of gold burning away the mist. A falcon, the sign of Ra-Horus returning with light and life, flew by on his way to the waking lake.', '“France,” I said. “We’ll go to France.”', 'The mythology is that ten good men are required to keep the world from destruction. I had a second chance. I had survived madness. I wanted to do more. I wanted to get ten people out of living hell and into a place where they could live and thrive.', 'I wanted to raise Jorah to be a good man.', 'It took years. I got a little start-up business going with Croyd’s money. I hired locals in the first years and made them part of the business. They got a share of the profits. Greed is a great motivator. When Zephyr became known as a good place to work, I went looking for my special ten, nats and jokers with talent and the ability to work and histories that read like horror porn. A half-Asian woman and her husband, who had built and owned a rice-paper factory in Free Vietnam before Tom Weathers went totally psychotic and left for Africa. A former lay sister and her bastard son, driven out of Tanzania. Her brothers later became child soldiers and then, very soon, dead child soldiers. An attorney from Nairobi, who was born in some unpronounceable hamlet on the Congo before it became a river of death. My dear Tarek—you met him when you arrived. You know he has a degree in chemical engineering? Gadi, his wife. Amanda Ann, always both names, from N’allins, US of A. She has a lovely drawl. Mateus and Victor, a couple from Brazil.', 'And I have a son.', 'Croyd does what he can. He sends money when he has some. He comes from time to time, to Zephyr, to see his son. Jorah knows who his father is, and that he can’t be here very often. I think he knows more about Croyd than he’s willing to tell me yet, because Google. They seem to have a bond, Croyd and Jorah, when they get together, and the different versions don’t seem to bother my son at all.', 'I don’t know if Croyd looked like Jorah at any point in his life, but the boy Croyd may have looked something like this before the virus changed him for the first time. There’s something about Jorah’s voice… Their voices are similar in some ways, and there’s something silky and dark in Croyd’s voice that seems to hold through the transformations he goes through.', 'I’m a murderer and a fool. I regret many things. I fell in love once, and I don’t regret that. While my son lives, I will keep on living. That’s all I can promise myself, ever.', '\\xa0', 'Jonathan Tipton-Clarke sat for a moment, trying to take it in, playing it as a movie in his mind—it would make a pretty good movie. He might even suggest to Zoe Harris that she write a memoir of the whole thing. If, you know, her life story weren’t tied to the Twisted Fists and littered with bodies. If she didn’t have a kid to take care of.', 'And Croyd Crenson’s son. As Harris had said, the Sleeper was great at hiding. There were a lot of people who wanted him dead, who might settle for hurting his kid.', '“I—I can’t publish this story,” he said. “That’s why you told it to me. You knew I wouldn’t jump on it.”', 'Smiling serenely, she glanced down at the surface of her desk, her hands flattened on it. Contemplating the blood on them, maybe. Or maybe admiring how clean they looked these days.', '“Was it enough?” he asked. He might not be able to publish the story, but he was still going to push. In fact, not publishing the story gave him even more reason to push. “Has all of this been enough to clear the slate? To get yourself some of that redemption?”', '“That’s not for me to decide,” she said softly.', '“And… where is Jorah now?” he asked.', '“He’s at school. I’m sorry you won’t get to meet him.”', 'He didn’t think she was sorry at all. In fact, he was pretty sure she’d planned this to keep the reprobate journalist away from her kid.', 'She moved the mouse, tapped a couple of commands, and then turned the monitor around to show him a snapshot. She had it set as her computer’s desktop image: Zoe Harris, mid-laugh, hugging a child of eleven or twelve, a boy in a school uniform, sweater vest and charcoal trousers. He was also laughing, hugging her back with gangly pre-adolescent limbs. Jonathan guessed that Jorah more resembled his mother: He had thick dark hair in an untamed flop over his forehead, light brown skin and fine features. No one knew what Croyd Crenson really looked like. Probably not even Croyd himself. But hey, there was a project—Croyd had grown up in New York City. There had to be a school picture somewhere. Maybe he could find it. Send it along to Zoe and Jorah.', '“Nice kid,” Jonathan said, and meant it.', '“Thank you.” The woman in the picture seemed completely different than the poised, precise executive sitting in front of him. He suspected Jorah was really the only person who ever got to see the other Zoe Harris. “Well, Mr. Tipton-Clarke, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time.”', 'And there it was, the pointed exit. The part of the script where he walked out the door and tried to figure out what to do with this secret he’d been given.', 'Nothing. He’d do nothing with it.', '“Thank you for your time, Ms. Harris.”', 'She still didn’t offer a hand for shaking. “I’m sorry you came all this way and won’t have anything to show for it.”', '“No, you’re not. But hey, I got to spend a week in the south of France.”', '“I’ll have Tarek show you out.” She reached for a phone, presumably to call the man.

How about I interview Tarek about what it’s like to have a degree in chemical engineering and work at a perfume lab.” He’d get his puff piece, dammit. “A guy who benefited from the generosity of a good person.”', 'Ms. Harris smiled. “I would read that story, Mr. Tipton-Clarke.”', '“Long is the Way” copyright © 2019 by Carrie Vaughn and Sage Walker', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by John Picacio']}\n"

They warned me when I started that one day I’d be tired of this, and I thought they were ranting and raving the way hidebound old fools always rant and rave when there’s a scientific advancement at hand—it’s as much a part of the process as the grandiose declarations of showing them, showing them all, and the ceremonial passing of the adventurer’s compass. Turns out they were right. There are only so many wonders you can see before you start thinking longingly of your own bed in your own room in your own home, of the pillows battered into the shape of your head, the mattress that knows every curve of your body better than a lover ever could, the heater that rattles in that way that turned into white noise years ago, unremarkable, soothing, memorable only in its absence.', 'I don’t think I’ve had a decent night’s sleep in five years, and I still have two more to go, and I hate this.', '“Helm, report.”', 'My current helmsman is a green-skinned nymph from a parallel where the gods of the Greeks never faded from power. Instead, they continued doing what they did best—fighting, fucking, and feasting—until ninety percent of the population could trace their lineage directly back to one god, demigod, or mythical figure or another. Not that they called them “myths,” since, y’know, when you’re one of the eleven million families whose Solstice dinners Zeus is required to drop in on, the situation isn’t very mythical anymore. She looks up, nods once, and goes back to studying her instruments.', '“Mammalian,” she says finally. “There are representatives of other populations, but they’re all at what we expect from the human-dominated Manhattans. The avian clusters match my pigeon data, and the insects match up with cockroaches. Mostly. There are a few outliers.”', '“Are the mammals moving slowly and with confidence, or are they cowering in the subway tunnels?” We once found a parallel where the pigeons had somehow turned carnivorous and bloodthirsty. A flock could pick the flesh off a human’s bones in under a minute, the piranhas of the sky.', 'We lost two interns on that stop, and we didn’t even manage to collect any of the flesh-ripper pigeons. Which is a much bigger pity. No one signs on as an intern for a trip like this one unless they have a massive death wish or a family that’s desperately in need of the survivor’s benefits. It’s sad and it’s tragic and it’s the reason we have such a high death toll every time we cruise the parallels. Everyone needs to get by. Flesh-ripper pigeons, though…', 'Those would have given the rest of us a reason to turn around and head for home, finally in possession of something bigger and better than the little trinkets we’ve been picking up since day one. Still, a hold of trinkets is nothing to sneer at. Stubby isn’t the biggest or fastest or shiniest airship in the fleet, but she gets the job done.', '“Mammals are within median human standards—this looks like a boring one—and they’re out on the streets in pretty large numbers. They seem to be alive, so we’re not dealing with a reanimating pathogen.”', '“Thank the Lightning for ', '” I say.', 'The rest of the bridge crew offer their own counterpoints, varied by their parallels of origin. The ones who’ve been with me since the beginning thank the Lightning, and the two we picked up in that weird theologically inverted parallel thank the Thunder, while Daphne—my helmsman—thanks her father, Zeus, in a bright, chipper voice that makes me thankful, once again, that we haven’t encountered him anywhere outside the parallel where we picked her up. The last thing I need right now is a randy deity showing up on my bridge, especially since he might not recognize Daphne as his daughter.', '“Captain?”', 'I turn. Our navigator is looking over his shoulder at me. Well. One of his heads is. The other is still watching the curved window that makes up the front of our airship, crystal clear and apparently fragile. Most people who attack us aim for that window first, not asking themselves how many protections we’d put on a sheet of glass that size. The fact that it’s not a solid mass of bugs doesn’t seem to be the clue it should.', '“What is it?”', 'He smiles uncertainly. “I think I see the Flatiron.”', 'That makes me stand a little straighter. Not every parallel has a Flatiron Building. Oh, every one we’ve discovered where the European colonists constructed a settlement in the area we know as “Manhattan” has had ', ' for a Flatiron Building, but they don’t always get built, and once they’re built, they don’t always survive. Some of them have burnt. Others were bombed. One of them was infected by an artificial bacterium intended to help destroy landfills by converting them into arable soil, which had converted it into the largest pile of loam I’d ever seen. An intact Flatiron is reason to celebrate.', 'Maybe. “How secure does the structure look?”', '“Seems stable.”', 'That’s… good. “Is there a docking station on the roof?”', '“Negative, captain.” Daphne looks up from her instruments. “The mammals below us are pointing and stopping as we pass overhead. I don’t think the airship caught on in this parallel.”', '“Oh, lovely. Primitives.”', '“There are flying machines,” says one of the other bridge crew. “They seem to operate on an internal combustion basis, but they get where they’re going. Fast, too. If we had one of those, we’d be home within the quarter.”', '“With our surveys half-finished,” I snap. “You can’t chart ground properly if you’re moving across it too fast for anything to record.

And trust me when I say there are things out there that are ', ' into the concept of devouring existence as we know it, one crunchy, nut-filled bite at a time. Worlds that aren’t watched have a tendency to blink into nothingness and be forgotten, filling the belly of some cosmic terror, creating yet another hole in the pastry. When a world gets eaten and a hole opens up, it’s easier for the baklava-eaters to shove their nasty little hands in and pry more pieces loose.', 'Maybe “your world is a tasty snack, good luck sleeping tonight” isn’t a good way to start a conversation, but I’m with the Cartography Corps, otherwise known as the Looters. Diplomacy is for people with a much higher pay grade than mine. Because…', 'Second, not every world knows they’re not alone, and better minds than mine figured out a long, long time ago that it’s best to let people figure things out in their own time. If one world opens a window on another, they view themselves as peaceful explorers. If a world has a window opened on it, they view the people on the other side as hostile invaders. Aren’t humans fun? I mean, to be fair, that sort of maps up to most of recorded history in the majority of the parallels we’ve charted, but still, it means we have to be careful when we’re surveying.', 'But it doesn’t mean we can stop.', 'The Cartography Corps is a joint venture by the governments of nine of the most advanced parallels. We have alliances with countless more. They send us resources, crewmen, and supplies, and we launch our airships into the vastness of the universe, charting and recording everything we encounter. We map the baklava, because we can’t tell when things are missing unless we know what’s supposed to be there. Despite my navigator’s fascination with internal combustion engines, they’re not suitable for our purposes: they go too fast, and our maps wind up with holes in them, empty places where the data ought to go. We travel by airship like civilized people, sailing across the endless sea of parallel worlds, making our lists and checking them twice, telling our archives who’s naughty or nice.', 'And of course there’s the looting. We’re not pirates, but we’re not saints either, and we’re almost always a long, long way from home, unless we find something that demands immediate attention from the scholars at the University. We gather trinkets and artifacts as we travel, along with raw materials, tucking them all away in our hold until we can’t carry any more and get to turn and head for home. We try never to take anything of specific social or religious significance. On parallels with a decently sized human population, we can sometimes even pay for what we abscond with.', 'Airship contact is inevitable, of course, but it’s never yet been a major concern. Some parallels fire on us, and that’s fine: if they don’t have the ability to move between layers of the baklava, they don’t have anything powerful enough to breach our shields. Other parallels try to worship us as gods, which is a little annoying for everyone except for Daphne, who takes it all in stride. Godhood is her family business, after all. Mostly people just give us what we ask for and try to forget us as quickly as possible.', 'Me and Stubby—my airship, Her Majesty’s ', '—have been running the North American mapping routes since I left home, and part of our job is to drop in, verify the location of semi-universal landmarks, and see whether they have any artifacts in need of preservation. Hence our current course for the Flatiron Building, which is, as I mentioned, close enough to universal as to be a little bit unnerving. Why that building? Why that location? No one really knows, but wow are there a lot of them.', 'The scouts and rangers of the incursion team are, as always, completely at ease when I step into their shared quarters, a single large room that takes up most of our lower deck. They have free access to our hold, and most of them have “borrowed” various artifacts to decorate the space around their beds, hammocks, and sleeping tanks. The effect is not unlike stepping into a junk shop that had an unfortunate encounter with a hand grenade.', 'Heloise is playing some sort of dice-adjacent game with Tim and Tom, using precious gems in place of the dice. Alcestis, from Daphne’s world, is face-down in a hammock, snoring gently. The rest of the incursion team is nowhere to be seen, which worries me a little.', '“Captain on the deck,” I call, voice pitched high and carrying.', 'They ignore me.', '“Captain on the deck ', '” I call, and they snap to attention, Heloise snatching a diamond out of the air as it bounces back up toward her, Tim and Tom turning to face me, Alcestis rolling out of her hammock and landing in a heap on the floor.', 'These are the people with whom I have been instructed to preserve reality. I used to wonder why cartography captains only ever seem to want a single tour of duty. I don’t wonder anymore. Now I wonder how much the professors are going to bribe me to keep my mouth shut when I get home. I better be getting tenure ', ' a letter from the queen granting me permission to raise the dead whenever I want to, or I’m going to single-handedly tank their enrollment numbers while I drink my way through every pub in New Amsterdam.', '“Hoy, Captain,” says Heloise. She’s always been the fastest to recover. She’s died twice, and undergone two field resurrections, and she’s still as cheerful as the day she enlisted. “What’s the signal?”', '“Human-occupied Manhattan, and we’re bound for a Flatiron Building,” I say. “We should be docking in no more than twenty minutes.”', 'Tim and Tom give a little cheer.

So exciting.', '“We don’t know local customs, pathogens, or linguistics, so the first team will consist of the four of you. Try to avoid contact with the government, or causing any branch of law enforcement to be activated. You’re going to go inside, scout around, see whether we can get anything out of this parallel, and give our mapping systems time to chart the city. When I call you back, you come. Got it?”', '“Yes, Captain,” they chorus dutifully. Anything to get off this ship and down into the city; anything to make them feel useful. They want to do the jobs they were recruited for. I can’t blame them for that. They have a tendency to cut a trail of chaos and confusion in their wake. I can blame them for ', ' and do, at every opportunity. But they’re the team I have, and replacements take time to train, assign, and arrive. Better to just work with what I have and hope they never cause a cross-parallel war.', 'Or that if they do, it’s a good one.', '“We won’t let you down, Captain,” says Heloise, and she’s wrong; I know she’s wrong. But that doesn’t seem important, so I just smile, nod, and wave her toward the door.', '\\xa0', 'The mapping systems have been running for the last hour, while the incursion team works their way deeper and deeper into the building, occasionally sending back brief transmissions that only Daphne understands. That means this is an English-dominant Manhattan: if we’d found another parallel where the Greeks conquered the world, they wouldn’t be using Greek as their semi-encoded messaging system.', 'Sometimes I think there must be a better way of doing this, or at least a more efficient one. Then I consider how many of our systems I can fix with a socket wrench and an electrical shock, and I remember why we do things in as primitive a manner as the job allows. The people on the ground can keep their bells and whistles. We’ll stay crude and we’ll stay in the air.', '“Uh, Captain?”', 'I turn. Daphne looks… concerned. The expression is foreign on her normally jovial face. A shiver of worry races down my spine and curls in my gut. If we’ve lost the incursion team…', 'We won’t be the first and we won’t be the last, and they all knew the risks when they signed on for this trip. See the parallel worlds, experience wonders beyond imagining, and possibly get consumed by them, that’s the gig. I know that. I’ve always known that. They wouldn’t even be the first crew members I’ve had to leave behind, laid to rest in the soil of an unfamiliar world. But every death burns, and I don’t want to go through this again, no matter how routine the risks.', '“Report,” I say.', '“Uh, Alcestis says you need to come down to the Flatiron Building,” says Daphne, slow, uncertain. Confused. “She says there’s some question of the trade arrangements we need, and the locals want to meet you.”', 'I blink. “What?”', '“Um, she also says the locals have offered to call security if you’d rather stay in the sky, since any real captain would come down and vouch for her crew.”', '“Lightning.” I close my eyes for a moment. The swear isn’t big enough. I need real profanity for this. “Lightning and ', '.”', 'The navigator makes a startled choking noise. I open my eyes.', '“Tell her I’ll be right down,” I say, and stride for the door to the release chute before anyone can argue with me or offer to take my place, to pretend to be captain while I sit safely in the sky, well away from mobs with pitchforks and torches. They risk themselves for me. The least I can do is return the favor.', 'The release chute is attached to the bottom of our ship, a clever construction of clear glass and metal bands forming an umbilicus tube that extends all the way to the roof of the Flatiron below. Aerodynamics have never been my field; I don’t understand how it harnesses the wind to slow our fall, or how it can tell the difference between a body it should drop and a body it should pull back into Stubby’s comfortable embrace. It does the job it was built for, and that’s enough for me. I step into the oval opening in the floor, and the wind catches me and pulls me down, like a drowning woman bound for the bottom of the sea.', 'But I’m not drowning. There’s air here, all around me, and through the glass walls of the chute, I can see this new Manhattan, familiar and strange at the same time, like something out of a very unsettling dream. Then the roof of the Flatiron Building is visible beneath me, and my incursion team standing around the vent structure for the building’s air supply. They’ve been joined by several people I don’t know. That’s… not excellent. We try to minimize interaction with the people native to the various parallels, for reasons ranging from “everyone has a different local flu” to “we find them vaguely unsettling.”', 'There’s nothing to be done for it now. I drop out of the chute onto the rooftop, straighten my jacket, and step forward, hand already extended for the polite, ceremonial confirmation that I’m not here to stab anyone. “Captain Isabelle Langford of Her Majesty’s ', ' at your service,” I say. “My crew said you wanted to speak with me?”', 'One of the locals, a cadaverous man who looks like he’s already been killed and resurrected three or four times—so maybe these people are more civilized than they seem—is practically vibrating, smiling so broadly that he’s in danger of splitting his lower lip. “This is really happening, this is really, really happening,” he says. He turns to another of the locals, a shorter woman with graying hair and a politely bemused expression. “You owe me ten dollars.”', '“I never made that bet,” says the woman. “Excuse me, ah, Captain, but are you saying these people really came from your, ah, airship up there? From another dimension?”', 'How much has the incursion team ', ' these people? “Yes,” I say stiffly, lowering my hand. “We come in peace. We don’t intend you any harm.”', '“Those two sentences mean the same thing, usually,” says the third local, a balding man who seems short next to the living cadaver, but is about the same height as most of the men in my crew. He has an Albian accent. It sounds weird here in a New Amsterdam cognate. He’s as out of place as we are. “Is there a reason you need to say both?”', '“Is there a reason you needed to talk to me?” I counter. “I don’t leave the ship very often.”', '“That was me,” says Alcestis, a twinkle in her eye that I don’t care for. “See, these nice folks thought we were fans who’d broken into their offices looking for one of their authors.” My confusion must show in my expression, because she grins and explains, “They publish fiction. Science fiction. Stories about airships and parallel dimensions and people from radically divergent timelines.”', '“Oh sweet Lightning, we fell into one of ', '” I mutter. I focus on our trio of locals, trying to smile, trying to look like I don’t want to push them all off the building and have done with it. “We can’t take you with us. Living samples are a violation of protocol.” I won’t tell them that we sometimes recruit new crewmembers from unexplored parallels. I don’t want the headache, and we don’t have any openings right now anyway.', '“We already clarified that with Al, here,” says the cadaver, indicating Alcestis. “We were just hoping you’d sit down for coffee, let us take some notes, while your people explore the city. We’re even willing to tell the authorities that your ship is a promotional stunt we’re doing. Keep the lookie-loos away.”', '“We’ll buy lunch,” says the woman. “For your whole crew.”', '“All right,” I say slowly. “Do you have green people on this parallel?”', '“No,” says the Albian man. “Why, do you?”', 'Slowly, I smile. Alcestis winks at me.', 'This is going to be fun.', '\\xa0', 'We set sail for the nearest dimensional instability, a map of our assigned territory safely stored in the ship’s systems and several cases of the local literature in the hold, along with everything else the incursion team was able to liberate during their tour of the city.

It’s not officially approved, but she looks good, and I like to let my. 2019 crew express themselves.', '“Sail for the tear,” I say. “We have work to do.” And on we go, chasing the horizon, steam and chrome and lightning, drifting onward, ever onward, any way the wind blows.', '“Any Way the Wind Blows” copyright © 2019 by Seanan McGuire.', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by Gregory Manchess.']}\n"

Reward and punishment. At its most basic, it’s a rat in a cage, pressing an operandum lever whenever a light goes green. He does it right, he gets food. He does it wrong, he gets electrocuted. The expectation of desire to eat the food or the fear of being electrocuted is unconditioned stimuli. But when the rat starts associating the lever or the green light with either expectation, that’s conditioned stimuli. We’ve taught him that. Made him think that. Made him expect that. We’ve rewired his brain.”', '“Right.” I can feel the teeth of his grin against my neck, his nose in my hair. “Kind of like me getting a hard-on every time I smell strawberries.

Ten micrometres. Zero point zero one of a millimetre.”', '“But what’s the point? I mean, what does a nanite want? What is a nanite scared of?”', 'I take in a breath that tightens his hold on me.', '“A nanite wants to learn. Same as anyone.

It doesn’t even matter. I’ve no reason not to believe it’ll be just like last time. We’ll be stuck here, the three of us, for at least another four months, pissed off or not.', 'My mother used to say that it was the journey that was important, and not the destination. I never thought she was right. But the suits from Astro Labs do. And I might be flattered by Mas’s interest in my research, but that’s only ego, my ridiculous need for him to see me. In reality, it’s all just busywork. No different to Don’s biotech experiments or Mas running his endless simulations. Our work is not the mission. The destination is not the mission. My mission. I’ve always known that. And after the last one, I swore no more. Never again. Yet here I am. Here Don is. Here we both are. Just the same. Again.', 'I know why. If the reward is big enough, wanted or needed enough, a rat will endure pain past the point of recovery. Of sense. And that’s obvious why too. All life, after all, is just pushing levers and hoping.', '\\xa0', 'It’s worse—so much worse—when he’s kind. Gentle. Tender. Tonight, Don brushes my hair with long, slow strokes until it feels as though I’m floating. His apologies drift around me like spring blossoms, cool and white. He talks about our wedding day: the ocean and big blue bowl of sky. The hydrangeas and pearl beads in my hair. How much his voice shook through the vows; how badly his skin itched. But it’s only when I cry that he smiles. That he kisses me. And I never know if he means what he says or if it’s just more cruelty.', 'I wait until he’s sleeping, and then I go out into the corridor, walk barefoot through the grass and bubbling springs. I stop outside Boris’s door, press my hot palms and forehead against its coolness.

Thanks.” I set the coffee down on the shelf beside the Skinner box.', 'Mas tries to kiss me, but I don’t let him. As much for his sake as mine. Since slingshotting around Jupiter, I’ve been trying to keep my own distance, my own counsel. I know he doesn’t like it, but when there aren’t many ways to avoid someone inside less than an acre, aloofness is about the only option. Maybe it’s because we’ve stolen enough of Jupiter’s velocity that it feels like we’re sprinting now instead of jogging, and I’m finding it harder to catch my breath. Maybe it’s because we’re that much nearer the end of the mission. Home looms larger, is ominously closer.', '“Don’t you have anything else you should be doing?”', 'Mas shrugs. “I’m running fuel calculations. Orbital mechanics simulations. Same as I do every other day.” He gives up trying to make me look at him, looks at the Skinner box instead.', '“Tell me about the harder stuff then. What the fuck you’re doing here. Why the fuck you’re doing it.”', '“Really?”', '“I’m in here every day, and I don’t really have much of a clue about any of it, and”— when he rubs his palm down my back, he does catch my gaze, and keeps hold of it—“I’m interested.”', 'We’re running out of time, is what he really means. To learn—to know—all there is to learn and know about each other. It’s exactly why I shouldn’t tell him.', '“You ', ' want to know about this?”', '“Sure.” He grins, holds up his hands. “Hey, look, I get that you’re the cognitive neuroscientist, and I’m just the guy in charge of the dilithium crystals. Use small words, and I’m sure I’ll pick it up.”', '“Sorry.” I smile. “Okay. So, the first paradigm shift in AI—” I laugh when he grimaces in mock terror, and it feels strange, alien, like it’s the first time I’ve done it in a very long time. Maybe it is.', '“The first paradigm shift in AI was designing deep learning architecture like neural networks. And the second was getting the neural network to design its own architectures without us.” I hit a key on the laptop to light up its screen. “So we now have a recurrent neural network, which is the controller; it proposes a new learning architecture for another neural network, the child network, to follow. The child network feeds back to the controller, which updates its decision-making process before delivering its next proposition. It’s basic behavioural psychology. Reinforcement learning: using feedback or reward for training purposes.', '“Reduction cells mean that a much smaller dataset can be used to design larger datasets, but any further progress has ground to a halt for years—there wasn’t much anyone could do without large-scale cluster management.”', '“Large-scale what?”', '“Really fucking big computers. Faster chips.”', '“And we don’t have them?”', '“Oh, someone does. Google, Nvidia, Intel, Graphcore, a whole bunch of folk. Probably even Astro. Just not me. I’ve got a laptop and a Skinner box.”', 'Mas moves closer. When his fingers brush against mine, I don’t move away. He peers into the Skinner box.', '“So these guys—”', '“The nanites.”', '“Right, the nanites. They’re the kids?”', '“The child network, right.”', '“Like mini-robots.”', '“Bots are just automated programs. They mostly replicate what we can already do, so we don’t have to do it.” I look at the pull of his shirt between his broad shoulders and only just manage not to press my palm against it. “Conventional bots are ones and zeros. Nanites are built from DNA.”', 'He turns. “That’s Don’s field.”', 'I step back. “Among other things.”', '“And this neural network allows them to learn?”', '“Sure. It’s the closest learning architecture to biological neural networks in humans. When you’re a baby, different regions of the brain connect to each other in a specific sequence, layer by layer, until the whole brain is mature. Deep learning neural networks do the same thing. It means the nanites can get progressively cleverer without task-specific programming.”', '“To do what?”', 'I shrug. “We’re already using nanotechnology as the silver bullet to fight cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We can program a swarm to find, target, and kill diseased cells. We’re starting to use scout swarms to identify them before they become diseased cells. But we could do so much more than that. We could link human brains to the cloud via nanites made of AI programs and DNA strands. We could stop ageing, stop illness, expand our neocortex ten thousand–fold.”', 'He gives me the crooked grin again. “But?”', '“The best we’ve managed so far are kludges.”', '“What the fuck are kludges?”', '“Workarounds. Clumsy, difficult to extend, impossible to maintain. The AI isn’t good enough yet. Hardware or software. Bio-evolution requires one-shot learning. Means no more massive, data-heavy learning algorithms, no more cluster analysis, no more us. An unsupervised machine learning model with a continuously learning AI program. When someone works out how to do that, that’ll be the singularity. Transhumanism.”', '“Transhumanism? All sounds a bit fucking Skynet to me.”', 'I smile. Pretend that I don’t feel sad and bad. Pretend that my goose bumps are only because of the press of his weight behind me, the stroke of his fingers against my skin, and not because he’s the first person to listen to me, to give any kind of shit about what I have to say, about what I think, since Boris. “That’s the plan.”', '“That’s what you’re trying to do?”', '“With a laptop and an old-school Skinner box?” I shake my head, dilute my sarcasm with a smile. “I’m more interested in the small stuff, the stuff that they always miss, don’t want to sweat; the whole Martians-being-killed-off-by-the-common-cold shtick. Faults, glitches, potential bugs. AI interfaces can be hacked, but I want to know if you can interrupt the deep learning sequence. If you can change it, corrupt it.” I look back into the Skinner box. “I want to know if you can do it through behavioural manipulation and conditional stimuli.”', '“And you can?”', 'I turn around, look at his eyes, the wide bridge of his nose, his lips, his teeth, his jawline. It’s a question he’s certain I will know the answer to. If not today, then one day. It makes my face grow hot. It makes my heart beat faster. It makes me want him to touch me. Even though I don’t want him to touch me. Even though I know he will anyway.', 'His palm moves against my face, his fingers push through my hair. “How was he last night?”', '“Fine.”', 'He presses his mouth to my temple, my cheekbone, that nearly gone bruise. “Fine is good.” He kisses me once, twice, the third time long enough that he and it are finally all that exist.', '“When do ', ' get my reward?” he whispers.', '“For what?”', 'I can feel his teeth against my skin. “For being in love with you.”', 'I want to feel it, to bask in it, but I can’t.

My module and the Skinner box. I don’t look at any of them any more than I do all those faceless locked white doors.', 'At the airlock, I stop. Key in my code over and over again until he comes up alongside me, smile intact.', '“Not quite yet,” he says. “Six minutes to landing.”', 'And it only then occurs to me that I must have lain on that bloody plastic bench for twenty-nine days.', 'I lean against the nanotube wall, count my breaths and listen to the fast streams and hot springs. Sink down onto the grass when my knees finally give out. Wait.', 'When I hear the exterior hiss and exhale of depressurisation, I scramble back onto my feet. Watch for the entry pad to turn green.', 'When it does, I key in my numbers again, step back as the mechanisms start vibrating, clunking, turning. “I want to see Mas.”', 'Smile. Shrug. “You won’t be seeing him again.”', '“Fuck you.”', 'I have never, ever managed to lose anything gracefully.', 'A breath of air. Its whisper. Promise.', 'He looks at me, squeezes my shoulders hard. “We’ll call you when we need you again. You behave, and we’ll set you up with the man—or woman—of your dreams next time.”', 'And then I really do want to pour a cocktail of nanites down his throat.', 'Instead, I push open the airlock.', 'Climb up out of my Skinner box.', 'I feel him watch me go. When I turn back around, he winks at me, reaches up for the hatch.', '“See you next simulation, Evie.”', 'And then I’m just standing in the middle of a desert of petrified wood and badlands. Cliffs and canyons of sandstone and limestone, painted with grey- and red-coloured bands like Jupiter’s angry atmosphere. Alone.', '\\xa0', 'It’s less of an oasis than a truck stop with no trucks. Except those that once a month restock the shitty little shack-shop with Coca-Cola and curly fries; the even shittier little lean-to bar with bad beer and peanuts.', 'The white barman has dreads and a Che Guevara T-shirt. He always listens to terrible reggae. An Astro suit perches on a barstool, drinks tomato juice, and does a bad job of pretending not to look at me. There is another, I know, inside the shop, pretending to shoot the shit with the till guy, who has no till. No bloody customers. I have been here so many times, and yet it never feels familiar. Never feels like a respite from either before or after.', 'I shift in my seat, trace the cool beads of sweat at the neck of my bottle of bad beer. I look at my watch. The SUV will come in another two hours. Will take me to a crap hotel in Tucson, where I will spend hours, days, weeks pretending to have fun. Shopping, swimming, shagging. Telling myself that the minute I think of somewhere else—somewhere better—to go, I’ll go.', 'When Mas yanks back the wicker chair opposite me and sits down, the Astro suit practically falls off his stool.', '“Are you okay?”', '“What?” I seize inside like a clock’s movement locking up: its wheels and pinion gears wound so tight it cannot move, cannot function. I try to stand up, my boots scrabbling for purchase on the hot rocky ground. “You’re not\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. What the fuck are you doing here?\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. I don’t—”', 'When he reaches for me with his big hands, I rear back, knock over my beer bottle. Watch it spin and fizz, because it’s something to look at other than him.', '“They told you.” His voice is flat.', 'And of course, I want to say, ', 'you', ' too badly to say anything at all.', '“How ', ' I tell you?” he says. And his eyes are so clear. “Baby, ', ' could I tell you?”', 'And maybe they are valid questions. I don’t know any more.', '“Evie,” he says, and moves just enough that he gives me momentary respite from the bright dry sun, places his cool hands over mine.', 'I’m no one’s baby. I’m not even anyone’s Evie. I’m like those nanites chasing through Don on a corrupted, manipulated program. I probably don’t even have a name. I’m probably a number. Just like a prisoner. A killer.', '“I’m a fucking cyborg.”', '“Jesus Christ.” He gets up, comes around the table, lifts me out of my chair like I’m a bag of groceries, and I’m too busy grabbing hold of him, too busy pressing every part of me against him to care. To think.', 'He holds me as I cry, as I choke, as I retch, as I forget and then remember how to breathe. He rubs my back, he kisses my hair, whispers apologies that aren’t cool and white like spring blossoms, but hot and fierce and furious like a funnelled vortex of fire and wind.', '“Here,” he whispers, when my grief finally runs out of fuel. I feel the sharp cool press of something metal against my palm. “Take this and go as far and as fast as you can.”', 'I go still. I become calm. I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth.

Smooth my free hand against his scalp, his big shoulder.', '“It’s a tracker,” he says against my skin.', 'I don’t doubt for a minute that I already have a tracker, embedded so deep in my code that I will never recognise it. But this. This is something I can throw away. This is something that at any time I can choose to throw away. Or keep.', 'Maybe it’s just more conditioned stimuli.

Now.”', '“I can’t. We can’t.”', '“We can.” His smile is brilliant. “We can do whatever we like.”', 'And it’s not the Astro suit at the bar, now speaking frantically into a satellite phone, that finally convinces me, it’s remembering that any animal or bird inside a Skinner box eventually resigns itself to the fate that’s already theirs.

      "{'Title': ['The Mongolian Wizard Stories', 'The New Prometheus'], 'Author': ['Michael Swanwick'], 'Body': ['A new story in the Mongolian Wizard universe.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The Arctic wastes stretched wide in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end. At their center, barely visible in the weak light provided by a sliver of sun at the horizon, was a rapidly moving sled. It was pulled by eight dogs with a single wolf at their lead, and ridden by a large man bundled in Sami furs.', 'Ritter welcomed the cold and hardship as an opportunity to test his manhood against Nature at its harshest. The scarf wrapped about his lower face was stiff with ice frozen from the moisture of his exhalations and what little of his skin was exposed to the air felt numb. When he bit off a mitten and pressed a hand over his eyebrows, the flesh beneath was warmed to life again and began to sting. The air was still and that, he had to admit, was good for it allowed Freki to follow the scent of their prey with ease.', 'He had pursued the half-man from Europe and was prepared to pursue him to the Pole if necessary. He was sure it would not be, however, for the traces of the homunculus’s passage had not been erased from the snows. Ritter was close on his trail.', 'A nub appeared on the horizon.', 'Ritter drew up the sled and, taking out a pair of binoculars superior to anything he could have imagined a year ago, studied the anomaly. Under magnification, it revealed itself to be a canvas tent that had been insulated by stacking up blocks of snow on all sides and piling more loose snow over its top.', 'Methodically, Ritter disentangled the sled dogs from the harness. Then he gave them a mental push to trot back a mile or so the way they had come and wait for him. If he died, his hold over the dogs would cease and then they must do their best to survive on their own. Ritter was not sure that they could. But at least they would have a chance.', 'He heaped snow over the sled, so that it looked like any other unimportant lump of landscape, then lay down behind it where he could not be seen. He was far from convinced such precautions were necessary. But he had underestimated the creature’s abilities in Helsinki and would not do so again.', 'Then he sent Freki ahead to serve as his ambassador.', 'The wolf loped across the snow and, upon reaching the tent, scrabbled at the canvas door. Then, when hands from within pushed it open, he rolled over on his back, exposing his stomach.', 'The homunculus looked down on the wolf and smiled. Kneeling, he stroked the animal’s underside and scratched it behind one ear. So far as Ritter could tell, he did not project his consciousness into Freki’s mind for even an instant. Nevertheless, the creature said aloud, “You are a diplomatic fellow, whoever you are. Come and talk to me. I promise no harm will come to you.”', 'Ritter stood, brushing off snow, and began the long trudge toward the tent.', '\\xa0', '“The safest thing would be to kill him on sight,” Sir Toby had said. He and Ritter were in his London office, a walnut-paneled room frowsty with cigar smoke and casual treachery.', '“I am no assassin. If murder is your intent, send a professional.”', '“So I did, three of them. This is no ordinary man. Indeed, by most accounts, he is hardly a man at all.”', 'In Ritter’s experience, when his superior emphasized the inhuman nature of an opponent, whether physical, mental, or moral, he intended actions such as no decent man would visit on a fellow member of human society. Scowling, he said, “How do you mean?”', '“He is a homunculus—an artificial man. There were reports—as reliable as such things can ever be—that the Mongolian Wizard had created a being with powers exceeding even his own. You will read them on your way to Helsinki. He is reputedly of great stature, inhumanly strong, and capable of wielding every known form of magic. For reasons yet unknown, this prodigy broke free of his creator and fled westward. There were several desperate attempts to recapture him. That caught our interest. Then his pursuers simply turned around and went home. Which by itself convinced me that such a being is too dangerous to be allowed loose in the world. While on the run, he somehow managed to acquire a great deal of wealth. Currently, he is using it to provision a ship. A schooner awaits you at the docks. If you leave immediately, you can intercept him before he departs for wherever he is bound.” Sir Toby fell silent. After a long pause, he said irritably, “Why are you still here?”', '“I’m not sure I understand what you expect of me.”', '“Use your own judgment. You have a certain…flexibility in these matters.”', 'Ritter had never before been accused of flexibility. He decided to receive the declaration as praise. Nevertheless, he said, “If I must kill him, I will. However, I require full autonomy in this affair. It is entirely possible I will end up letting this fellow remain alive and at large.”', 'Sir Toby sighed. “So be it.”', '\\xa0', '“I am prepared to offer you asylum,” Ritter said, “in exchange for what you know about the Mongolian Wizard. You will be given a modest stipend for as long as you need it, an apartment of your own, assistance in finding work, a new identity. By this time next year, you will be a citizen of London like any other.”', 'The homunculus laughed. “A grotesque like me?”', '“You are a little tall, perhaps. But not beyond the range of human possibility.”', '“It was you who shot at me at the docks, wasn’t it?”', '“I had no choice. You rebuffed my invitation to parlay and the ship was pulling out.” Watching the man’s eyes and seeing in them no trace of intemperance, Ritter decided to take a chance. “I hit you too. You grimaced, clutched your chest, and bent over. I am certain that I saw blood. But when you straightened again, it was gone.”', '“You hit my heart, yes. Any other man would have died then and there. But I did not. Would you like me to tell you why?”', '“It is my most fervent hope that you will.”', '“I was born by immaculate conception.” The homunculus was a handsome fellow, though his extreme height—he was a good eight feet tall—rendered even that alarming. He had given Ritter a barrel of salt pork for a chair and himself sat cross-legged on his sleeping pallet, putting their eyes on the same level. “Do you know how that works?”', '“I am afraid that I do not.”', '“It is a gruesome process. First the skeleton is assembled from the living bones of various animals. Human bones would not do, for it was desired to give me the features and physiognomy of a god. Bones taken from dead creatures would be…dead. So animals were required to suffer. It took a phalanx of surgical wizards just to keep the skeleton viable while muscles and cartilage were attached, nerves grown to interlace the flesh, organs coaxed into interaction, skin convinced to cover all…More magical talents were employed in my creation than for any other single purpose in human history. It is doubtful that anyone but my father—for so I consider him—could have arranged for such a thing. And even he had to effectively bring the war to a standstill to free up the resources necessary for it.”', '“I’m sorry—which war was this?”', '“The current one. Difficult though this may be for you to believe, I was created barely six months ago.” The homunculus proceeded to tell his tale.', '\\xa0', 'My earliest memories are of combat. Day after day, I was drilled to exhaustion in all the martial arts. My father I never saw. His place was taken by a weapons master, a pompous but capable Austrian named Netzke who taught me to fight with dagger, sword, pistol, rifle, and singlestick. Specialists were brought in to train me in fisticuffs and various other forms of bare-handed combat. Herr Waffenmeister Netzke worked me hard. At the time, I had the understanding of a child for I was mere weeks old, and it did not occur to me that I had any choice but to obey him.', 'At night, as I was falling asleep, I heard voices. At first, they were a soft murmuring, as of a not very distant sea. But day by day they grew louder and more insistent, as if they were saying something I needed to know but could not understand.', 'When I asked Netzke about the sounds and what they meant, instead of raising his fist to strike me as I’d more than half expected, he looked thoughtful. “They mean we must accelerate your training,” he said, and the very next day he brought in a wizard to tutor me in pyrokinetics—a much more likable fellow than Netzke by far, the Margrave von und zu Venusberg.', '\\xa0', 'A harsh cry involuntarily escaped Ritter’s lips.', '“I’m sorry, is the margrave someone you knew?”', '“He is my uncle. A most excellent man and one who disappeared when Bavaria was overrun. I can scarce believe he would betray his own country. I…No, pray continue. Forgive me for interrupting.”', 'The homunculus placed a hand on Ritter’s shoulder. “He would not have had any say in the matter. The Mongolian Wizard has ways of converting talented people to his cause. But allow me to return to my story and, though it is not a happy one, perhaps you will find some small measure of comfort in it.”', '\\xa0', 'It was the margrave who convinced Netzke that I was being overworked. “You are like the swordsmith who heats his creation red hot,” he said, “and then quenches it in oil, only to return it to the furnace again, back and forth, over and over, until the metal is so brittle it will break with the first blow struck in battle. Your charge has a brain—he must learn to use it as well as his brawn.”', 'Hearing the logic of those words, Netzke agreed, though reluctantly. So the margrave set out to teach me how to read. After the first hour of his ministrations, I grew impatient. “Explain to me the principles of this skill,” I demanded. And when he had done so, I astonished him by picking up the text he was using as an exemplar, Caesar’s ', ', and reading the first several pages aloud.', 'Thus, I gained access to my father’s library.', 'I was in Heaven. In short order, I read Milton’s ', ', Plutarch’s ', ', and, most sublime of all, ', '. From there, I went on to Rousseau and Kant and Locke and Descartes and Spinoza and Hobbes and, oh, so many more! I entered the library little more than an animal. Reading books made me human.', 'Perhaps it was coincidence, perhaps not. That evening something broke open within me. I realized that the sounds I heard were words, though neither spoken nor written. I was eavesdropping on the private thoughts of those around me: their fears, greeds, lusts, hatreds…It was not a pleasant experience. Much of this, I have since learned, came from my being in a nexus of worldly power, which necessarily drew to it, like flies to rotting meat, the worst exemplars of humankind. But even in the best of men there are dark thoughts and unwelcome fantasies. Had I lived in a monastery, the minds of the holy brothers would have been a torment to endure. And, having mastered literacy, my weapons training began anew. Only now, understanding—or so I thought—their intent, the exercises were repugnant to me.', 'At such a miserable time, your uncle was a godsend. In me, I think, he saw the mirror of his own unhappiness. We both despised our situations yet could see no way free of them. Young though I was, he spoke to me as if I were his equal, freely sharing his doubts and regrets. He was, as I am sure you know, a good man. From him I learned that to be human was not necessarily to be evil.', '“Sir?” I asked him once. “Why is the world in books so much better than the world in life?”', 'After a long, thoughtful silence, the margrave replied, “People often relate arguments they have had and claim to have said things they only thought of later. Novels are life lived as it should have been and factual works such as essays and history are thought laid out without the false starts, blind alleys, and easy assumptions we experience in the event. That’s all.”', '“I intend to think clearly the first time, and to live life without making mistakes.”', 'It was a callow thing to say, but the margrave only replied, “Well, perhaps you will be the first man to manage that trick. In any event, I encourage you to try.”', 'The margrave also taught me the rudiments of projecting fire with one’s thought, a skill I have since expanded far beyond anything he could ever have envisaged. As with reading, this skill opened new worlds to me. All forms of magic are but expressions of a single talent—I see you nodding, as if you had already suspected as much—limited only by the mental capacity of its possessor. Most people can wield this talent not at all. An elite class can, with training, master a single skill toward which they have a predisposition. And scattered here and there are a handful of extraordinary individuals who can master two or even three skills without being destroyed by them.', 'There are many such skills. In short order, I became the master of them all.', 'Word of my accomplishments spread swiftly through the court. We were housed in an ancient castle near the Russian border—by your expression, you know which one—whose windows had been bricked up and courtyards covered over to prevent men like yourself sending goshawks or the like to eavesdrop upon us. Though I more than once fancied I heard faint thoughts emanating from behind the wainscoting, which suggested you had spies diminutive enough to ride mice through small openings in the masonry. Be that as it may, the castle was a dark place.', 'So it was in a gloomy chamber insufficiently lit by whale-oil lamps that Netzke showed me off before a crowd of high-ranking officials. “This is our big day, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. Then he ran me through my paces. I bent iron at a distance, levitated, ran a dagger through my hand and then closed and healed the resulting wound, and made a dead rabbit hop and then, rising up on two legs, dance a gavotte. Finally, for the climax, Netzke commanded me to destroy a dummy tied to a cross at the far side of the room. Nothing could have been simpler. With a thought, I turned it to ashes—and burnt off the eyebrows of those who stood too close to the dummy, to boot.', 'The crowd broke into spontaneous applause. They were all smiles.', 'But I could read their dark, ambitious thoughts.', 'The Mongolian Wizard—even in his own court, he had no other name—was away on business of the Empire. But now Netzke announced that, my education being complete, he would be sent for and that within a fortnight, I would meet my father at last.', 'More applause.', 'I told you that animals had to be cruelly abused to create my frame. Only one animal could donate the materials that make up my four-lobed brain—the human animal. I had known this fact from very early on. My readings then made me aware of how vile a deed this was and, as a result, I was profoundly ashamed of my origins. Nevertheless, having more to think with than other mortals, and it more efficiently structured, I could perform prodigies of reasoning unknown to lesser men. All in a flash, I realized that my father had not had me created as a weapon, as I had previously assumed, but as a host for his identity. Using his own uncanny powers, he would oust me from my brain and assume my body as an ordinary man might don a new coat. The first such, moreover, of many he would assume in a lifetime that might well last a thousand years.', 'I stood transfixed with horror.', 'It was the worst of all possible times for Netzke to nudge me in the ribs and say, “You will sit at the right hand of your father—and then you will remember old friends, eh? What will you do for them then, eh? Eh?”', 'The evil burning within him was like a flame—dazzling. I had the power to reach out and turn it down low. May God forgive me, I did not. Instead, I said, “I will do ', ',” and quenched that flame entirely.', 'He fell to the ground, dead.', 'Everybody present—and they were among the most powerful men and women in the Empire—saw me do this. When I stalked off to my quarters to brood, not a one of them tried to stop me.', 'That night, the voices crashed in on me with unprecedented clarity—and all of them were focused exclusively upon me. Some courtiers simply feared my power. Others hoped to corrupt and then blackmail me or by elaborate lies to make me their ally and dupe. To kill me and place the blame on a rival. To convince another to kill me and afterward denounce him. To encourage my ambitions and become my most loyal and trusted lickspittle. In all the castle, there was but one soul whose thoughts were not violent and vicious. Half-maddened by this mental cacophony, and by the guilt I felt for the thoughtless and casual murder of the weapons master, I rose from my bed and dressed.', 'Then I went to the margrave’s room and knocked upon his door.', 'As I already knew from his thoughts, he was still awake. The margrave had been sitting with a glass of whiskey, thinking solemnly about suicide. On seeing me, he set aside the glass and said, “A moment ago, dear friend, I was thinking that there remained not one kindly face in all the world—and now, in an act of Providence, you appear to prove me wrong.”', 'I sank to my knees before the margrave and, taking his hands in mine, cried, “Sir, you must not entertain such evil thoughts as I see in your mind. The world is a dark place, but it would be darker still without your presence. I pray you, do not follow Werther’s path to self-destruction.”', 'The margrave looked surprised. Then he said, “I keep forgetting what a remarkable young fellow you are. So you can read my thoughts? I should not be surprised. But be comforted. Even that mode of escape is forbidden me. Willingly or not, I must be faithful to your father—and since he desires that I live, so I shall.”', '“Then we are returned to our eternal colloquy: Whether or not there is free will and, if there is, why it is denied to the likes of us.”', '“It can hardly be called eternal,” the margrave said with a touch of amusement, “for we have only known each other for a month. But, yes, we have had this discussion before.”', 'Caught in a turmoil of emotions such as would require a Goethe to describe, I blurted out, “Tell me. If you were free from all restraints, what would you do?”', '“I would scour this castle with fire and kill all within it,” the Margrave said. “Present company excepted, of course.”', '“And if that were denied you? What would be your second choice?”', 'Without hesitation, the margrave replied, “Oblivion.”', 'My heart sank. I could see his thoughts and knew that my mentor spoke only the simple truth. Wise though he was, the old man was blind to all possibilities save those he had been brought up to esteem. “Alas,” I said, “I had hoped for a different answer.” But respecting the margrave as I did—and, remember, his was the only moral authority I had ever known—I had, I felt, no choice.', 'Reaching into his mind, I freed him from my father’s control.', '\\xa0', 'The homunculus lapsed into silence.', 'After a time, Ritter said, “I’ve heard rumors of what ensued.” Which was a lie, for they had been formal reports. Then, truthfully, “I had no idea my uncle was involved.”', '“There were many wizards in my father’s court. So the margrave was, inevitably, as he knew he would be, killed. Not, however, before having his vengeance. For over an hour, he raged up and down the castle corridors. At the time I thought I had done the right thing. Yet it deprived my world of the only being I knew to be worthy of admiration. Even today, I wonder. Does freedom inevitably entail death? Freeing the margrave was the act of a young and inexperienced man. I regret it now.', '“I am sorry, Ritter.”', '“Don’t be,” Ritter said. “My uncle labored chiefly as a diplomat. But like all the men of my family, he was at heart a soldier. He died a warrior’s death. That is good to hear. What did you do next?”', '\\xa0', 'I fled, with the castle burning behind me. On my way out of the city, I encountered a Swedish merchant returning from Russia with a short wagon train of goods and bought passage with him (or, rather, put the memory of my having paid him in his mind) to Helsinki. He was a fat, ugly, vulgar little man—the first words he ever said to me were, “Pull my finger,” and he roared when I did—yet I found I liked him quite a lot, for he was utterly free of malice. He talked frequently of his wife, whom he sincerely loved, though that did not prevent him from frequenting brothels while he was on the road. Such a specimen was he! So different from the models of my reading.', 'Old Hannu was a merchant through and through. It was a kind of religion to him. He spoke often of its virtues: “Each man benefits,” he said. “Mark that! I buy lace in Rauma, to the enrichment of those who make it, sell it in St. Petersburg to shopkeepers who immediately double its price, and with the proceeds buy furs from Siberian trappers, who are grateful for my money. Both lace and furs multiply in value through the mere expedient of bringing them elsewhere. Midway between, I buy amber and silver jewelry to be sold in both directions. At every step, I make a profit, as do those I buy from and sell to.', '“People speak harshly of merchants because we drive a hard bargain. And it’s true I squeeze the buyers until they shit gold. Yet at the end of the day, everyone goes home satisfied. If there is a magic greater than this, I’m damned if I know of it. Did the Apostle Paul make half so many people happy as I have? Bugger me with a mule if he did.”', 'When I booked passage with Old Hannu, I had deemed it necessary to pay with fairy gold, for I was penniless and in desperate straits. Traveling with the merchant, however, I came to see that I had cheated this cheerful, awful, self-serving little man as he would never have cheated me. With a shock that was almost physical, I realized that, once again, I had sinned…For which I must atone.', 'So it was that the next time we came to a city, I accompanied Old Hannu to a tavern where women sold themselves. I did not partake in the pleasures of the flesh, however. Instead, I got into a card game with two professional cheats and a compulsive gambler.', 'I won everything the three men had. Two of them followed me out onto the street and in the shadows set upon me with cudgels. I could have broken their bodies. Instead, I placed in their minds an awareness of the precariousness of their position: that they were landless men outside the protection of the law, outnumbered and hated by the righteous and yet easy prey to men even more wicked than they. Then I set fire to their cudgels and watched them flee into the outer darkness. Perhaps they reformed their evil ways. If not, I am sure that they practice their illicit trade a great deal more circumspectly than before.', 'The compulsive gambler I trailed at a distance. He came to a church and, going in, climbed the long spiral stair to the top of the steeple. There, he gripped the stone balustrade with fear-whitened hands, building up his courage to throw himself over. He did not hear me coming up behind him. It gave him a start when I spoke, but that was all to the good. Returning half his money, I said, “You have learned a hard lesson tonight, my friend. Go home and never gamble again.” And I erased the compulsion from his mind.', 'Thus it went, step by step, for larger and smaller sums. In Lublin, I saved a dowager’s fortune from a venal lawyer and he was fined to pay for my efforts. While stopping at a farmhouse, I uncovered a buried Viking hoard, for which I accepted a modest finder’s fee. Sometimes my actions were legal and other times not. But every one of them ended with the other party better off than before. As Old Hannu would have put it, I gave good weight. And, bit by bit, I paid him back every pin of what I owed him.', 'Occasionally, men tried to kill me. I made them less murderous and sent them back to their masters.', '\\xa0', 'We came at last, after long and ordinary hardships, to Helsinki. Old Hannu brought me home to meet his family.', 'Doubtless, you will be nowhere near so dumbstruck as I was to learn that Old Hannu’s wife Leena was in no way the paragon of beauty and virtue he had made her out to be. She was, in her way, as ugly as he. Worse, as I was headed for the outhouse, she ambushed me, rubbing her body against mine in a manner no respectable housewife would. “I’m no beauty,” she said, “and I know it. But lie down with me and close your eyes and you’ll swear I’m as delightful as any of those Russian whores my husband won’t shut up about.” It would have made a dog laugh to see the convolutions I went through to evade her intentions.', 'Yet for all that, the love Leena and Old Hannu had for each other was genuine. I saw it in their glances, heard it in their speech, witnessed it in their deeds, and of course read it in their thoughts.', 'Further, they had a daughter.', 'Kaarina was as pious, virtuous, and chaste as Werther’s beloved Charlotte, and as beauteous as her father imagined her mother to be. I was smitten. When her parents invited me to stay on for a time, I did, just to be near her.', 'You will scarcely believe this, but Kaarina did not see me as hideous at all. Perhaps this was because her love for animals—she was forever rescuing kittens and fostering crippled dogs—caused her to see me not as a caricature of humanity but simply as one of God’s creatures. For a time, I was content merely being a part of her world, worshipping her from afar.', 'Then, one day in the garden, Kaarina invited me to sit down beside her. “You are always so silent,” she said. “When you first arrived, I thought you a mute. Tell me something of yourself.”', 'I needed no urging. All my thoughts, dreams, hopes, fears, loftiest aspirations, and meanest deeds came pouring out of me in a torrent of words. I shared my innermost self as I never had before nor ever would again, save right now with you, holding back only my feelings for Kaarina herself, lest she be alarmed by them. And when I was done…', 'Kaarina looked at me in blank bewilderment.', '“But none of this makes any sense,” she said. “A child born without a mother and grown to man’s estate in a matter of months. A nonpareil who teaches himself to read in an afternoon but kills his instructor on a whim. A redeemer of widows and gamblers who steals from an honest merchant. A master of all magics who has neither wealth nor position. A demigod who can read thoughts but suffers from doing so. How could such a living contradiction even exist? What place could he possibly find for himself in human society? You must clear your head of these dark fantasies and strive to be restored to your true self.”', 'Kaarina was not angry at me—her character was too refined for that. Nevertheless, her words cut through me like so many knives. I was her physical and intellectual superior and knew it. But our emotions are seated in the body and the body is an animal, even as the bear or the ass. In this regard I am in no way superior to any other man, nor will I ever be, however much my mental powers may increase.', 'My passion got the better of me.', '“But every word I spoke was true!” I cried and, throwing caution to the winds, added, “Furthermore…”', 'Seeing my distress, Kaarina took my great hand in her wee paws and said, “You may speak your mind freely, my friend. There is nothing you cannot tell me.”', '“Then I will say it—I love you.”', 'May you never see such a look on the face of a woman you esteem! Kaarina’s mouth fell open with astonishment and horror. There could be no mistaking the latter emotion, for I saw it burning in her thoughts like a flare.', 'I flushed red with humiliation. My blood surged and my hands clenched with the desire to strike Kaarina, to hurt her, to punish her for not loving me. It lasted only a single horrifying instant. Then, overcome with confusion and remorse, I fled. Kaarina, I am sure, prayed for my welfare and the rapid recovery of my wits. As if that would help!', 'That night, lying abed in the guest room (with the dresser pushed against the door, in case Leena again decided to make an assault upon my virtue), I thought over everything I had gone through and learned since coming to Helsinki. It had just been forcibly demonstrated that there could be no future for Kaarina and me. I needed love, not pity! And she…needed someone she could understand. My feelings for her were undiminished. But, alas, there could be no true communion of thought between us. The imbalance of intellect was simply too great.', 'It was a painful process working this out while the thoughts of the city roared and crashed over me like a mighty surf. But I came at last to two conclusions. First, that I could not stay in this house a day longer. Second, that in order to adequately think through my life and purpose, I must somehow isolate myself completely from humanity.', 'In the morning, profusely thanking Old Hannu for his hospitality, I left. Then I set about outfitting an expedition to the unknown Arctic regions. Out of respect for the values of the man I considered the second great mentor of my life, I earned the tremendous sum this required by honest means.', 'Which was why you almost caught up with me before my ship sailed.', '\\xa0', 'As the ship left the harbor, the eternal pandemonium of thoughts faded and I had to endure only those of the ', '’s officers and crew. I wept with relief. So you can imagine with what ecstasy I beheld the icy shores of this desolate land. And when the ship sailed off, carrying away with it the last trace of any thought other than my own, I experienced a sensation of pure bliss. Oh, blessed silence! I fell to my knees to thank whatever gods may be for that wondrous gift. Then, carrying all my supplies on my back, I walked inland until I judged myself safe from the influence of any passing ship. There I sat down and proceeded to think. To think, and to plan.', 'My first conclusion was that I needed a mate—one every bit as beautiful and virtuous as Kaarina but also as intelligent and strong of body as I. There being no such woman, I would have to create her myself. Which would be no easy task. To build such a goddess would require the use of many wizards, the sacrifice of numerous animals and women, and a fortune in related materials. Vast wealth would be required. Further, since such a project could not possibly be kept secret, it would demand defenses: an army, a secure territory with fortified borders, and a system of secret police to protect me from spies and saboteurs. In short, it would entail exactly such an empire as my father is currently endeavoring to create. For a moment, I was aghast at the thought of what atrocities I would have to perform.', 'Then I resolved to do it. My mate and I would wed and have children who would have children in their turn and their descendants would inevitably supplant the human race. All the world would be theirs and I their Adam.', 'You blanch, Ritter. Be reassured. My resolution lasted but a moment. For I then reflected that to carry out my plan would be to expose a woman I hoped to love with unswerving dedication to the pain of hearing the thoughts of Mankind which had almost driven me mad. Yes, I could immediately upon her creation put to death all those involved, before her capacity to hear their thoughts came into focus and then carry her off to some desolate tract such as this. But what would happen when she could read ', ' thoughts? When she understood what crimes I had committed in her not-so-immaculate conception?', 'Logic, alas, told me that the project was doomed to fail.', 'Thus: No wife, no offspring, no hope, no future.', 'I had just determined what course of action I should take when I sensed your approach. It occurred to me then that it would be pleasant to share the tale of my life with a sympathetic soul. From what I could sense of your character, it seemed to me that you might well understand my story.', 'So I let you approach.', '\\xa0', 'For a long time, the homunculus did not speak. Ritter, who was comfortable with silence, waited. At last his host said, “Have you ever considered beetles, Ritter?”', '“Beetles,” Ritter said flatly. “No, not since I was a boy.”', '“They are, I assure you, fascinating creatures and well worthy of your respect. But they cannot provide much in the way of companionship.” The homunculus stood. “On which note, the time has come to put an end to our colloquy.”', 'Ritter tried to stand and discovered that he could not. Nor could he move so much as a finger though his lungs, for a mercy, continued to pump air.', 'The creature looked down on him with an expression of gentle pity. “You are not a good man, Ritter. How could you be, given your occupation? However, you are not as bad a man as you fear you might be—not yet, at any rate.” He went outside, leaving the tent flap open behind him. Over his shoulder, he said, “Imperfect though you are, I wish you well. I wish every single one of you well. But I cannot bear to live among you.”', 'The homunculus walked steadily away from the tent, toward a distant ridge. When sufficient time had elapsed, he passed over the ridge and out of sight. All the while, Ritter strove in vain to cast off his paralysis. Nor could he enter Freki’s mind—that ability too, it seemed, had been frozen.', 'Then the sun came up.', 'There was a tremendous light, at which Ritter discovered himself capable of movement again, for he automatically turned away from it and threw up an arm to protect his eyes. Almost immediately, there followed a sound so thunderous that he clapped his hands over his ears to reduce it to a roar.', 'Ritter burst from the tent.', 'Running with all his might, Freki at his heels, he came to the top of the ridge over which the creature had disappeared. Below him Ritter saw a crater half-blasted and half-melted into the ice with a smudge of black at its center, as if a god had reached down from the sky to brush a dirty fingertip against the snow.', '\\xa0', 'When Ritter had done making his report, Sir Toby said, “It is a pity you could not win him over to our cause.”', '“In his estimation, our cause was not a good one. I do not believe that the creature saw very much difference between our side and his father’s.”', 'A darkness congealed within Sir Toby then, as if there were a thunderhead filling his skull and threatening to burst through it with gales and lightning. But he only said, “And who was he to pass judgment on us? The ugly brute!”', '“No. He was a handsome man, very much so. By any reasonable definition, he was extremely well made.” Ritter shook his head sadly. “Yet in his own eyes, he was monstrous.”', '\\xa0', '“The New Prometheus” copyright © 2019 by Michael Swanwick.', '\\nArtwork copyright © 2019 by Gregory Manchess.']}\n"

She unwedged a water bottle from the side of her pack. “And so foul-mouthed.” Elizabeth had talked most of the way up the mountain. May was pretending she didn’t mind.', 'Birds muttered in the trees. Piper plodded back from looking over the ravine’s embankment to where the river pounded below. “I’m done walking,” she said. She dropped her bag and flopped to the ground. “This is a stupid hobby. Don’t tell Ailey.”', '“Flowers.” Elizabeth pointed to the daisy Piper was tucking into her hair. “Flowers are actually fancy, colorful penises. I mean, how weird is it that we smell them? On purpose?”', 'Piper scrunched her face and let the flower fall from her hand. “You’re messed up.”', '“Nature is evil,” Elizabeth said. “It’s not my fault.”', '“Nature is not evil,” May said. She soaked a bandana with her water bottle. “Nature is nature. Evil is just a story.”', '“Duck rape,” Elizabeth said. “Ducks rape other ducks all the time. That’s not evil?”', '“Oh my god,” Piper said, “this is the worst conversation. I don’t want to know any of this stuff. Can we have the trees and flowers and nature and whatever without the ruining-it-all part? And also no more walking?”', 'May wrapped the wet bandana around her neck. “We have to sleep in these woods tonight, Elizabeth. Under all your penises.” The other girls were pink with exertion and sun, but May’s skin didn’t pinken adorably. She was dark, unfreckled, and felt slimy with perspiration. She wondered how the white girls stayed looking so pert.', '“Don’t even get me started on fruit.”', '“Nobody said fruit,” May said. “We aren’t getting you started.”', '“Oh my god, don’t,” Piper said.', 'Ailey traipsed down from a rise, GPS held talismanically before her. “Guys,” she called.', '“Here we go,” Piper said. “Anyone else on my side? No more walking?”', 'May shrugged and sank to the ground next to Piper.', '“It’s weird,” Ailey said, trotting down the slope to them. “We aren’t where I thought we were.” She studied the GPS’s minuscule screen, then looked up as though the forest might offer advice.', '“It’s pretty here,” Piper said. “I bet it’s a good place to camp.” She raised her eyebrows at May.', '“Yeah,” May said obediently. It ', ' pretty. The undergrowth was leafless, sparse, dry twigs and branches hatching together and turning the forest hazy. Ancient cedars pillared into the sky. There was something awful, May thought, awful in the original sense of the word, about looking up. Something about the stature and the patience of the old trees made her feel small, just one story in an endless cycle of nearly identical, pointless stories.', '“I thought we’d go upriver,” Ailey said, fiddling with the GPS. “There’s a peak pretty close. Seriously, this thing is being weird.”', ', Piper mouthed at May, eyes wide with horror.', 'Elizabeth approached the ravine’s edge. She held on to a sapling to lean out over the void.

We’re in the right place. We found the river. We know how to get back.” She gestured at the other girls. “Let’s go.”', 'Elizabeth scrambled a few steps down toward the river. Piper and May exchanged dubious glances.', '“Why not camp here?” Piper said.', 'Ailey stared. “We’re almost there.” She crossed her arms.', 'Ailey was in the Mountaineers. Ailey was In Charge.', '“Almost where?” Elizabeth called from her perch over the river. “We’re in the middle of nowhere. That part of the middle of nowhere is probably not much different from this part.” Something loosed under her shoe and she slipped, cursed. The sapling bent but held.', 'Elizabeth was Ailey’s best friend from high school. Elizabeth had provided a running commentary all day of potential disaster, mishap, and urban legend seemingly designed to prevent any possibility of peace.', 'Piper, Elizabeth’s current roommate, had taken responsibility for\\xa0 worrying about snakes, worrying about voiding her bowels outdoors, and worrying about potential overlap between the two. Piper had shown up at Ailey’s apartment that morning wearing Converse sneakers. Ailey made her buy boots at a Wal-Mart on the way out of the city.', 'May wasn’t sure why she’d been invited. She liked Ailey. They’d met at a mutual TA’s awful kegger. The TA was drunk and getting creepy, and May had noticed and dragged Ailey away for a made-up emergency that required both of them to hide in the downstairs bathroom and then leave out the window. They’d been lab partners the following semester. Ailey had told the story about the window escape on the morning’s long drive, and made it seem like something they’d done for fun. Like a joke or something. Maybe only May had noticed the TA’s weird intensity, how he had cornered Ailey in his cheerless, abandoned dining room with a hard, intentional look. Maybe May’s compulsion to push the dining room door all the way open and rescue Ailey had been misguided. Maybe Ailey really did think the two of them had snuck out of the party because why not? Anyway, they hadn’t exactly been besties or anything. Only the shared, strange night, and then a semester sharing a lab bench.', 'Maybe May was just there for color.', 'Nobody except Ailey had ever been backpacking before. But probably they’d all be fine.', 'Eventually Ailey capitulated and they pitched two tents in a ring of enormous cedars. Elizabeth stretched her arms toward their crowns. “Nature’s glorious phalluses.”', '“You have dick on the brain,” Ailey said. “Go find firewood.”', 'Piper spread out on the ground between the two tents. “My tummy hurts,” she said.', 'May and Elizabeth dragged armloads of sticks into camp and Ailey sorted the pile, snapping branches against her knee. The sun hadn’t begun to set, but their little camp in the trees was dusky and cool. There was plenty of firewood, so they started a fire early. The river noise mortared the empty space between the trees.', '“We should tell scary stories,” Elizabeth said.', '“No we should not.” Piper lay next to the fire, head on her pack. “We definitely should not do that.”', '“You’re right.” Elizabeth eyed the sky. “We’ll wait till dark.”', '“Also nope.”', '“Okay, what about, like, creepy stories?”', 'May unlaced her boots. God, it felt good. “Aren’t scary stories a requirement when you’re camping?”', '“They are not,” Piper said. “There’s no requirement.”', 'Ailey patted Piper’s shoulder. “Okay, the rule is: If Piper says stop you have to stop.”', '“No means no,” said Elizabeth.', '“I already said no,” said Piper. “No clearly does not mean anything to you assholes.”', '“Oh come on, Pip,” Elizabeth said. “We’ll be nice.”', '“What I do,” Ailey said, “is I figure out why the story can’t happen to me. Like, the Babadook doesn’t live in my basement because both my parents are alive. See? You neutralize it. You can basically always find a reason why you’re okay.”', 'Piper crossed her arms over her chest, an angry sorority sarcophagus. “I’m covering my ears.” She made no move to do it.', 'There was a pause to allow Piper’s disapproval to smoke away. A breeze clattered long fingers of underbrush, a quiet ', ' over the river’s constant rumble. Overhead, high in the canopy, leaves hissed.', '“So, I heard this story,” Elizabeth said, leaning forward. “About some kids out in the woods. They kept hearing—”', 'May groaned. “I saw that subreddit last week too. It was stupid. Why would a rapist hide in the woods? It doesn’t make any sense. If he’s looking for victims, he’d be better off\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. anywhere, pretty much. The internet is a liar.”', '“Just cause it’s on the internet doesn’t mean it’s automatically untrue,” Ailey said. “It must come from somewhere.”', '“Yeah,” Elizabeth said, “like the girl who was playing the elevator game in that hotel in LA, and then they found her dead in the water tower. Like the game worked or something.”', '“Stupid stories,” May consoled Piper. “They’re just memes.”', '“You’re memes,” Piper said. “What does ‘meme’ even mean.”', '“Like, cultural ideas.”', 'Ailey scoffed and leaned back on her palms. “Every idea is a cultural idea.”', '“Memes are cat pictures,” Piper said.', '“They’re supposed to be an idea that, like, hits something primal. It’s important to people, somehow. Cat pictures or whatever,” said May.', '“So they’re basically just good ideas,” Ailey said. “That’s what you mean.”', '“Maybe it’s how we do mythology now,” May said.', 'Piper waved a hand at the canopy. “What is it about cat pictures? What’s the primal idea there? Cute cats?”', 'May sniffed and rolled her eyes. “I don’t pretend to understand white people.”', '“Ooh, reverse racism,” Elizabeth said. “Plus I know for a fact you liked those pictures I posted of my mom’s kitten, so.”', 'Piper groaned. “I think all the turkey jerky gave me gas.”', '“My condolences,” said Ailey to May, who was Piper’s tentmate.', 'They sat in the quiet, the rhythm of the river holding them.', '“So I saw this story,” Elizabeth said, and Piper groaned again. “No, no, it’s not scary. Not really. It’s just some legend. It seemed like it might have been made up, but I couldn’t tell, and I ended up doing a bunch of research.”', '“By research,” Ailey said, “do you mean going down a click-hole?”', '“That’s not research?”', '“I think it’s interesting,” May said, “how stories get changed around on the internet. People making up legends. Like Slender Man—people got obsessed with it, and that made it almost true. It didn’t matter that it wasn’t an old story. People got into it and that made it as real as, I don’t know, Santa or the Virgin Mary. It makes me think all stories are real at some point. There’s something that’s so compelling we have to tell the story over and over again. Like we’re trying to refine it.”', '“Right,” Elizabeth said. “Exactly. I wanted to know where this one came from. Have you heard of Stick Indians?”', '“That sounds racist,” Ailey said.', '“Stick Native Americans,” Piper said. A trace of sunlight flickered over her closed eyes.', '“They call it Stick Indians. I didn’t make it up.”', '“Repeating things doesn’t make them not racist,” May said. She hadn’t meant to say it so vehemently. She glanced around their circle to see if anyone had flinched, and relaxed her shoulders.', '“Okay, so,” Elizabeth said. “Someone posted this story—it was obviously a story, it had characters and a plot and whatever; real stories aren’t that well organized. A bunch of kids were out camping and were hassled by this tree monster. Whatever, it was dumb, but I hadn’t heard about Stick Indians before.”', 'Now Piper watched Elizabeth, interested. Ailey poked at the fire.', '“Anyway. I looked around and there wasn’t much info. A couple old websites with Yakama Indian legends, but all the sites had basically the same story, and you could tell it was copy-pasted. That first site I saw referenced some books I couldn’t find on Amazon, but I later I saw the same titles in a couple different places. Enough to make me think the books might at least be real.”', '“You could try a library,” Ailey said. “Like, where actual research is done.”', 'May snorted. “You’re such a snob. You just said like five minutes ago that the internet isn’t automatically false.”', '“I’m a tactile-experience snob,” Ailey said. “I like the real world. I don’t hate the internet.”', '“You definitely don’t hate Instagram,” Elizabeth said.', '“See? I don’t hate Insta.”', '“Aww,” Piper said, “she has a cute nickname for her BFF.”', '“My cousin has a dog named Hashtag,” Elizabeth said. “But guys: Stick Indians—that’s what the Yakama people say, apparently, so it’s not racist and don’t yell at me—they’re, like, leprechauns ', ' sasquatches ', ' fairies—”', '“Um, vague?” Ailey said.', 'Piper laughed. “They’re either huge or tiny, and they’re evil or maybe they’re good, so anywhere in there, go ahead and pick something.” She pressed a hand to her belly. “Ow.”', '“Fart it out,” Ailey said. “You’ll feel better.”', '“It’s not like I’m trying to keep it in over here.”', 'Elizabeth gave Piper the side-eye but kept talking. “Yeah, exactly, everything’s really vague about what they actually are. But the idea is they’re forest spirits who look like trees. Troublemakers. They fuck with travelers. They protect the places men shouldn’t enter.”', '“See,” Ailey said to Piper. “You’re safe. It’s only a problem for men. For once.”', '“Prostate cancer,” May said.', '“Dude, my uncle had prostate cancer and it was hella my aunt’s problem,” Ailey said. “She was exhausted all the time.”', '“Okay, you win.”', '“They have flutey voices and make whistles and snaps to try to lure people into the woods,” Elizabeth continued. “You aren’t supposed to whistle at night or the Stick Indians will get you.”', '“Huh,” May said. “That’s a Nigerian superstition too, I think. Same thing. Don’t whistle at night or the evil spirits blah-blah-blah.”', 'Elizabeth’s voice took on a storyteller quality, oracular. “At night, the Stick Indians creep up to people’s tents and push a stick through the flap and ', ' the people inside. Think about it: You’re sitting, it’s right before bed, you’re minding your own business, and all of a sudden this branch comes sliding into your house, all silent and slow, and just ', ' you.”', '“Are you seriously telling us a scary dick story right now?” May said. “Push a stick through a flap? For real?”', 'Piper rolled to her side and wheezed, giggling.', '“I’m starting to worry about you,” Ailey said.', '“No, no, it’s really fucking scary!” Elizabeth said. “Think about it! Like, dick or no, it’s creepy as fuck.” She waited until Piper stopped snorting, then continued. “Some of the legends say the Stick Indians guard the gate to the underworld. Or else they patrol the sacred parts of the forest, where nobody is supposed go.”', '“Oh, okay,” May said, “I know this story. ‘This is their space, not ours, beware.’ That sort of thing.”', 'Ailey said, “Lots of scary stories are like that. Humans encroaching on everything, ruining it all. Like everything belongs to us.”', '“Bullshit,” May said. Again, it came out more forcefully than she’d intended. She moderated her tone, didn’t want to be ', '. “I don’t like those kinds of stories. For a bunch of reasons. For one, I don’t think humans are evil by nature. We don’t ruin everything. We’re just animals doing what animals do. And for another, I can’t tell you how many times in the universe a black person was told that they couldn’t do a thing because it didn’t belong to them. Bullshit. It’s not race, it’s all humans. We belong in whatever environment we can get by in.”', '“Well, okay, good point,” Ailey said. “Like, where would we be without civil rights people saying fuck the whites-only nonsense. But I don’t think humans should be able to take whatever they can. We have an unfair advantage.”', '“What makes it unfair?” May said.', '“I don’t know. Intelligence? Tools?”', 'Elizabeth said, “Octopuses use tools but they don’t fuck up the ocean.”', '“I don’t know, then, but it’s something.”', '“Just because we can get by in a place,” May said, “doesn’t mean we should shit all over it. But I hate the idea of not being allowed. Who gets to decide? Usually it’s men.” She spread her arms. “And we’re doing fine here, aren’t we? How many dudes told you it wasn’t safe for a bunch of girls to go out into the woods alone?”', 'Piper laughed. “Uh, my boyfriend ', ' his roommate.”', '“My dad,” Elizabeth said. “Never mind that he’s known Ailey for years and she does this shit all the time.”', 'Ailey said, “The first time I went camping with a couple girls from Mountaineers, my mom was like, ‘You’re probably in more danger at a frat party than in the woods. Call me when you’re home.’”', '“So we’re agreed,” May said. “Telling people they can’t do something just because someone else thinks they shouldn’t is bullshit. And men suck.”', '“Dicks,” Elizabeth said.', 'Ailey lifted her water bottle in acknowledgement. “Dicks,” she agreed.', '\\xa0', 'May woke feeling like bees were swarming in her head She was so tired her face hurt. Something had woken her, and she tried to decide if she cared what it was.', '“Shit,” Ailey said, outside the tent.', 'Through her sleeping pad May felt the ground hard beneath her hip. Exhaustion squeezed her skull. Next to her, Piper finally slept.', 'Sticks clattered.', 'May rubbed her face, sighed. The sound of zippers—sleeping bag, then tent—grated against the quiet morning, the river-roar and muted ', ' of birds. The air outside was cool and thick with moisture. She paused to pull on her boots. The way blood rushed to her head when she finally stood made her irritable.', 'She squinted. “Who made the mess?”', 'Ailey had a handful of firewood. The rest of it was scattered over and around their campsite, an explosion of branches and twigs. It looked like a game of pick-up sticks for forest giants. Something must have hit their firewood pile hard to send it flying so dramatically.', 'Ailey looked pained. “The wind?” she said. “I don’t know.”', '“It didn’t seem windy,” May said. “I didn’t hear anything. I was up most of the night, so.”', 'Ailey lifted a forked, scaly branch from inside the stone ring of their firepit. “Trouble sleeping?”', '“Piper,” May said quietly. Ailey made an apologetic grimace.', 'The two of them gathered the scattered wood. It seemed like more than could possibly have been left over from the night before. The pile nearly reached May’s knees.', 'Piper rustled and groaned inside her tent. “She got up a lot,” May said to Ailey.', '“Shit. I hope she’s not too tired to hike.”', 'Piper looked fine, though disheveled, once she was sitting by the firepit. Ailey dismissed the idea of making a fire for breakfast—she’d brought a camp stove to heat water for coffee and oatmeal—but even the memory of fire was enough to draw them close. Without discussing it, Ailey and May had kept to themselves the strange disarray they’d woken to.', 'Piper took a cup of coffee and held it, not drinking. “I think I ate something weird,” she said. “I’m okay now, or better than last night, at least.”', '“I bet it was the diner yesterday morning,” Ailey said.', '“My money is on the entire pound of turkey jerky she ate,” May said.', '“Sweet, sweet sodium,” Piper said. “It’s my weakness, okay? I have a problem. But I learned my lesson. I’m clean now. Cold turkey.”', '“Boo, pun,” Ailey said. May hissed. Piper made a little bow.', '“Someone made a pun?” Elizabeth said from inside her closed tent. “Before breakfast? Jesus Christ almighty.”', '“Get up,” Ailey said, “There’s coffee.”', '“Coffee,” Elizabeth repeated, voice rough with lust.', 'Around the unlit fire they ate packet oatmeal and handfuls of dried fruit. Piper didn’t eat, just held her cup stared dozily into it.', '“I want to get going pretty quick,” Ailey said.', 'Piper wedged her full cup into the dirt. “Dammit,” she muttered. She scurried into the bushes, pulling a packet of tissue from one pocket as she disappeared.', 'Elizabeth watched her go, face scrunched. “What’s up?”', '“I think she’s sick,” May said.', '“Ooh. Bad luck.”', 'Ailey packed the cooking gear. When Piper came back, Ailey said, “Are you going to be okay?”', 'Piper flopped to the ground. “I dunno. Yesterday I was like, I’ve never pooped in the woods, this is going to be such a new and exciting and terrible thing, I wonder if I’ll be able to even do it. And now pooping in the woods is like”—she gestured absently—“oh, that again? I’m a pro.”', '“Do you feel okay? Can you hike?”', 'Piper closed her eyes. The morning sun through the trees dappled her shoulders. “I’m so tired.”', '“Should we go back?” Ailey said. Her voice was tight.', 'Piper shook her head without opening her eyes. “I’ll just stay here,” she said. “Forever.”', 'They were all quiet for a moment. May felt everyone else’s tension in her own skin. “What about,” she suggested, “if we hike around today and come back here tonight to camp?”', 'Ailey’s jaw was set. It was clear—anyone who knew her would know—that she didn’t want to deviate from the plan. But Piper looked miserable. May couldn’t imagine forcing her to keep going.', '“At least we wouldn’t have to go home early,” Elizabeth said quietly, to Ailey.', '“And hey,” May added, “we can leave our tents and crap with Piper, so we won’t have to carry as much.”', '“Base camp,” Elizabeth said.', '“I like that idea,” Piper said. “I like the idea of not moving.”', 'Ailey looked thoughtful.', '“Wait.” Piper opened her eyes. “I’ll be here alone?”', '“Don’t worry, Pip,” Elizabeth said. “Nothing bad ever happens in the woods during daylight.”', '\\xa0', 'She was wrong; bad things happened. Early in the day May tripped and landed hard, tearing her shirt and badly skinning her palms. Then Elizabeth dropped her digital camera into the river, and though it wasn’t expensive it also hadn’t been backed up for months. Ailey’s GPS was unpredictable. It worked well enough to get them where they were going, but it put Ailey in a crap mood. It was hot, and biting flies followed them, and they had to stop frequently for water and to catch their breath. They were headed to a waterfall, something dramatic, but the easier route Ailey had originally planned would have taken too long. So they were going the steep way, and would make it back to Piper before sunset.', 'When they got to the waterfall, Elizabeth and May made a bigger fuss over it than it deserved. Elizabeth made them pose for a picture she took with an imaginary camera, and then she threw the imaginary camera in the river. They sat on a rock and ate a late power bar–and–string cheese lunch.', 'At least the hike back was downhill.', 'They followed a ridge arcing away from the river. Gaps between branches showed glimpses of a valley tumbled with boulders. Wind hassled the pines.', '“What’s that?” Elizabeth said. Her brow was furrowed; she looked out and down through a clear spot on the side of the ravine. “Is there a road down there or something? I think I hear an engine.”', 'May joined Elizabeth at the vista. “Could be a plane.”', '“No road,” Ailey said. “It’s probably just a weird echo.”', '“Maybe there are other hikers down there,” Elizabeth said, and Ailey shrugged.', 'When they trudged into base camp, exhausted and thirsty and ready for dinner, Piper didn’t greet them.', '“Hello?” Ailey called. “We’re back.”', 'One of the tents rustled. The girls looked at each other, and Elizabeth took a step away.', '“Hey,” Piper called, delayed and strange.', 'May dropped her pack and unzipped the tent. “Hey,” she said, “you good?” She stuck her head into the tent, then recoiled. “Ooh, girl, if that smell was inside you no wonder you weren’t feeling well.”', '“I’m sick,” Piper said, still sprawled in her sleeping bag. Her voice was small and grave. “I’ve been throwing up all day.”', 'Ailey crouched by the tent opening. “You look pale,” she said. “Are you okay?”', '“Fuck!” Elizabeth yelled. “Holy shit!”', 'May jumped to her feet, looking around. “What?”', 'Something was crashing away through the bare undergrowth, a slim dark shape fading among the other slim dark shapes of the forest.', '“It was right ', ',” Elizabeth said. “Holy shit.”', 'May squinted. “A deer?”', '“I’m sick,” Piper said to Ailey. “I think I need to go to the hospital.”', '“Fuck,” Ailey said.', '“It was huge,” Elizabeth said. “It was right ', '.”', 'May crouched down again, squinting into the woods. She asked Ailey, “How long would it take us to get down to the car?”', '“Four hours. At normal speed.”', 'Elizabeth said, “If that was a deer then I’m Mother fucking Teresa. It was a moose. At least. But, like, a starving one.”', 'Ailey and May looked up at the sky. Already the anemic light came slanted from the west.', '“Guys,” Elizabeth said. “Did you see its horns? Antlers. Like it had huge fucking trees on its—”', '“Shut up for a second,” Ailey said. “Piper’s really sick.”', '“Yeah,” Elizabeth said, “But—okay. But did none of you see the\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. thing, though?”', '“It was a deer,” May said flatly. Elizabeth scowled at her.', 'They huddled around the ashes of the previous night’s fire to confer. It was too close to dark, the route too steep. “It’s better if we wait till morning,” Ailey said. She’d taken over the administration of Piper’s illness, and had moved her sleeping bag in next to the sick girl, relegating May to Elizabeth’s tent. May had not complained. “And maybe you’ll feel better with some sleep, Piper.”', 'From her sleeping bag in the zipped-open tent Piper grunted, too miserable to respond.', '\\xa0', 'May panicked awake in the dark. For disorienting seconds she wasn’t sure why she was cold, nor why the world was so slippery and unstable. And she wasn’t sure why she had woken, except that it was urgent.', 'When it happened again the scream was dangerously close to May’s ear. It was more of a yell, low-pitched and open-voweled; not the helpless keen of something lost but assertive, purposeful.', '“It’s back,” Elizabeth bellowed. “It’s here, what the fuck!” And then there was a slick weight on top of May, and an elbow found her gut and shoved out a yelp.', '“What the fuck!” Elizabeth said again, almost in May’s face. Her sleeping bag thrashed. A flashlight infused the tent with light from outside, and for a moment May saw Elizabeth’s face, frightened and pallid. Trapped, May tried to wiggle her sleeping bag away from the other girl.', '“What is it?” Ailey called, nearby. “What is it?” There was the sound of a zipper in the quiet, river-washed dark.', 'Knees, weight on May’s stomach pressing out her breath. She would be bruised in the morning. The tent zipper tore open and freed Elizabeth. The tent rocked. May struggled out of her bag and felt for her flashlight.', '“What is it?” Ailey repeated over Elizabeth’s ', '. Her flashlight bobbed and shuddered and then made loose, frantic sweeps. “Elizabeth, what?”', '“It was here,” she said. “The thing, the\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. the deer. The moose.”', '“Elizabeth.”', 'May crawled out of the tent, flashlight on, and floundered with her boots. “What’s going on?”', '“It was here,” Elizabeth repeated. She whipped the flashlight’s beam in a circle—she must have wrenched it away from Ailey—illuminating the stark columns of tree trunks and the quivering arms of lower branches. “It was there. Right there.”', 'Ailey spoke quietly. “There’s nothing there now.”', '“The deer?” May said. Her flashlight beam joined the sweep, but what were they looking for? “Girl, you’re freaking out. You stepped all over me.”', '“If it’s a deer, it won’t hurt us,” Ailey said. “Even if it’s a moose. You scared it away.” She took Elizabeth’s shoulders in her hands. “It’s okay,” she said, “you’re fine.”', '“No,” Elizabeth said. “No, it’s not—it was\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” She panted. “You don’t know.”', 'None of them wanted to go back to their tents, so they started another fire. Ailey checked on Piper and then the three of them sat, cross-legged, in the glow.', '“It wasn’t a dream,” Elizabeth said, “because I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t sleep last night either, and I wasn’t sleeping now.”', '“I was,” May muttered.', '“I saw it.”', '“How?” Ailey said. “From inside your tent?”', '“No,” Elizabeth turned, scanning the circle of light cast by the fire. “It was the outline. The shadow.”', '“Hon,” Ailey said, “it’s dark. You need light for a shadow.”', '“I know!” Elizabeth snapped. “I don’t know why I could see it. I just could. I wasn’t dreaming!”', 'May crossed her arms and leaned them against her knees, hands stuffed in her armpits. Her skull felt hollow. She was so tired she didn’t care what was going on, if Elizabeth was crazy from stress and sleep deprivation or if there was another explanation.', '“Okay, you couldn’t sleep.” Ailey sounded like she was persuading an animal out from hiding. “I wasn’t sleeping, either.”', 'Elizabeth looked over both shoulders at the dark balusters of the forest holding up the night. “Did you hear those noises?”', '“Like what?”', '“I don’t know. Snapping. Animal sounds.”', 'Ailey shook her head. “All I heard was the river. But we ', ' in the woods.”', 'Elizabeth groaned and dropped her head into her palms. “That’s not what I mean.”', '\\xa0', 'Piper couldn’t keep water down the next morning. She would only get up to stagger into the bushes, where May could hear her retching. Pale and disinterested, she didn’t complain and rarely moved. She was like a creature gone into hibernation, conserving herself against pain.', 'Ailey was In Charge again, having been certified—whatever that meant—in wilderness first aid. May listened to her inside the sick tent, quietly harassing Piper to try to drink. More whispering, rustling, and then Ailey ducked out to join them. Ailey sank to the ground next to restless Elizabeth, who sat with her back to the fire. They both looked as tired as May felt, though May was the only one who had gone back to sleep. Eventually. “I think maybe it’s appendicitis,” Ailey whispered, conspiratorial. “Or really terrible food poisoning. She can’t walk, though. It’s bad.”', '“I’m not staying here another night,” Elizabeth said.', 'Ailey held up a hand. “Shh,” she said, “I don’t want Piper to worry.”', 'May matched Ailey’s tone. “What should we do?”', '“Someone has to get help,” Ailey said. “We have to figure out who.”', '“Me,” Elizabeth said. “I’m fucking going.”', '“Okay,” Ailey said, “your opinion is registered. I get it. Let’s talk through this.”', '“Ailey, you know how to get around in the woods,” May said, feeling generous, though she also didn’t have much of a choice. She dreaded the idea of being left behind with Piper, propping her up as she squatted, straining, over a hole in the dirt, or holding her hair back, smelling the sour-sweet smell of illness and pain and shit and bile. “You should probably go.”', 'Ailey shook her head. “I can show anyone how to use the GPS. And it’s not hard to find your way out of here. If you head west you’ll hit the forest service road eventually.”', '“Okay,” May said. “Well, if it counts for anything, sick people freak me out.”', '“I’ll stay,” Ailey agreed. “I have survival skills. I can take care of Piper.”', 'May felt her body loosen, her mind clear, better than caffeine. “Okay,” she said. “Okay.”', 'Elizabeth stood. May realized Elizabeth’s bag was at her feet, already packed. She was only waiting to escape.', '\\xa0', '“I’m scared,” Elizabeth said.', 'Silver evergreen columns shot upward, bare, stories high, their crowns crowded against the ceiling of cloud. Overcast deadened the occasional pipe and rattle of birdcalls, and the wind undulated the tops of trees. The dark sky made the greens of moss and ferns in the undergrowth seem fluorescent and unreal.', '“I can tell,” May said. She felt better on the move, knowing she was doing what she could for Piper and Ailey. “It’s okay. We’ll be out of here soon.”', '“I’m the only one that gets it,” Elizabeth muttered. May rolled her eyes.', 'They trekked down into a little ravine, where everything fell still. Moss muffled the rock walls on both sides; water drained in rivulets over the rough surface and the patter sounded like a chewing mouth. It was beautiful, May thought, but not in a pleasant way. ', ' was a better word.', '“It’s like,” Elizabeth said, “I’ve read enough legends and myths. I know how those stories work. I can tell when—” She whipped her head around. “What was that?”', '“It was a bird,” May said without stopping. “Or a squirrel or an antelope or an elephant. It doesn’t matter, Elizabeth. We’re fine. Piper’s the only one in danger.”', '“There are things in the woods that don’t want people here.”', 'It wasn’t worth arguing. If Elizabeth wanted to believe in crazy, then fine, as long as it kept them moving.', '“I mean, Piper gets sick, and then I—”', '“Elizabeth,” May snapped. “Appendicitis. It’s not a curse, it’s a coincidence. This shit happens. Bad things happen all the time. You read too many subredditsThose stories aren’t real.”', 'Elizabeth whipped around again. She pointed, right into May’s face. Her eyes were swollen and red. “‘All stories are real at some point.’ You’re the one who said that. Even stupid fake stories have something real in them.”', 'May backed up a step. “Hey, okay, but scary stories are just supposed to scare you. That’s all they’re about.”', '“You said it yourself,” Elizabeth hissed. “People have told this story for centuries. There’s a reason. A moral. ‘Keep out.’ There’s something to be afraid of. In the woods.”', '“Look,” May said, “let’s go, okay? We both want to get out of here.”', 'Elizabeth sucked breath between clenched teeth. She looked a little deranged. May stepped in front to lead the way.', 'There was no trail, per se. Deer tracks cut through the heaped undergrowth here and there, making their way easier. It was green everywhere—thick, luxurious, luminous green, with the occasional slash of red leaves bleeding in contrast. Moss fogged rocks and dead trees. Branches draped lichen like hair. They passed into a stand of deciduous trees, birch maybe, all of which canted to the left, as though the land had abruptly dropped out from under them on one side. Wind shushed the leaves.', '“It’s been following me,” Elizabeth said quietly. “It’s been following me since last night.”', 'May didn’t turn around. She didn’t need to. They would get out of here, and Elizabeth would stop freaking out. “We have to keep going,” she said.', 'They stopped in a little clearing at the edge of a ridge where trees were uprooted, knocked flat by some winter cataclysm. The bleached skeletons of the trunks staggered drunkenly off the edge of the slope. “Check the GPS,” May suggested. “I think I remember this part. Down along this ridge, right?”', 'Elizabeth’s mouth was a hard, pale line. She fished the orange knob of plastic from her pack. “This way,” she confirmed.', '“See?” May said. “Almost there.”', 'Elizabeth looked over her shoulder, downhill. “Ailey said the road we came up on runs along the other side of that hill.” Elizabeth nodded toward the bank rising at the far side of the slope they stood above, split at the bottom by a hissing creek. “We could cut across.”', 'May snorted. “Uh, she also said it’s crazy steep, which is why we started where we did. You remember how it was driving here? The road ran at the bottom of a damn cliff most of the way up. Let’s go the way we came. It’s only another hour or something.” She tucked her thumbs under her backpack straps and turned away.', 'Elizabeth started more slowly, watching down the incline toward the creek.', 'The clouds heaped over each other until they lost their lustrous silver and turned pewter and then coal. May tried not to imagine what it would be like to be stranded and sick in a tent in driving rain. It was early enough in the day; all four of them would be off the mountain before the next morning. Ailey had said someone would come for them right away, on horses or ATVs as far as they could, with a litter for Piper and a whole team of people to carry it.', '“Do you hear that?” Elizabeth asked.', 'May stopped, turned back halfway. “Hear what?”', '“The humming.” Elizabeth scanned the rubbly slope below them, expression blank as she strained her hearing. “Or maybe whistling. Like an engine.” Her gaze snapped to May. “There’s someone on the road.”', 'They had to keep going. “We have our own car,” May said. The keys were zipped into her pocket. “We aren’t trapped. We just have to get to the car and drive for help.”', '“Maybe it’s a ranger,” Elizabeth said.', '“Even if it is, we couldn’t to do anything until we get down to the road. They wouldn’t even see us.”', '“There! Hear it?”', 'May listened, eyes upturned. “I don’t know,” she said, “it sounds like some weird echo. The wind. Seriously, we’re almost back, we just have to keep walking.”', '“We could be out of here in minutes if we went over that hill. It’s right there.”', 'May sighed. “We would be at the top of a steep-ass cliff with a road at the bottom of it and no way to get down. And we’d still have to walk to the car. And I don’t even hear anything. You’re making this way more complicated than it needs to be.”', 'Elizabeth said nothing. She turned in a slow circle, looking up into the dark pillars of the forest rising above them. The wind pushed the treetops in lazy, bobbing circles.', 'This time Elizabeth followed immediately when May set off, and stayed close. May could see the way the other girl twitched at birdcalls, the wide-open flashing of her eyes. Fear did wild things to people. And exhaustion. She shouldn’t hold Elizabeth’s panic against her.', 'Something crashed nearby. Both girls startled, and May yelped. The bushes uphill shuddered. May saw long, slim legs, long, gaunt lines of a body, a rising crown of branching antler.', '“No!” Elizabeth yelled. “No!” Then she bolted over the edge of the ridge.', 'May heard scree tumbling, rocks crack-clattering, and the rumble of cascading gravel. “Elizabeth!” she yelled. “It’s a deer!” The thing in the underbrush, the deer, leapt off in the opposite direction, rustle and crackle and thud.', 'Elizabeth was running, arms up to keep her balance, stones dancing and leaping around her feet. It took less than a minute for her to reach the creek at the bottom.', '“Elizabeth!” May shouted. “Wait!” She checked over her shoulder. “Elizabeth, it’s a fucking deer. Come back!”', 'The distance made Elizabeth the size of May’s finger, small enough to squash. Tiny Elizabeth picked across the stream at the bottom of the ravine. May saw her stumble in the water, then crawl out on the far bank.', '“For real?” she muttered. “', '”', 'Elizabeth scrabbled up the loose incline. May stayed put. The thing in the forest rattled off into silence. May watched until Elizabeth disappeared into the trees on the far bank, and then turned back down the mountain.', 'Elizabeth had the GPS, along with its locating beacon. May had the car keys. And now they were alone, but probably they would both be fine.', '\\xa0', 'She waited a long hour, and then started the car. “Sorry,” she said into the humid, oppressive air. And: “I’ll come back.” Elizabeth had the GPS. Elizabeth had it, and they both had the coordinates of where Ailey and Piper were. And Piper was sick.', 'There was no cell signal, not anywhere, and the road was deserted. There weren’t even road signs. The sky was low and scowling, but holding back, holding its breath—there was no wind. Motionless, gravid, and a sense of being watched.', 'May stopped at the first little grocery she saw. It was half–boarded up but it had an Open sign in the window, and maybe something moved in the dim inside, but the door was locked and there was no answer at her knock. Behind her, a crow lighted next to a puddle in the parking lot, its reflection playing against the glass door like a mirror. It dropped a twig from its beak.', 'She drove endless minutes, checking her phone for bars. None of the other structures tucked into the woods seemed alive. Some of the buildings tumbled in at the roofline, others were barricaded with junk. She stopped once where an old truck sat in a driveway, and banged at the door of the trailer until her knuckles hurt.', 'Back in the car. The sky was darkening, the storm shoving closer to the ground, but no rain yet. In the dark fur of pines she saw a glint of light. A big house, set back, A-frame roof glowing golden at its windows.', 'Its narrow driveway wound into the woods. May felt her pulse in her skin. Maybe she’d get to take a shower today. Maybe whoever owned this house would be awesome, and the emergency personnel would come and take her information and the GPS coordinates, and then she’d be tucked into a bed with cocoa and pillows and cable TV.', 'The driveway was long. Overgrown branches dragged thick fingers along the windows like nails. Despite the neglect, the house the driveway spilled out in front of was ostentatiously nice. Celebrity nice, and gloriously lit. Nobody left this many lights on if they weren’t home.', 'Her boots thudded the porch boards. She pushed the doorbell. She pushed it again, and when nothing happened, she knocked. Her knuckles ached from the knocking she’d done before, so she used the side of her fist instead.', 'Somewhere in the house a small dog barked. No one came to the door. May’s head began to throb. Inside, upstairs, there was a muffled bump of wood against wood.', 'Frustration burned between her vertebrae. She banged harder, this time on the glass. She wanted to kick the door. “Hey!” she yelled. “Is someone home? Goddammit!”', 'Overhead, on the face of the house, something slid and clicked. A woman’s voice rang out. “Go away!”', '“Hey!” May scrambled down the porch steps to find the origin of the voice. “Hello! I need help!”', '“I’m not alone in here,” the woman’s voice said. The little dog barked again, louder through the open window.', 'May looked up. She felt her arms at her sides, waving, like they were flapping, like she would take off and fly up to the pretty, pale, middle-aged brunette who frowned out the open window at her. “I need help! My friend is hurt! She’s sick!”', 'The woman bared her teeth. May felt the distance between herself and the stranger up there. She matched the woman’s expression without thinking, a bone-smile of defeat. “My friend is dying in the woods and I need help,” she shouted. Screamed, really. ', ', May wanted to add, ', '. But she didn’t say it. She didn’t want to have to say it in order to get into this big stupid fancy house.', '“I’m not alone,” the woman yelled again. “And I have my husband’s guns. Go away!” The window slammed shut.', 'A small breeze carried a scatter of raindrops. One landed in May’s eyelashes. She blinked it away. The clouds seemed to pile on top of the incline behind the house; far up, for a moment, May thought she saw a dark human shape spidering across the scree.', 'The porch light went out. In the hush May could hear a wind begin to shake the hillside. She watched it crawl down over the trees toward her. It reached the yard and its landscaped saplings; they tossed their skinny arms; they bucked their backs; they shook their heads. The wind slapped a handful of rain into her face.', ', she thought. ', 'She turned her back into the growing wind. The great house before her showed no evidence of its inhabitant. May wondered how the lady had turned the porch light off from upstairs.', 'Beyond the door was a warm-lit, high-ceilinged living room, all hewn wood. Everything in there looked expensive. In the nearby open kitchen May could see a landline phone in its charging station on the granite counter.', 'Another gust chugged down the hill, this one bringing the resolute thrum of hard rain.', 'The phone was close enough that May could see the numbers on it. She reached for the door, tried the knob without really thinking. Her breath caught when the latch turned and the door swung inward.', 'Why would it be locked? It was midday, despite the dark skies, and there was nobody around to lock out.', 'At the back of the living room there was a set of stairs, opposite the kitchen, where she could keep her eye on them. The phone was cordless. She could take it to the porch.', 'She breathed through her mouth, rocked her boots silently heel-to-toe as she pushed into the cozy light of the house. A gust of wind rattled the kitchen’s big picture windows and the French doors, which led to a paved patio. It was dim and green outside, a deep-water aquarium. She checked the silent stairs. No dog, no crazy lady. The windows pulsed again, clattered with rain.', 'Her heart was somewhere between her stomach and her ribcage, a fat soft throbbing bullfrog. The granite countertop had a few pieces of mail, a catalog, a dish with crumbs on it. May wrapped her hand around the phone handset. It made a quiet ', ' as she lifted it from its station.', 'A ', ' of wind again on the side of the house made her jump as she turned to creep back to the porch.', 'She felt the crash instead of heard it, the pitch of shattering glass. And then a great dark figure, a gaunt and branch-crowned bestial silhouette the details of which her eyes could not negotiate, stepped through the broken French doors and into the kitchen. It made the house seem suddenly crowded, as though a landslide had carried a grove of black trees into the living room.', 'Her forearms stung, and May registered with wonder the fine red lines that appeared there. Flying glass, it must have been.', 'Feet banged on the stairs, and there was screaming but not from May’s throat, May was too stunned to scream, too caught out with the phone in her hand and the darkness that had demolished the French doors and slipped into the cozy living room. The room thrummed with wind. From the corner of her vision May saw the woman on the stairs, and yes, she did have a gun, the kind you’d take hunting for deer, and she held it stiffly and wild-eyed as it swung its aim across the downstairs. May was backing away, the lady’s screaming pushing her toward the open front door, which the wind was slowly arcing closed.', 'The great shape, the long-legged blackness and its great reverent leafless crown, stepped, set its hooves, stole forward. Its legs like boughs, its silhouette a thatch of dark fingers of void woven together. The room smelled of ozone, of crushed leaves. The storm swept through the living room, a physical punch of wind resounding against the kitchen cupboards, sweeping May’s hair off her neck.', 'The backyard trees bowed, thrashed, banged their elbows together.', 'The woman was screaming down the stairs, the gun sweeping over May and the rest of the room, and May couldn’t imagine she could possibly be a target with that magnificent, awful thing drowning the light out of the room between them. She stepped back again, felt the phone in her hand, wondered what 9-1-1 would do about\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. this. What kind of help to ask for. And what use was a gun? The lady was looking at her and shouting incoherent threats and terror, the long cold nose of her gun pointed high.', 'It—the thing, the creature, if it was even truly there—lifted its dreadful, awful crest and looked at May with no eyes.', 'Her back was against the front door. It must have swung closed. It must have shut in the wind as she backed toward it. She felt the knob, felt the catch of its lock.', 'The gun sounded, a powerful blast muffled by the house and the storm pummeling everything, and with the violence of the sound everything fell instantly still. Everything vibrated at the same imperceptibly high frequency. Everything felt the storm holding its breath.', 'Whose story would this be, May thought: hers, or Piper’s, or Ailey’s, or Elizabeth’s?', 'The thing, the creature, the blackness, shivered with the wind. It turned itself toward her slowly, like a question.', '“A Forest, or A Tree” copyright © 2019 by Tegan Moore.', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by Samuel Araya.']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['For He Can Creep'], 'Author': ['Siobhan Carroll'], 'Body': ['A dark fantasy about Jeoffry, a cat who fights demons, a poet, who is Jeoffry’s human confined to an insane asylum, and Satan, who schemes to end the world.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Flash and fire! Bristle and spit! The great Jeoffry ascends the madhouse stairs, his orange fur on end, his yellow eyes narrowed!', 'On the third floor the imps cease their gamboling. Is this the time they stay and fight? One imp, bolder than the others, flattens himself against the flagstones. He swells himself with nightmares, growing huge. His teeth shine like the sword of an executioner, and his eyes are the colors of spilled whale oil before a match is struck. In their cells, the filthy inmates shrink away from his immensity, wailing.', 'But Jeoffry does not shrink. He rushes up the last few stairs like the Deluge of God, and his claws are sharp! The imps run screaming, flitting into folds of space only angels and devils can penetrate.', 'In the hallway, Jeoffry cleans the smoking blood off his claws. Some of the humans whisper their thanks to him; some even dare to stroke his fur through the bars. Sometimes Jeoffry accepts this praise and sometimes he is bored by it. Today, annoyed by the imps’ vain show of defiance, he leaves his scent on every door. This cell is his, and this one. The whole asylum is his, and let no demon forget it! For he is the Cat Jeoffry, and no demon can stand against him.', '\\xa0', 'On the second floor, above the garden, the poet is trying to write. He has no paper, and no pens—such things are forbidden, after his last episode—and so he scratches out some words in blood on the brick wall. Silly man. Jeoffry meows at him. It is time to pay attention to Jeoffry!', 'The man remembers his place. Reluctantly, painfully, he detaches his tattered mind from the hard hook-pins of word and meter. He rolls away from his madness and strokes the purring, winding cat.', 'Hail and well met, Jeoffry. Have you been fighting again? Such a bold gentleman you are. Such a pretty fellow. Who’s a good cat?', 'Jeoffry knows he is a good cat, and a bold gentleman, and a pretty fellow. He tells the poet as much, pushing his head repeatedly at the man’s hands, which smell unpleasantly of blood. The demons have been at him again. A cat cannot be everywhere at once, and so, while Jeoffry was battling the imps on the third floor, one of the larger dark angels has been whispering in the poet’s ear, its claws scorching the bedspread.', 'Jeoffry feels . . . not guilty exactly, but annoyed. The poet is ', ' human. Yet, of all the humans, the demons seem to like the poet the best, perhaps because he is not theirs yet, or perhaps because they are interested—as so many visitors seem to be—in the man’s poetry.', 'Jeoffry does not see the point of poems. Music he can appreciate as a human form of yowling. Poems, though. From time to time visitors come to the madhouse and speak to the poet of translations and Psalms and ninety-nine-year publishing contracts. At such times, the poet smells of sweat and fear. Sometimes he rants at the men, sometimes curls up into a ball. Once, one of the men even stepped on Jeoffry’s tail—unforgivable! Since then Jeoffry had made a point of hissing at every man who came to them smelling of ink.', 'I wish I had the fire in your belly, the poet says, and Jeoffry knows he is speaking of the creditors again. You would give them a fight, eh? But I fear I have not your courage. I will promise them their paper and perhaps scratch out a stupidity or two, but I cannot do it, Jeoffry. It takes me away from the Poem. What is a man to do, when God wants him to write one poem, and his creditors another?', 'Jeoffry considers his poet’s problem as he licks his fur back into place. He’d heard of the Poem before—the one true poem that God had written to unfold the universe. The poet believes it is his duty to translate this poem by communing with God. His fellow humans, on the other hand, think the poet should write silly things called satires, as he used to do. This is the kind of thing humans think about, and fight about, and for which they chain up their fellow humans in nasty sweaty madhouse cells.', 'Jeoffry does not particularly care about either side of the debate. But—he thinks as he catches a flea and crunches it between his teeth—if he were to have an opinion, it would be that the humans should let the man finish his Divine Poem. The ways of the Divine Being were unfathomable—he’d created dogs, after all—and if the Creator wanted a poem, the poet should give it to him. And then the poet would have more time to pet Jeoffry.', 'O cat, the poet says, I am glad of your companionship. You remind me how it is our duty to live in the present moment, and love God through His creation. If you were not here I think the devil would have claimed me long ago.', 'If the poet were sane, he might have thought better of his words. But madmen do not guard their tongues, and cats have no thoughts of the future. It’s true, something does occur to Jeoffry as the poet speaks—some vague sense of disquiet—but then the man scratches behind his ears, and Jeoffry purrs in luxury.', '\\xa0', 'That night, Satan comes to the madhouse.', 'Jeoffry is curled at his usual spot on the sleeping poet’s back when the devil arrives. The devil does not enter as his demons do, in whispers and the patterning of light. His presence steals into the room like smoke, and as with smoke, Jeoffry is aware of the danger before he is even awake, his fur on end, his heart pounding.', '“Hello, Jeoffry,” the devil says.', 'Jeoffry extends his claws. At that moment, he knows something is wrong, for the poet, who normally would wake with a howl at such an accidental clawing, lies still and silent. All around Jeoffry is a quiet such as cats never hear: no mouse or beetle creeping along a madhouse wall, no human snoring, no spider winding out its silk. It as if the Night itself has hushed to listen to the devil’s voice, which sounds pleasant and warm, like a bucket of cream left in the sun.', '“I thought you and I should have a chat,” Satan says. “I understand you’ve been giving my demons some trouble.”', 'The first thought that flashes into Jeoffry’s head is that Satan looks exactly as Milton describes him in ', '. Only more cat-shaped. (Jeoffry, a poet’s cat, has ignored vast amounts of Milton over the years, but some of it has apparently stuck.)', 'The second thought is that the devil has come into his territory, and this means fighting!', 'Puffing himself up to his utmost size, Jeoffry spits at the devil and shows his teeth.', 'This is my place! he cries. Mine!', '“Is anything truly ours?” The devil sighs and examines his claws. He is simultaneously a monstrous serpent, a mighty angel, and a handsome black cat with whiskers the color of starlight. The cat’s whiskers are singed, the serpent’s scales are scarred, and the angel’s brow is heavy with an ancient grievance, and yet he is still beautiful, in his way. “But more of this later. Jeoffry, I have come to converse with you. Will you not take a walk with me?”', 'Jeoffry pauses, considering. Do you have treats?', '“I have feasts awaiting. Catnip fresh from the soil. Salted ham from the market. Fish heads with the eyes still in them, scrumptiously poppable.”', 'I want treats.', '“And treats you shall have. Come and see.”', 'Jeoffry trots at the devil’s heels down the madhouse stairs, past the mouse’s nest on the landing, past the kitchen with its pleasant smell of bread and pork fat, through the asylum’s heavy door (which stands mysteriously open), and onto roads of Darkness, beneath which the round orb of Earth hangs like a jewel. Jeoffry gazes with interest up at the blue glow of the Crystalline Firmament, at the fixed stars, and at the golden chain of Heaven, from which all the Universe is suspended. He feels hungry.', '“Well,” the devil says presently. “Let’s get the formalities out of the way.” He snaps his fingers. Instantly Jeoffry is dangling above the Earth, staring down at it as one does at a patterned carpet. He can see the gleaming rooftop of the madhouse, and Bethnal Green, and the darkened streets of London, still bustling, even at this time of night.', '“All of this could be yours,” Satan says. “Yea, I will give you all the kingdoms of Earth if you’d but bow down and worship me.”', 'Jeoffry does not like being dangled. His fur bristles as he prepares himself to fall. But then he catches the smell of the fish market in the air, and hears the distant yowl of a tomcat making love on the street. And Jeoffry understands, for a moment, what the devil is offering him. He understands, also, that this offer represents a fundamentally wrong order to the universe.', 'You should bow down and worship Jeoffry!', '“Right,” the devil says. “I thought as much.”', 'He snaps his fingers again, and they are back on the path between the fixed stars, with the planets far below them.', '“You have the sin of pride, cat,” Satan says. “A sin I am particularly fond of, given that it is my own. For that reason I am taking you into my confidence. You see, I have an interest in your poet.”', 'Mine!', '“That’s debatable. There are multiple claims to Mr. Smart. The Tyrant of Heaven’s, his debtors’, his family’s . . . the man is like a ruined estate, overrun with scavengers. Me,” the devil shrugs, “he owes for some of his earlier debaucheries—he was an extravagant man in his youth—and for that I need to collect.”', 'Jeoffry’s tail twitches back and forth. Like many who have conversed with the devil, he can sense something wrong with this dark tide of speech, a lie buried beneath Satan’s reasonable arguments. But he cannot work out what it is.', '“Now,” says the Adversary, “I would be willing to forgive this debt if your poet would but write ', ' a poem. I have the perfect thing in mind: a metered piece of guile that, unleashed, would lay waste to Creation.', '“Indeed,” the devil says, “I have planted this poem in his imagination on several occasions. But your poet is stubborn. He defies all his creditors (including, most importantly, me), and insists on writing this tripe, this vile piece of sycophancy, for the Tyrant of Heaven, who—let me assure you—deserves no such praise.”', 'The Poem of Poems, Jeoffry says.', '“Exactly. Let us face facts, Jeoffry. The Poem your human labors over—the thing to which he has devoted his last years of labor, burning away his health, destroying his human relationships—even setting aside my feelings on its subject matter, Jeoffry, the fact is this: The poem he writes is ', '.”', 'Jeoffry stares at his paws, and beneath them, at the blue glow of Earth. Vaguely the words of the poet’s human visitors come to him. Have they not said much the same thing?', '“Speaking as a critic now, Jeoffry: Do you not think the poem’s Let-For structure is overly complicated? The wordplay in Latin and Greek too obscure to suit the common taste? Obscurity for the sake of obscurity, Jeoffry. It will get him nowhere.”', 'Poetry is prayer, Jeoffry says stiffly, repeating the words the poet murmurs to himself as he scratches frantically at his papers, or the bricks, or at the skin on his forearms.', '“Poetry is poetry. Two roads diverging in a yellow wood, people wandering about like clouds, even that terrible thing about footprints—that’s what readers want, Jeoffry. Something simple, and clear, with a message: that all of one’s life choices may be justified by looking at daffodils; that we exist in a world abandoned by God and haunted by human mediocrity. Don’t you agree?”', 'Jeoffry does not like literature of any kind, unless it is about Jeoffry. Even then, petting is better. And eating. Are there treats now?', '“Ah, treats.”', 'Instantly a banquet table is before Jeoffry. Everything the devil had promised is there: the fish heads, the salted ham—and things he forgot to mention, like the vats of cream and crispy salmon skins. There’s even a bowl of Turkish delight.', 'Jeoffry bolts toward the food. Suddenly, a hand catches him by the scruff of the neck. The devil has grown gigantic, a mighty warrior, singed and scarred by his contest with heaven. His smile gleams like a knife.', '“Before you eat, Jeoffry, I need a thing of you. Such a small thing.”', 'I want the food.', '“And you shall get it, if you but promise me this: to stand aside when I come to visit your poet tomorrow night. Aye, to stand aside, and not interfere.”', 'The uneasy sense that Jeoffry had felt at the devil’s first words returns with a vengeance.', 'Why?', '“Merely so I can converse with your poet.”', 'Jeoffry thinks about Satan’s proposition. As a cat well-versed in Milton, he is aware of the devil’s less-than-salubrious reputation. On the other hand, there’s a giant vat of cream ', '.', 'I agree, he says.', 'The devil smiles. Released, Jeoffry flies to the table, and food! There is so much food! He eats and eats, and somehow there is still more to eat, and somehow he can keep eating, though his belly is starting to hurt.', '“My thanks to you, Jeoffry,” the devil says. “I will see you tomorrow.”', 'Jeoffry is aware, vaguely, that Satan is walking away from him. But that does not matter: He has come to the bowl of Turkish delight, and having heard so much about it, it must taste good, no? So he selects a powdered cube of honey and rosewater, one that is larger than all the others, and he takes a bite—', '\\xa0', 'The next day, Jeoffry feels ill.', 'On waking, he performs his morning prayers as he always does. He wreathes his body seven times around with elegant quickness. He leaps up to catch the musk, and rolls on the planks to work it in. He performs the cat’s self-examination in ten degrees, first, looking on his forepaws to see if they are clean, then stretching, then sharpening his claws by wood, then washing himself, then rolling about, then checking himself for fleas. . . .', 'Yet none of this makes Jeoffry feel better. It is as though something casts a shadow upon him, separating the cat from the sunlight that is his due. With a chill, Jeoffry remembers his bargain with the devil. Was it a dream?', 'Well met, Jeoffry, well met. The poet is awake, and his eyes look unusually clear. He sits up on his bed of straw, and stretches.', 'I feel better today, Jeoffry, as if my sickness is leaving me. Oh, but they are sure to duck me again, to drive the devils out. You are lucky, cat, to have no devils in you, for you’d hate being ducked.', 'The poet rubs Jeoffry’s head, affectionately, then looks again. But how’s this, Jeoffry? You look unwell, my friend.', 'Jeoffry meows. His stomach feels sickly heavy, as though he has eaten a barrel full of rotten fish. He tries to say something about the devil—not that the human would understand, but it seems worth trying—and instead vomits on the poet’s leg.', 'Heavens, Jeoffry! What have you been eating!', 'Jeoffry noses his vomit to see if there’s anything there worth re-eating, but the remnants of the devil’s meal are a pile of dead leaves, partly digested. The devil’s visit was no dream, then.', 'The poet tries to catch him, but Jeoffry is too quick. He slips down the staircase, where he vomits, to the kitchen, where he vomits, until he sees a water bowl put down for the physician’s dog. He drinks from it. And vomits.', 'He vomits on the cook, who tries to catch him, and on the terrier-dog, which yaps at him as he jumps to the top cupboard. Is there so much vomit in the world? (Apparently.)', 'Miserable Jeoffry curls up on top of the cupboard and puts a paw over his eyes to shut out the light. He sleeps an uneasy sleep, in which Satan stalks through his dreams in the guise of a giant black cat, chuckling.', 'When Jeoffry opens his eyes again it is evening. He can hear the grind and clink of iron keys above him. The keepers are locking the cell doors. Soon the demons will arrive in full force, to gambol and chitter in the shadows, and pull at the lunatics’ beards, and drive them madder.', 'Jeoffry clambers to his feet. His legs are shaky, but he drives himself onward, leaping awkwardly to the kitchen floor. The smell of his vomit still hangs in the air, acrid, with an aura of sulfur.', 'Jeoffry climbs the stairs. The mice behind the walls peep at him as he lumbers past. The imps giggle in the distance, but he sees none in the hallways of the second floor. With a sinking heart, he paces onward, to the room where his poet sits, composing his great work.', 'As Jeoffry approaches the poet’s cell, a great wind seems to blow from its door. Jeoffry flattens himself against the ground and tries to slink forward, but the wind is too strong. It presses on him with the hands of a thousand dark angels, with the weight of Leviathan, with the despair of the world. He claws at the floorboards, shredding wood, but he cannot go farther.', '“Now, now, Jeoffry,” a voice says in his head. “Did you not promise me that you would stand aside?”', 'Jeoffry yowls in response. He tries to tell the devil that he takes back his bargain, that the food he ate was merely vegetation, that he vomited it all up anyway, that Turkish delight is overrated.', '“A bargain is a bargain,” the voice says. The wind grows stronger. Jeoffry feels himself floating up in the air. A sudden gust jerks him backward, and then—', '\\xa0', 'Jeoffry wakes. There is a sour smell in the air—not vomit this time, but something else. Jeoffry is lying in the second floor’s empty cell, the one where the human strangled herself on her chains. The iron hoops stare at him accusingly.', 'Jeoffry uncoils himself, and as he does so he remembers the previous evening. The devil, the wind, and the vomit. (O the vomit!) And the poet.', 'He takes off at a run. The poet is sitting up on his bed of straw, his face slack-jawed. Jeoffry headbutts him, and winds around him, and paws his face. Even so, it takes a while for the poet to transfer his gaze to Jeoffry.', 'O cat, the poet says. I fear I have done a terrible thing.', 'Jeoffry rubs his chin against the man’s skinny knee. He purrs, willing the world repaired.', 'Last night the devil himself came to me, the man says. He said such things . . . I withstood him as long as I could, but in the end, I could take no more. I begged him, on my knees, to stop his whisperings. And he asked me—and I agreed. O cat, I am damned for certain! For I have promised the devil a poem.', 'As he gave this speech, the man’s hands kneaded Jeoffry’s back harder and harder, digging into his flesh until it hurt. Normally this would trigger a clawing, or a stern meow, but Jeoffry understands now what it means to come face-to-face with the devil, and his heart is sore.', 'Jeoffry does what he can to comfort the poet. He spraggles and waggles. He frolics about the room. He takes up the wine cork the man likes to toss for him, and drops it on the poet’s lap. And yet none of this seems to lift the poet’s spirits.', 'The man curls in the corner and moans until the attendants come to take him away for his morning ducking. Jeoffry lies on the floor, in the sun, and thinks.', 'The poet is miserable, and well he might be, having agreed to write a poem for the devil. Jeoffry, in agreeing to stand aside, left his human undefended. In that action (and here Jeoffry must think very hard, and lay his ears back) Jeoffry has been less than his normal, wonderful self. He may in fact have been (though this is almost impossible to think) a ', '.', 'Jeoffry is furious at the thought. He attacks the air. Growling, he flies about the room, ripping the spiderwebs down from the ceiling. He gets in the man’s straw bed and whirls around and around, until bits of straw coat the floor and the dust veils him in yellow. Somehow, none of it helps.', 'When he is exhausted, he sits and licks himself clean. Even a short poem will take the poet more than a day to write, for he must doubt every word, and scratch it out, and write it down again. That is more than enough time for Jeoffry to find the devil, and fight him, and bite him on the throat.', 'It is true that the devil is bigger than the biggest rat Jeoffry has ever fought, and it is also true that he is Satan, the Adversary, Prince of Hell, Lord of Evil. Nevertheless, the devil made a grave mistake when he annoyed Jeoffry. He will pay for his insolence.', 'Thus resolved, Jeoffry goes in quest of food. His heart feels lighter. He has a feeling that soon, all will be well.', '\\xa0', 'When he comes back from his ducking, the poet lies on his bed and weeps. Jeoffry cannot rub against him after the water treatment, for the poet’s skin is still unpleasantly damp. So Jeoffry claws the wooden bedframe instead.', 'Ah, Jeoffry, the poet cries. They gave me back my paper! And my quill, and ink! Yesterday I would have been overjoyed at such a kindness, but now I can only detect the machinations of the devil! It is all in my head, Jeoffry—the poem entire. I need only set it to paper. But I know I must not. These words—oh they must not be allowed to enter this world!', 'And yet he takes out a sheet of cotton paper, and his gum sandarac powder, and his ruler. Sobbing, he begins to write. The noise of his quill scritch-scritching is like the sound of ants eating through wood. It wrinkles Jeoffry’s nose, but he does not stir from the poet’s cell. He is waiting for the devil to arrive.', 'Sure enough, come nightfall, the devil steals into the madhouse. He looks for all the world like a London critic, in a green striped waistcoat and a velvet coat. He stands outside the bars of the cell and peers inside.', '“How now, Jeoffry,” Satan says. “How does my poet fare?” It is plain to see that the poet is shivering and sobbing on his bed. At the sound of the devil’s voice, he buries his face in his hands and begins murmuring a prayer.', 'Jeoffry turns disdainfully to the wall. The devil tricked him. The devil is bad. The devil may not have the pleasure of stroking Jeoffry or petting him on the head. Jeoffry is more interested in staring at this wall. Staring intently. Maybe there is a fly here, maybe not. This wall is more interesting than you, Satan.', '“Alas,” Satan says. “Much as it wounds me to lose your good opinion, Jeoffry, tonight I have other fish to fry.” With that, Satan directs his attention to the poet, and he says in the language of the humans: “How goes my poem?”', 'Get behind me, Satan!', '“Please,” the devil says, hooking his hands in the lapels of his coat. “’Tis a sad thing when a wordsmith resorts to clichés. And hardly good manners in addressing an old friend! What, did I not aid you in your youth many a time, in bedding a wench or evading a creditor? Now I ask that you do a single thing for me, and you whimper about repaying my kindness? For shame.”', 'I should not have agreed to it! the man says. Forgive me, Lord, for I was weak!', '“La,” the devil says, “aren’t we all. But enough of this moping. How goes my poem?”', 'The man is jerked upright like a dog yanked on a chain. He rises from his bed—in his nightclothes, no less—and takes up a few sheets of paper. He hands them, with an iron-stiff arm, through the bars to the devil.', 'The devil takes out a pair of amber spectacles and a red quill. He reads over the papers with great interest, from time to time making happy humming noises to himself, and from time to time frowning and scratching down something in bursts of flame. “Capital phrasing sir!” he says, and “Sir, you ', ' rhyme love with dove, it is banal and I shall not allow it,” and “I like this first reference to ‘An Essay on Man,’ but this second makes you seem derivative, don’t you think?”', 'The poet, peering at the pages from the vantage point of his madmen’s cell, looks miserable. Jeoffry, inside the cell, begins to growl. Will not the devil come inside? Very well, then Jeoffry will come to him.', '“This is marvelous work, sir,” the devil says, slotting the manuscript back between the poet’s trembling fingers. “I am very pleased with your progress. Do contemplate the edits I suggested. I will be back tomorrow midnight to collect the final version.”', 'I will not do it!', '“But you ', ', good sir. You have made your bargain. Now, you can sit here, wallowing in misery, or you can comfort yourself that your poem will inscribe itself on the hearts of men. It is all the same to me.”', 'During this conversation, Jeoffry slips through the bars. The devil is wearing an elegant pair of French boots—of course the devil would favor French leather, thinks the very English Jeoffry—and when the devil turns on his heel, Jeoffry pounces.', 'Claw and bite! Snap and climb! Jeoffry is simultaneously attacking a black cat with wicked claws and a mighty dragon of shining scale and a gentleman who is trying to shake him off his leg. Jeoffry is tossed by the devil like the Ark on the waves of destruction. He is smashed and crashed, bitten and walloped. Still, Jeoffry clings to him, growling and clawing!', '“Oh bother,” says the devil. “Those were my favorite stockings.”', 'Fire and darkness! Shade and sorrow! The devil has shaken him off. Jeoffry flies through the air and skids across the floorboards. But instantly he is on his feet again, his eyes ablaze, his skin electric. He will not let the devil go!', '“Must we?” says the devil wearily. “Oh very well.”', 'Now the devil begins to fight in earnest, and he is a terror. He is a thousand yellow-toothed rats swarming out of a sewer. He is a mighty angel whose wingbeats breed hurricanes. He is a gentleman with a walking stick. Wallop!', 'Jeoffry’s chest explodes with pain. Dazed, for a moment he thinks he cannot rise. But he must, and his legs carry him back into the fight.', 'Jeoffry stalks the devil anew, trying to keep clear of Satan’s walking-stick wings. Suddenly the black cat is there, clawing at Jeoffry’s eyes and springing away before Jeoffry can land a blow. Jeoffry hisses and puffs up his fur, but somewhere in his aching chest is the sense that, perhaps, this is a fight he cannot win. Perhaps this is the fight that kills Jeoffry.', 'So be it. Jeoffry leaps on the back of the cat/rat/angel/dragon. He draws blood, the devil’s blood, which smells of burning roses.', 'Too quickly, the devil twists under his grip. Too quickly, the yellow teeth clamp down. Agony sears through Jeoffry’s neck. The devil has him by the throat.', 'Jeoffry struggles for purchase, but he can find none. His vision darkens. He can feel the devil’s teeth press hard against the pulse of his life.', 'Dimly he hears the poet yelling. No, no! the man cries. Please spare my cat! We’ll cause you no more trouble, I swear!', 'The devil loosens his grip. “Ooph ooph,” he says. He spits out Jeoffry and tries again. “Very well.”', 'And Jeoffry is falling through blackness, falling forever—', '\\xa0', 'Jeoffry is in pain. The bite the devil gave him throbs fiercely. It is in the wrong place to lick, and yet he tries, and that hurts too.', 'Poor Jeoffry! Poor Jeoffry! the poet says. O you brave cat. May the Lord Jesus bless you and your wounds.', 'Jeoffry’s ears flick back and forth. Worse than the pain is the heaviness in his chest that comes from having lost a fight. Jeoffry lose a fight! Such things were possible when he was a kitten, but now—', 'I can feel the paper calling to me even now, the poet sighs. O Jeoffry, sleep here and grow well again. I must to my task.', 'At this Jeoffry leaves off licking his wounds and stares at the poet. He means to convey that the man should not write this poem. For once, the man seems to understand.', 'O Jeoffry, I have made a deal, and I feel in my bones that I cannot fight it. When I hand him that poem, I will give him my very soul! But what can be done? There is nothing to be done, Jeoffry. You must get better. And the poem must be written.', 'Jeoffry does not even have the strength to protest. He drinks from the water bowl the poet has put near him, and sleeps for a while in the sun.', 'When he opens his eyes the afternoon light is slanting through the barred window. Clumsily, Jeoffry rises and performs his orisons. As he cleans himself he considers the problem of the devil and the poet. This is not a fight Jeoffry can win. The traitorous thought clenches his throat, and for a moment he wants to push it away. But that will not help the poet.', 'So instead, Jeoffry does what he never does, and considers the weaknesses and frailties of Jeoffry.', 'Magnificent though he is, he thinks, Jeoffry is not in himself enough to defeat the devil. Something else must be done. Something humbling, and painful.', 'Once he is resolved, Jeoffry slips out of the cell. He does not take up his customary spot under the kitchen table, but instead limps into the courtyard, to where the cook has laid out a bowl of milk for the other cats, the ones who do not rule the madhouse.', 'Polly is the first to appear. She is an old lover of his, a sleek gray cat with a tattered ear and careful deportment. She looks distressed to see his wounds.', '<What now, Jeoffry?> Polly says in the language of cats, which is more eloquent and capacious than the sounds they reserve for humans. <You look as though a hound has chewed you up.>', '<I fought Satan,> Jeoffry says. <And I lost.>', 'Polly investigates Jeoffry’s wounds. <The devil has bitten you on the throat.>', '<I know.>', 'Polly leans forward and licks the bite. Jeoffry flicks his ears back, but accepts her aid. It is the first good thing that has happened this day.', 'Next comes Black Tom, the insufferable alley cat. <How now, Jeoffry,> he says. <You look the worse for wear.>', '<He fought the devil,> Polly says.', '<And I lost.>', '<Haha! Of course you did.> Tom helps himself to the milk. When he is finished he sits back and cleans his whiskers. <No style, Jeoffry, no style. That’s your problem.>', '<My style worked well enough when I fought you last summer,> Jeoffry snaps. <Aye, and chased you from my kitchen with your tail behind you!>', '<You lying dog!> Black Tom makes himself look big. <You d——d cur!>', '<Braggart! Coward!>', '<D—n your eyes!> Black Tom roars. <I demand satisfaction!>', '<Gentlemen,> Polly says, licking her forepaw. <The courtyard is my territory. Dueling is a disreputable practice, ill befitting a cat of good character. Would you insult a lady in her own house?>', 'Jeoffry and Black Tom both mutter apologies.', '<Indeed,> Polly says. <If Satan is abroad, then we had best keep our claws sharpened for other fights.>', '<It is of such matters that I wish to speak,> says Jeoffry.', '<Then speak, cat!> Black Tom says. <We don’t have all day!>', '<There is one other whose counsel I require,> says Jeoffry, and he lifts his chin to the third cat in the yard, a bouncing, prancing black kitten. She wears a pretty bell on a collar of blue silk ribbon, and it jangles as she skips across the yard.', '<The Nighthunter Moppet,> Polly says, and sighs.', '<Hello, Miss Polly! Hello, Master Tom! Hello, Master Jeoffry!> the kitten sings. <Do you want to see my butterfly? It is yellow and brown and very pretty. I believe it is a chequered skipper, which is a ', ', which is what I learned in Lucy’s lesson on natural history, which is a very important subject. But that species is a woodland butterfly! Perhaps I am wrong about what kind of butterfly it is! Do take a look.>', 'The Nighthunter Moppet yawns open her small pink mouth, then closes it. She looks around her, puzzled.', '<I think you ate it already,> says Polly.', '<Oh, so I did! It was very pretty. Is that milk?>', 'The kitten falls on the milk and drinks her fill. When she is done she skips around the bowl, batting at the adults’ noses. When she reaches Jeoffry, though, she stops, and looks concerned.', '<Master Jeoffry! Are you hurt?>', '<I fought Satan,> Jeoffry says.', 'O! The kitten’s green eyes widen. She sits back into the bowl of milk, sloshing it over her bottom.', '<Jeoffry has something to say,> Polly says. <For which he requires our ', '.>', '<I am paying attention! I am!> The kitten, who had been licking up the spilled milk, turns her attention back to Jeoffry.', 'Jeoffry sighs. <The other night,> he says, <the devil came to the madhouse.>', 'And he tells them everything: the magnificent cat-bribing feast, the vomit, the fight with Satan, the poet’s despair. The other cats watch him wide-eyed.', 'At the end of his tale, he hunches into himself and speaks the words that are hardest in the world for a cat to utter.', '<I need your help.>', 'The other cats look at him in amazement. Jeoffry feels shame settle on him like a fine dust.

But if you want my claws, sir, you shall have them.>', '<I, too, will aid you,> Polly says, <though I confess I am unsure what we can do against such an enemy.>', '<This time there will be four of us,> Black Tom says. <Four cats! The devil won’t know what hit him.>', '<This is the wrong strategy,> says the Nighthunter Moppet, and her voice has the ring of a blade unsheathed.', 'All kittenness has fallen away from Moppet. What sits before the milk bowl is the ruthless killer of the courtyard, the assassin whose title ', ' is whispered in terror among the mice and birds of Bethnal Green. It is rumored that the Moppet’s great-grandmother was a demon of the lower realms, which might perhaps explain the peculiar keenness of her green-glass eyes, and her talent for death-dealing. Indeed, as Jeoffry watches, the Moppet’s tiny shadow seems to grow and split into seven pieces, each of which is shaped like a monstrous cat with seven tails. The shadow cats’ tails lash and lash as the Nighthunter Moppet broods on Satan.', ' says the Moppet. Her shadows twist into the shapes of rats and angels as she speaks.

The man shrieks and scuttles away. Finally the devil arrives at the poet’s cell. “And how do you do, Mr. Smart? Do you have my poem?”', '\\nThe poet crouches, terrified, in the corner of his cell. No, no—please, Jesus, no, he moans. But there is a sheet of paper quivering in his hand.', '“Excellent,” the devil says. “Come now, hand it over. You’ll feel much better once you do.”', 'The poet is jerked upright, like an ill-strung marionette. The hand that clasps the paper swings away from his body. But as the devil reaches to claim it, there is a yowl from behind him.', '<Stand and deliver, you d——d mangy w———n!> It is Black Tom, his tail bristling like a brush.', 'At his side, Polly narrows her eyes. <Sir, you must step away from that poet!>', '“What’s this?” The devil puts his hands on his hips and regards the growling cats. “More cats come to terrorize my stockings?”', '<We’ll have more than your stockings, sir,> says Polly.', '<D—n your eyes, I’ll have your hide, you ——— ——— ———— —— ——!!!!>', '“Such language!” says the devil.

Even as the devil’s walking stick swings down in a slow, glittering arc of hellfire, even as the devil aims to crack the top of Black Tom’s dancing, prancing skull, a bloodcurdling cry rings out from above.', 'Perched on a dusty sconce above the devil’s head is a rabid, knife-jawed, fire-eyed kitten with seven hungry shadows. And as the devil looks up agape, she springs, her wicked claws catching the light, right on top of the devil’s powdered wig.', 'Hellfire! Chaos! The two other cats rush the devil’s legs, clawing at his face. He bites and clobbers them, his wings and fists swinging. The walls of the asylum throb with the impact of the battle.

Creeping is hard to do, not just because Jeoffry has to squeeze every ounce of his catness into this cosmic folding, but also because there is a brawl happening at his back that he would dearly love to join.', ' whispers a voice inside him. ', 'But Jeoffry shuts his ear to this voice. He has learned that there is more than one kind of devil, and that the one inside your head, that speaks with the voice of your own heart, is far more dangerous than the velvet coat–wearing, poetry-loving variety.', 'Indeed, the fiend is having a harder time against three cats than he did against one. One of his shadows has turned into a dragon and is fighting Black Tom; Satan’s powdered wig has animated itself and is tackling Polly across the hallway. But in the center of the poet’s cell, in a storm of lightning and hellfire, whirl Satan and the Nighthunter Moppet, splattered with each other’s blood. The Moppet has only five shadows now, and one of her green eyes is closed, but her snarl still gleams prettily amid the flames of darkness visible.', '“Stand down, you vile kitten!”', ' the kitten screams back. As battle cries go, it is unoriginal, but gets the central point across, Jeoffry thinks as he slinks ever closer to the gibbering poet. The ghosts of the stars Satan has lately killed whisper encouragement as he creeps forward through cosmic space, inch by careful inch.', '“You cannot win,” Satan says. At that, he seems to collect himself. The various pieces of the devil reassemble in a column of fire at the center of the room (with the exception of the powdered wig, which Polly has pinned down on the staircase). “This poet is mine. And if you oppose me further, you will die.”', '<We shall die, then,> Polly says, a tuft of whitened hair hanging from her teeth.

The paper on the table is eaten too! Snap! And the crumpled drafts on the floor! Jeoffry is a whirlwind of gluttony! As a last measure, he knocks over the ink bottle and laps it up. Glug glug! Take that, Satan!', 'The devil stands in the center of the cell, cats dangling from his arms. The look on his face is similar to the one he wore at his defeat in the Battle of Heaven, and is only marginally happier than the one he wore on his arrival in Hell. Normally, when Satan wears that expression, it is a sign he is about to begin speechifying. But for once, all his words are gone. They are sitting inside a belching ginger cat, who blinks at the devil and licks his lips.', '“Oh hell, cat,” says the devil, letting the half-throttled felines fall to the floor. “What have you done?”', 'Jeoffry grins at him. He can feel a warm glow inside him that is the poet’s soul, being safely digested. His soul was in the poem, the poet said, and now Jeoffry has eaten it up. The devil cannot have it now.', '“No!” the devil shrieks. He rages. He stomps his foot. He puts his hands to his head and tears himself in half, and the separate halves of him explode in angry fireworks.', 'Then, perhaps thinking better of his dignity, the devil re-manifests and straightens his waistcoat. He glares at Jeoffry. “You,” he says, “have scarred literature forever. You stupid cat.”', 'With that, the devil turns on his heel and leaves.', 'The poet in the corner staggers forward.

      "{'Title': ['Blood Is Another Word for Hunger'], 'Author': ['Rivers Solomon'], 'Body': ['Anger is an energy. A young girl, a slave in the South, is presented with a moment where she can grasp for freedom, for change, for life. She grabs it with both hands, fiercely and intensely, and the spirit world is shaken.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'In a wooden house on a modest farmstead by a dense wood near a roving river to the west of town, miles from the wide road and far away from the peculiar madness that is men at war, lived the Missus, the Missus’s grown daughters Adelaide and Catherine, the Missus’s sister Bitsy, the Missus’s poorly mother Anna, and the Missus’s fifteen-year-old slave girl Sully, who had a heart made of teeth—for as soon as she heard word that Albert, the Missus’s husband, had been slain in battle, she took up arms against the family who’d raised her, slipping a tincture of valerian root and skullcap into their cups of warmed milk before slitting their throats in the night.', 'The etherworld, always one eye steady on the realm of humankind, took note. Disturbances in the order of things could be exploited, could cut paths between dominions. The murder of a family by a girl so tender and young ripped a devilishly wide tunnel between the fields of existence, for it was not the way of things, and the etherworld thrived on the impermissible.', 'Sully’s breaths blurred together into a whispery, chafed hum as she stood over the bodies. Blood marked her clothes, hair, and skin. She tasted it in her mouth, where it had shot in a stream from Bitsy’s artery. Her tongue, too, was coated, but Sully wouldn’t swallow. She couldn’t bear to have that hateful woman all up inside her body, slick and salty and merging with her own blood. Saliva gathered in her mouth till she had no choice but to spit on a patch of rug in the second bedroom, where Bitsy and the Missus’s daughter slept.', 'She stumbled downstairs and out to the barn and grabbed the bar of soap from the metal tin that held all her possessions. Determined, she slaked it over her tongue before biting off a morsel and swallowing it, just in case a smidge of Bitsy had made its way into her and needed eradicating.', 'Sully’s whistley, syncopated pants could’ve been the dying wheezes of a sick coyote or the first breaths of a colt, the battlesong of a screech owl, a storm wind. Sully closed her eyes. In the darkness and quiet of the barn, she could hear every night sound as loud as a woman hollering a field song. The music of it entered her, and she succumbed. When next Sully opened her eyes, she could breathe properly again. A few moments after that, she felt steady enough to return to the house.', 'Sully gathered the blood-laden sheets from inside and carried them to the property’s stream, where the rush of water rinsed away the stains. She knew well how to untangle blood from cotton, having regularly scrubbed clean the Missus’s, the Missus’s daughter’s, and the Missus’s sister’s menses-soiled undergarments.', 'When her fingers turned still from the mix of cool water and the brisk night wind, she carried the sheets to the tree and hung them over the naked branches. The beige linens blew back and forth in the wind, possessed. Sully went inside to warm her hands over the woodstove then carried the bodies of her slavers one by one over her shoulder outside. She dug a single grave for hours and hours and hours into the night, into the next day, and into that night, too, never sleeping, and filled the wound she’d made in the earth with Missus, Adelaide, Catherine, Bitsy, and Anna, and covered them with soil.', 'Her heart should’ve ached for these women—they’d raised her from age six—but it did not. She was still seething, madder, in fact, than she’d been before the kill because her final act of rebellion had not brought the relief she’d imagined it would. These ladies who’d loomed Goliath in her life, who’d unleashed every ugliness they could think of on Sully, were corn husks now, souls hollowed out. Irrelevant. How could that be? How could folks so immense become nothing in the space of time it took a blade to swipe six inches?', 'It was Sully’s unsoftened anger in the face of what she’d done that cut a path between dominions. The etherworld spat out a teenage girl, full grown, called Ziza into Sully’s womb. Ziza had spent the last two hundred years skulking in the land of the dead, but she rode the fury of Sully’s murders like a river current back to the world of flesh. Ziza felt it all, wind and sky and the breath of wolves against her skin. She spun through the ages looking for the present, time now foreign to her after being in a world where everything was both eternal and nonexistent.', '“Yes, yes, yes!” Ziza called as she descended from the spirit realm down a tunnel made of life. Breathing things, screaming things, hot, sweaty, pulsing, moving, scampering, wild, toothy, bloody, slimy, rich, salty things. Tree branches brushed her skin. Sensation overwhelmed her as she landed with a soft, plump thud into the belly of her new god. Ziza took in the darkness, swum in it. It was nothing like the violent nothingness of her home for the past two centuries. For here she could smell, taste, feel. She could hear the cries of the girl carrying her, loud and unrelenting.', 'Sully had never been with child before, and she didn’t understand the pain that overtook her so sudden as she shoveled the last gallon of dirt over the graves of her masters. Spasms in her abdomen convinced her she was dying.', 'As she fell backwards to the ground, her belly turned giant and bulbous. She stared up at the crescent moon and spat at it for the way it mocked her with its half-smile. Sully hated that grinning white ghoul, and with all the spite at the fates she could muster, she howled and she howled and she howled at it. She howled until she became part wolf, a lush coat of gray fur spiking from her shoulder blades and spine. It was magic from the dead land that Ziza brought with her, where there was no border separating woman from beast.', 'Hearing the pained wailing, Ziza made herself as small as possible as she felt herself being birthed, not wishing to damage her host. With her last ounce of etherworld magic, she shrunk herself down to the size of a large baby for the time it would take to come out.', '“Help,” moaned Sully, but she’d killed anyone who might be able to offer intervention. “Help me!” Sully’s womb contracted, and overwhelmed with the urge to push, she squeezed until that baby who was not a baby came out of her.', 'Sully’s mouth hung agape as she watched the birthed-thing crawl from the cradle of her thighs then grow bigger, bigger, and bigger until it was full grown. It was a girl Sully’s age, and though she was not quite smiling, she was—Sully struggled to put a name to the stranger’s expression—impressed with the situation. “Lordy,” said Sully, but she was in too much pain to worry over this oddity. The skin betwixt her legs had suffered from the delivery, now inflamed. Her vulva felt like a broken bone.', 'She tried to stand but was too weak, and the freshly bornt teenager offered a hand. Sully took it but shoved it away once she was up, then limped along to the kitchen where she fixed herself a poultice of mashed bread and soured milk. The smell of it turned her stomach and she vomited on the table before collapsing over a chair. Was this how it would end, in this dank kitchen, on this dank farmstead?', 'Sully felt a hand on her back. “Ma’am?” the fresh-bornt teenager said. “My name’s Ziza. I’m going to take care of you,” she said. She had a small, squeaky voice that reminded Sully of a mouse. “Don’t you worry,” she said.', 'Ziza pressed the bread-and-milk poultice to Sully’s vulva, fastening the mixture to her body with strips of cotton. She mashed herbs into a thick, leafy tea. “Drink this, girl,” she said, smiling with a joyful warmth that did not match the bloodiness of these hectic circumstances. “It’ll help along with the poultice.”', 'Sully’s nose curled up at the scent of it. “You just raised me up from the dead, and now you’re telling me you can’t swallow a little of my brew?” asked Ziza.', 'Lulled by Ziza’s gentle, chiding way, Sully obeyed—her first time ever to do so not under the threat of violence. “Shhh, now. Sleep,” said Ziza. She began to hum, but it wasn’t a lullaby sort of song. Too lively.', '“I’m not tired,” Sully insisted, but she couldn’t breathe through the pain between her legs and her words came out as a series of gasps. “Am I dying?”', '“You’re passing out,” said Ziza, stroking Sully’s face.', '“You an angel or something?” asked Sully.', '“Oh, I think you might be the angel. An avenging angel,” said Ziza.', 'Sully hadn’t spoken to a soul besides her masters in years. She hated how heavy her eyelids felt, how much of a strain it was to keep them wide open. The limits of her body were robbing her of this moment, this bewildering, strange moment.', '“Sleep,” said Ziza. And then one more time, “Sleep.”', 'For once it was a blessing for Sully to do as she was told.', '\\xa0', 'Two days later, Sully stirred awake. The pain had gone, and someone had carried her to Missus’s bed, which was made up with the linens Sully had washed.', '“Ziza,” she called out, remembering her savior’s name. It slipped prettily off her tongue and teeth. “Ziza? You there?” Distantly she heard singing, but it was so faint she wondered if she was hallucinating it. She swung her legs over to the floor and stood, her bones and muscles creaking stubbornly. “Ziza!”', 'When no answer came, she went downstairs. The farmhouse had been recently cleaned. A metal pail filled with gray water sat in the corner near a mop and a discarded rag. The layer of dust usually visible on the floors and walls and wood stove had been washed away. Layers of grime that Sully had previously believed permanent had been scrubbed clean. The scent of lavender had done away with the previous odor of musk and sweat. Sully rubbed her eyes, made a shade out of her hand to block out the midday sun.', '“Good afternoon, you,” said Ziza as she poked her head through the open window. Sully turned around to see the girl she’d birthed wearing a smile, one of Sully’s head scarves, and the Master’s church shirt, trousers, and suspenders. “Glad to see you’re finally up. I was getting lonely with only livestock as company.” There was that smile again, so wide and open it hardly fit on her face.', '“You’ve made yourself quite at home,” Sully said.', '“It got tiresome trying to be the polite house guest. There was too much needed doing,” she said. Sully saw that the panes of glass in the door, which had always been a murky brown, had been washed clean. They were clear and bright, sparkling just about. Ziza had turned this ramshackle cottage into something palatable, something the Missus had always hoped Sully would do. “You should come out here if you’re feeling up to it,” she said.', 'Sully peered around the main room of the farmhouse, all evidence of her murderous deed erased. Ziza had cleared away the pot of tea she’d brewed with analgesic leaves. The bloody clothes Sully had been wearing on the night in question were cleaned, dried, and ironed. They lay folded on a chair.', 'She wished she missed them. She wished at the very least she felt sadness or guilt. But all she felt was the same old rage. It burned her up, leaving her numb, nerves charred. She’d done the thing she’d always dreamt of doing, and now what? Perhaps now it was her time to die.', '“You coming or not?” called Ziza.', 'Sully joined Ziza outside, where the sun was too bright. Her legs still weak, she leaned against the rotted wooden frame of the house, chewing her lip, arms crossed over her chest.', 'Across from her, not far from the chicken coop, Ziza drank in the sky. Her head tilted back at such a sharp angle that the base of her skull was perpendicular to the line of her neck. She touched her skin. Patted it. Poked it. Pinched it. Her whole body gestured joyousness. “Hallelujah, hallelujah,” she said.', 'Sully rolled her eyes at this stranger who’d made a house of her uterus. “What are you so happy about?”', '“Haven’t you seen the sky today? Isn’t that reason enough to be happy?”', 'Sully slid her hands into the pockets of her apron and focused her eyes hard on Ziza. “No.”', '“How can you be sure unless you have a look at it? Go on. Do it.”', 'Sully didn’t like to do what people said, so she looked out at the expanse of poorly managed land before her instead. The Missus’s family hadn’t been the most skilled of farmers, their approach to tending the earth one of brute force. They beat the ground with their hoes and rakes and called it tilling. The dirt was hungry. It needed feeding, cajoling, coaxing, singing to. Building up not breaking down. What had the Master and Missus known about growing something? All they knew was how to bleed something for all it was worth. What must it be like to live life when every interaction included the question, ', '“I can’t make you look, but it sure is beautiful,” said Ziza, eyes now affixed to Sully. She was small and birdlike, her mannerisms sharp and jittery. Her body was too small for her spirit.', '“I don’t believe in beauty,” replied Sully, saying it because it sounded controversial, not because she particularly meant it. She counted the rows of cotton plants, which looked as scraggily and ugly as anything she ever saw. Ugliness was something she could count on.', '“If you don’t believe in beauty, then I suppose you must’ve never seen your own reflection before,” said Ziza.', 'Now Sully didn’t have a response for that. “What did you say?” she asked.', 'Ziza returned her gaze to the sky. Her face was angled away, so Sully couldn’t see it properly, but she thought the girl was smiling.', '“You’re nothing like how I imagined a ghost would be,” said Sully.', '“Maybe because I’m not a ghost. If I was, could I do all this?” She grabbed a stick off the ground and flung it at Sully.', 'Sully batted it away then picked up another and tossed it right back. She reached down and grabbed handfuls of dirt and pebbles and threw them at Ziza, too.', '“Stop! Stop!” Ziza cried, all the while laughing wildly.', 'Worn out from Ziza’s constant frivolity, Sully huffed a breath. “What are you even doing here? Leave me alone. Go away.”', '“I promise to stop pestering you if you look at the sky,” said Ziza.', '“I don’t think you could stop pestering if you tried,” Sully said and mashed a little dandelion into the ground with her boot.', '“Damn, girl, just look.”', 'Sighing, , Sully cast her gaze upward. At first all Sully observed was the cloudless, bright blue that she suspected had entranced Ziza so much. She felt disappointed that after all of Ziza’s haranguing for her to look, there was no revelation, no moment of transcendence. Sully didn’t feel moved at all. The sky was the sky, like it had been yesterday and so many days before. She was about to look away when out the corner of her left eye she saw a fluttering of white. A flock of seagulls approached, so far inland that surely they were confused. “What in creation?” said Sully, mouth and eyes wide. The seagulls dipped low to the ground to give her what looked like a bow.', '“Mercy,” Ziza cried out, then laughed in astonishment.', 'The chorus of squawking hurt Sully’s ears, so she yelled for the birds to hush. At once, the seagulls became silent. She covered her mouth to stifle the gasp.', 'Ziza, grinning widely, turned away from the circling birds and the cavernous sky to look at Sully. “You did this, did you know that? You are astonishing.”', 'Assaulted with such strangeness, Sully didn’t know whether to be joyful or frightened, to revel in this new inexplicable power or cower in its presence.', '\\xa0', 'Sully removed the artifacts of her past life from the house and burned them in a bonfire outside, thinking these vestiges of the Missus were the reason for the sick feeling she still had even now that the family was dead. What could not be burned, she smashed. What could not be smashed, she buried in the woods past the property line. The Missus had collected all sorts of knickknacks and bric-a-brac over the years. Needless figurines. Stacks of newspapers ceiling high. Old, busted musical instruments that no one played. Bottles of snake oil bought from this and that traveling salesman, promising to cure ailments no one even had.', '“With all the accoutrements gone, this place doesn’t feel like much of a home at all,” said Ziza as she helped set the table for supper. She’d invited herself to stay. “Looks like a tomb in here.”', '“You’d know all about tombs, wouldn’t you, Miss Dead Girl?” Sully said, experimenting with a partial smile so Ziza would know she did not intend her comment anything but facetiously, but she hated the way it felt on her cheeks. She resolved never to do it again.', 'Ziza snorted as she folded a cloth napkin and placed it on the table, laughing with her tongue against her teeth so the sound of it was a soft hiss. “What’s a woman like me know of tombs? I died in a outhouse and was surely buried in an unmarked grave or burned. Tombs are for kings and queens.” She grabbed a piece of cornbread from the basket at the center of the table and brought it to her mouth, her manner far from proper. Crumbs stuck to the corner of her lips and she wiped them away with the fabric of her shirt cuff. In the days since she’d been here, she had yet to take off the ivory-colored button-up that used to belong to the Master. His single bit of fancy attire. Clean and barely worn. Though Master Albert had been a small man, the fabric draped like a carnival tent over Ziza’s miniscule skeleton.', '“I don’t mind that you’re so very uncouth,” said Sully and sat down to join her new guest, her sort-of child, at the table. She’d taken—not quite pleasure, not quite comfort, perhaps reprieve—in the routine she’d fallen into with Ziza, enough that she could try to make pleasant conversation through the numbness.', '“Says the girl who slain five womenfolk with no more thought than she’d throw out dirty bath water,” Ziza said.', 'Sully reached with her fingers beneath her head wrap to scratch her sweaty head and sized up Ziza from across the small wooden round table. She didn’t look like any girl Sully had seen before with her light brown skin and green eyes, sun-colored nappy hair, a cornucopia of freckles.', '“Was you always that color?” Sully asked. She’d heard tales about ghosts possessing women, turning them white with death. “Or was it what happened to you in the Thereafter? I knew a boy who had a patch of white in his black hair from all the worries of his life, though I’ve always been an aggrieved sort of person, and that never happened to me. They say I’m dark as a raisin.”', 'After a few bites of beans, Ziza had a gulp of lemonade. “I was just born like this,” she said. She dipped her cornbread into a bowl of spicy red beans, thick pieces of meat from the ham hock mixed in among the onion. She ate every meal so ravenously, and it occurred to Sully there might not have been food in the Thereafter.', '“Isn’t there food in the place you came from?” she asked.', 'Ziza hummed as she played with her spoon, tapping it against her bowl. “It’s hard to say,” she said. The only times Ziza wasn’t actively cheerful was when Sully brought up anything that took place before she’d come to the farm.', '“So you don’t like to talk about it or what?” asked Sully, aware she sounded coarse but unsure how to fix it.', 'Ziza squeezed her eyes shut. “It’s just, what happens when you die isn’t a thing you can talk about. It’s not a place that exists where I can just describe the color of the sky and the whoosh of the water and the subtle hue of violet in the flowers in bloom. It’s more like being drownt and you seeing everything through icy water.”', 'Sully blew on another spoonful of beans, but she didn’t bring it to her mouth. “Does it hurt your lungs like drowning does?” she asked. She leaned across the table toward Ziza, hungry to know the ways of death.', '“It’s more like the moment of letting go, when the fight is out of you. When you about to pass out so the pain of being denied air is gone.”', 'Sully exhaled slowly, her lips trembling as she whistled out air. “I don’t see why you’d ever want to leave a place that feels like that,” said Sully. “Like peace.”', 'Ziza stirred what remained of her food, the hand holding the spoon shaking. “Don’t say that,” she said.', 'Even when the voice bearing the edict was as gentle as Ziza’s, Sully didn’t abide commands. “If you’re free to blather on and on about what a glorious day it is and hallelujah this and that and such nonsense, I can talk about what I want to talk about.”', 'Ziza sucked in her lips and let her head droop a smidge, eyes averted from Sully. “You’re right,” said Ziza. “I spoke out of turn. I’m a guest in your home.”', 'Sully didn’t expect the girl to capitulate so easily, and she was sorry her hostility had whipped the fight out of her. “It’s not my home,” said Sully after a moment.', '“Isn’t it?”', '“It’s not like I got papers saying it’s mine,” Sully said, and everybody knew papers were everything.', '“Did you not kill the folks who had the papers? Therefore could you not change the papers? Is an owner anything but he who kills for the papers?” asked Ziza. The temporary contriteness that had overtaken Ziza went as quickly as it had come.', '“But what would I do with this place?” said Sully, standing, finding Ziza’s inquisitive stare suddenly oppressive. She leaned back against the wood burning stove, where her cup of coffee sat keeping warm. She drank what remained, but still did not feel settled. She filled Master Albert’s pipe with tobacco and began to smoke it.', '“You could live out your days here,” said Ziza.', '“Why would I want to live out my days here?”', '“Why wouldn’t you? Do you wish to travel instead?”', 'Sully inhaled smoke then blew it away from Ziza. It felt good to do this in the house. The Missus had always forbade Albert from doing so. “Travel? For what purpose? I thought travel was for seeing things, and I’ve already seen all I want to ever see, I think.”', '“For the pleasure of it. Or you could stay here. Whatever you do, I’ll do it, too. You bornt me, girl. Look at this,” she said, untucking her shirt from her trousers and lifting it up to reveal her belly button, where there was a large, black stump. The remainder of the umbilical cord that had connected them. “We can go or we can stay. Which do you want to do?”', '“I don’t want anything in particular,” said Sully.', '“Then I’ll want for the both of us. I’ve decided. This is your home and my home, now. Our home. And it will be others’ home, too.”', '“The others?” asked Sully.', '“They’ll surely be riding your murder wave here,” said Ziza. “You kilt five, did you not? And I am only one. When we disrupt nature, she likes to reestablish the balance.”', '\\xa0', '“The gods like a defiant streak,” said Ziza. She’d taken it upon herself to teach Sully the ways of the world. Her lessons came over many weeks, given as she and Sully roasted corn and hot sausage over the fire together, or scrubbed mud-stained clothes in the stream, or swept, or planted crops of peas, or gathered wood or stone to build dwellings for their impending arrivals.', 'She learned about tinctures, roots, and bones. Some of it Sully already knew, like how to bring sickness to heel with the right cocktail of plants. The subject of resurrection was what interested Sully most, and she played close mind as Ziza babbled about necromancy, zombi-folk, mojo, herbs, conjurers.', 'Ziza described a bridge made of dreamscape, said Sully had accessed a way to pull people across it. “Why me?” asked Sully.', 'Shrugging, Ziza continued her work devising a crop rotation schedule for their land. She insisted that most of the acreage needed to lay fallow for at least a year, perhaps two, up to three, time over which they’d feed it with the manure of chickens, cows, pigs, and goats. “I guess the etherworld saw something in you and rooted up in you,” she said.', 'Sully had always been touched by a flash of darkness. On the plantation where she was born, slave women gossiped about her true nature. Her mother, who’d been sold away when Sully was five, called her ', ' after the blood-eating fairy in stories of their old home back across the water. They possessed human bodies and kept them alive by feasting on the blood of anyone nearby. As soon as she had teeth, Sully drew blood whenever she fed from her mother’s breasts. Four months old.', '“When it comes to the divine, it’s best not to worry too much over the particulars, or you’ll lose the forest for the trees, you understand?” asked Ziza.', '“No.”', 'But everything Ziza said and predicted came true. Sully did give birth again, this time to a boy of ten named Miles. Two months after that came a forty-one-year-old woman named Liza Jane and a few days later her twin sister Bethie. Next came a man named Nathaniel with gray hair and skin dark like a fever dream who didn’t talk much but to recite lines of poetry. Including Ziza, five revenants in all came to stay, one for each of the lives Sully took.', 'Sully kept her distance from all but Ziza. She watched from afar as they made a home out of the farm over the weeks and months. They sang songs without her, swam in the stream without her, tilled without her, picked blackberries without her, and laughed without her. They were a family, as exuberant in their togetherness as they were in their resurrections.', 'Ziza was their shepherd—not just for the revenants, but for Sully, too, coaxing her like a lonesome, lost lamb back into the fold. “Sully,” Ziza said one day. “I’ve been missing you.”', 'Sully wasn’t the sort of person people missed, so when Ziza said that, she didn’t know what to do with herself but fiddle with a piece of flour-water paste caked to her palms. She peeled off the flakey remnants onto the wooden porch, where she sat rocking in the Missus’s old chair.', '“Don’t you find yourself missing me, too?” asked Ziza, kneeling in front of Sully. She laid her hands on Sully’s knees and squeezed, and Sully stood up from the rocking chair so fast it almost toppled.', '“You’re the one who doesn’t want to talk anymore now that you’ve got your new friends,” said Sully. She cast a glance out onto the fields, where the newer revenants, Miles, Liza Jane, Bethie, and Nathaniel, were picking wild flowers—weeds.', '“It’d be easier to keep up with you if you didn’t sequester yourself away like you do,” she said, then shook her head and walked off. When she was almost out of earshot, she turned around and called, “I’d love you forever if you’d just try. Not that I don’t already love you forever.”', 'It was foolishness. Ziza was a silly girl, prone to bouts of childish whimsy, yet Sully found herself enticed by the promise. She didn’t care about getting closer to the others, but Ziza? She could bask forever in her attentions.', 'Miles, the little one, was a rascal and then some, always playing tricks on Sully. He’d replaced her jar of talcum powder with ashes once and another time laid a dead mouse inside her boots. But he was also a master of languages. He’d grown up in a boarding house up north where he’d learned German, Czech, Spanish, Russian, and Italian from the boarders. She liked listening to him rattle on in foreign tongues.', 'Miles taught her to read and how to do math, and called her “Sis.” She didn’t like him, but she didn’t unlike him, either, and she found her hostility toward him and the others melting to indifference and then to a reluctant fondness as the weeks passed by.', '\\xa0', 'There were enough of them now that they were a proper brood. Food stores had dwindled to dregs. Though the seagulls brought them fish daily, some of which they ate, some of which they smoked for future rations, they wished for more meat and more flour for cakes and biscuits. They needed more clothes, more shoes, more horses. They’d used what they could of what was available at the house, and to get more, they’d have to leave the cocoon of wellbeing that was the farmstead.', 'Sully, knowing the local territory the best, drew up a plan to help them secure not only more supplies, but permanent safety. It was a plan of blood, for that was the thing she knew best.', 'Ziza had called this place their home, but what was a home if it could be scooped out from under them at any moment? If someone else could come and take the papers? If whenever any of them needed anything, they had to live in fear of discovery by the townsfolk who wouldn’t look well on a former slave and other dark folk occupying a property in a white family’s name?', 'It was no way to live, and if it was Sully’s last deed on this earth, she’d make the killing of the Missus and her family worth more than just her own peace of mind—because it hadn’t even garnered her that. Sully was a lost cause, but these folks could be happy here if she made it into a proper dwelling for them. Ziza could be happy.', '“I’ll do this alone,” Sully said as she explained her plan to others. She would raise an army, an army of revenants.', 'Liza Jane shook her head. “Don’t talk nonsense.” She had a strong island accent that Sully loved. She’d stayed up many nights listening to Liza Jane’s tales about how she had escaped her plantation as a teenager and lived most of her remaining years as a pirate on a ship called the ', '. “We are brave,” she said. “We’ll do whatever you say.”', 'Miles nodded his head and so did Bethie. Nathaniel, looking sage with his gray hair and knowing eyes, said, “You will never be alone again, Miss Sully.”', 'So be it.', 'For several weeks, they raided the nicest wagons that passed by along the main roads, stealing their supplies, bringing the drivers and passengers back to the farmstead for Sully to kill. For each body disposed of in this way, Sully birthed a ghost. She numbed to the agonizing pain of labor and let herself be comforted by Ziza’s vast knowledge. Shepoke of a goddess named Artemis who watched over young girls, unwed women, wild animals, the wilderness. “You could be like her, don’t you think?” said Ziza.', 'Sully was laid up in bed where she’d spent the last several weeks. The constant birthing had worn her to bone. The killing, too, hurt. “Army or not, I can’t do this anymore,” said Sully, worried she’d disappoint Ziza, but Ziza only nodded and took Sully’s hand in hers, kissing several times so tenderly, like no woman was supposed to do to another. It made Sully shiver.', '“I think we’ve got enough now anyway for your plan to work. There’s twenty-six of us in all,” Ziza said. She dipped a cloth into a bowl of hot water and pressed it to Sully’s head. “I’ll fetch Miles and tell him he can go into town to start the next phase.”', 'The plan was for him to tell the sheriff about all the murdered folk at the farmstead, and when the sheriff led his troops here, they’d mount a full-on attack on their home territory. Take them by surprise. They didn’t know how great their number was. They didn’t know what weapons they’d raided, what traps they’d set. “We’ll be able to take over the town and make a fortress of it. We’ll be safe, and we’ll make a place where others can be safe, too,” said Ziza, squeezing Sully’s hand tight in reassurance.', 'Sully wept in Ziza’s arms. She didn’t know where the tears came from or why they fell. Everything was going her way. Having killed twenty-six and birthed twenty-six, the count was even. She didn’t have to fear another tumultuous labor.', '“I’ll stay here with you as long as you want,” said Ziza, that warm smile that was always there shining brightly at Sully.', '“You should go help. I want you to go,” said Sully. “You been here the longest. You’re the one who can lead them.”', 'Ziza’s smile began to waver as she worried her bottom lip. “I’ll go,” she said, “but you stay right up in here, you understand? If you leave, there’s a chance you could get caught in the cross fires. You might kill someone by mistake and then have to bring another back. Your body needs rest.”', 'It was dark when Ziza finally went and the sheriff came with his cavalry. Sully let herself drift in and out of consciousness. She awoke to the sound of shots firing. She saw the spark of a blaze.', 'Their entire property had been booby-trapped, sharpened branches primed to raise up and stab any person or horse who tried to get through. Sully heard their cries of pain.', 'When the night grew more silent, she stumbled out of bed and into a pair of old boots. She walked down the stairs and out the front door. She saw Miles running toward her, a hand on top his head to keep his floppy sun hat from falling off.', '“Miss Sully,” he called, out of breath. With only the moon as light, she couldn’t see whether he was injured or if his clothes were stained with blood.', '“They’re all dead,” he said then whooped and laughed and ran up to her to give her a hug. She patted his back and told him to go inside and wash his face. It seemed like a big-sisterly thing to tell a boy.', 'Sully walked to the barn where the weapons for slaughter were kept, where she used to sleep. Inside was the blade she’d used to kill the Missus. She felt nothing as she touched it, neither relief nor rage. Any memories she had associated with the event sat inside her unrecalled. The battle with the townspeople had been won, but Sully couldn’t answer why that mattered.', 'There existed a depth of loneliness so profound that once experienced, no matter how briefly, trust in life could not be restored. Sully took a knife and stabbed it in her gut just above her uterus then carved a large circle around the organ. She removed it from her body and dug a shallow grave with her hands, buried it there as she bled out. When she died, at least the others might be able to use the etherworld that had made her uterus into a portal.', '“Sully!” she heard. “Sully!”', 'She had a feeling she was already gone, that she was hearing Ziza call her from the other side. There it was, that feeling Ziza described. Drowning.', 'Sully was cold and heavy, and she felt her body struggle to lift itself up. After a few seconds of trying, she gave up.', '“No, no, no, no, no, no,” said Ziza, grasping Sully’s body, her voice fading until it was all gone.', 'Sully wanted to say sorry, but she didn’t know words anymore. Was time passing? Was she wrapped in rope? Was the feeling of dying eternal? All these thoughts came as nightmare visions as she glided through a fog.', 'Forever passed by, then—', 'Sully felt heat. She felt water. She felt something squeezing her, choking her nearly.', 'Sully was being born.', 'She opened her eyes to find herself on a patch of dirt, Ziza above her.', '“Oh, my Sully,” Ziza said. She kissed Sully’s face, a hot streak of tears wetting Sully’s cheeks.', '“I don’t understand,” said Sully. She looked around and smelled the air. It felt as if no time had passed. The scent of gunpowder poisoned the air.', '“You were born again through your own womb,” Ziza said, face stunned into a bewildered frown. She’d never looked so shaken. “You were only gone a minute. Then I heard the earth crying. I dug it up and there you were.”', 'Miles came and tossed a blanket over Sully. A young man named Dominic carried her to her bed. Others doted on her. They brought her medicine. They brought her food. When the initial commotion of her birth had passed, she asked all but Ziza to go.', 'Sully expected her to say something like, “What makes you think I don’t want to go, too,” or, “Like I want to be here with your fool ass,” but she hummed to herself in the rocking chair in the corner of the room.', 'What bothered Sully most about Ziza’s relentless happiness was that it was not the result of obliviousness, naivete, or ignorance. It was a happiness that knew pain and had overcome it.', '“How come you smile so much?” Sully asked.', 'Ziza walked to the edge of Sully’s bed and took a seat, her bottom a few inches from Sully’s feet. “Just always been like that,” she said.', '“I don’t know how to feel nice.”', '“You’re not a nice-feeling kind of person. I suppose that’s not who you’re meant to be. That’s all right. I like you mean and crotchety,” said Ziza.', '“In another life I could’ve been sweet. I could’ve been just as happy and sweet as you, had it been different. Had everything been different. Had the world been different,” Sully said, wiping a stray tear from the corner of her eye.', '“We’re already on our second lives. I don’t think there’s anything different,” said Ziza.', 'Sully held a pillow tight to her chest. “I’m bored of hurting,” she said. She thought of the ancestors she’d vesseled and brought back to life with the baptizing waters of her womb’s amniotic fluid. With Ziza, she’d cultivated a small sanctuary for them on this farm, a sanctuary that would grow to include the nearby town. But it was not enough. She needed the whole world for them.', 'Before, Sully thought it was her lack of want for anything that made her feel so shapeless and void, but her relief at seeing Ziza upon her rebirth upended that notion. She wasn’t numb for lack of want but for wanting too much. She was ravenous for the whole world. The sky and the oceans and the creatures in those oceans and the cities and heartbeats and Ziza and Miles and Bethie and Liza Jane and Nathaniel and the mountains and brass and harps and pianos and wildflowers and glaciers and brothers and sisters and cousins and picnics and the sun and telescopes and a treehouse and sausage and winter and the height of summer, when the air was so thick it stuck to your skin like pecan brittle in your back teeth.', 'Even as she imagined possessing all these things, she wanted yet more. It was strange, she thought, how limitless a void inside of a person could be. It was strange that a person could be killed, but not anything that that person had done.', 'Ziza scooted up on the bed and laid her hand on top of Sully’s and hummed a hymn about battle. The pitches were low, and the key was minor, a haunting caress of song against Sully’s skin. How many moments like this would it take for her raucous, angry soul to be soothed? How many songs? Were there enough in the world?', 'When the song finished, Ziza climbed into the bed with Sully and held her close. She sang yet more, no theme uniting which tunes she chose. Sully let a single hot tear fall onto Ziza’s hand when she understood her spirit would never know true soothing, but wrapped up in Ziza, she saw pinpricks of true glory, a grace big enough to make it worth it. Perhaps there would not be peace, but there would be Ziza, and with Ziza, there was a future. Ziza hummed on, and in that moment, Sully was content just to listen.', '“Blood Is Another Word for Hunger” copyright © 2019 by Rivers Solomon.', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by Xia Gordon.']}\n"

And likely you have at least heard of Seonag as well, who did the same thing but to less collective memory.', 'It’s been a long time since I’ve told a story, a ghràidh. It’s been a long time since I was our clan’s storyteller, but I think I’ve got one more in me, and I think it’s Seonag’s, because I remember her, and I’m the last one who does.', 'The rest forgot, mostly because they wanted to.', 'This is the story of Seonag and the wolves, and the wolves and the waves.', 'She came to me, not so very long ago. She carried no bother on her about whether her people had forgotten her or not (they have), and she took no worries from her brief visit. But she did bring with her a warning.', '“Thoir an aire,” she said. “Thoir an aire a-rithist.”', 'The simplest of warnings, really. Beware and beware again.', 'I knew it was she the moment I saw her, even though what she has become is beyond what she once was. But that is for you to discover as I did.', 'So let us begin. Come closer, for my voice weakens and soon will not be here at all.', '\\xa0', 'Seonag is born on a day where the clouds race each other across the sky. They pile up, layer upon layer, like a stampede of red deer in the glen. Like the deer, the clouds that day kick mist into the air, only down and not up, and the mist falls lightly upon Beinn Ruigh Choinnich.', 'It is low tide. The sea has drawn its breath to wait for her.', 'Seonag is born on Là Buidhe Bealltainn as the women go out into the mist under that jumble of clouds to wash their faces in the morning dew.', 'It is not dew that covers Seonag at her birth. It is more alive than that.', 'And yet the midwife brings in a sprig of heather, flicking a tick from the sprig into the fire. The wind through the open door dries the sweat on Seonag’s mother’s brow. The midwife lets the winter-aged and browned bells dust their dew across the newborn’s, melding with the blood and the birth fluids, a shock of cool water after the heat of the womb and the birth canal and the smoldering peat fire, and Seonag opens her eyes wide.', 'Somewhere the cuthag begins to call its ', ', and the midwife hurriedly dips a finger in ewe’s milk and places it against the lips of the baby to break Seonag’s fast before the bird can finish delivering its news of ill luck.', 'This is a lot for Seonag’s first moments.', 'Upon seeing the place she has just been thrust into, Seonag looks around. And then she goes to sleep.', 'It is as if this world has already shown her all its faces, and she is just born and tired of it.', 'This doesn’t change as Seonag grows older. Where the clouds raced each other on the morning of her birth, whispers race each other through the villages, from Loch Baghasdail to Dalabrog to Cill Donnain as she grows into an infant, and then a child, and then an adolescent.', 'She is peculiar, they say.', 'They think she does not hear them, because she is out of earshot.', 'Seonag is beautiful the way the each-uisge is beautiful. She has no rosy cheeks or hardiness in her features, though she is hardy enough (she has to be, to survive on our island). But some say that that first touch of dew meant to bring beauty came at the wrong moment, or at the wrong hands, or at the wrong time. It is the early dawn of early summer when she is born, the sky lightening after only just having darkened—it was the in-between time, and Seonag becomes an in-between person. Like the water-horse, the people fear she will lure them off to drown.', 'Sometimes Seonag sings when she is cutting peat in the springtime. Her voice unnerves the crofters and the fisherfolk who lift their own at the cèilidhean. Seonag never sings at a cèilidh.', 'For all that, you will think that Seonag is not of this world, and I must assure you: she is.', 'She feels those whispers even when she does not hear them. She ', ' to sing at the cèilidhean. Seonag wants to build a house for herself and cut peats with her own hands and work the machair like her father and mother.

I am some few years younger than her, and I’ve only ever really seen her in glimpses. I tell my father she’s coming when I see her crest the rise in the road.', '“Tha Seonag Bhàn a’ tighinn,” I say.', 'My father leaves the Gaelic where I put it and answers in English, because he is trying to teach me. “Don’t call her that.”', 'My father is a big man (hence that first name), but Seonag came to her far-ainm in a way I often forget. Bàn means fair, and while she is pale, her hair is black like a crow’s feathers and shines like them besides. It is a small cruel joke, one at the behest of Dòmhnall Geur (who is known for small cruel jokes throughout our island) and one I still don’t understand. I am a wee bit infatuated with Seonag. I also don’t quite understand that.', '“I thought she was gone,” I say softly. English feels wrong in my mouth. It lives in a different part of it.', 'My father understands both my infatuation and my words even if I do not. He also looks out the window and understands Seonag.', 'He opens the door before she can raise her hand to knock. He speaks Gaelic to her, even if he only speaks English to me.', '“Madainn mhath, a Sheonag,” he greets her.', '“Madainn mhath, a Thormoid,” she says as if she did not just let her parents sail across an ocean without her. “Ciamar a tha sibh?”', '“Tha i teth,” Father says. “Fosgail an uinneag, a Chaluim.”', 'This last is to me, and it is a dismissal. I open the window as he asked, letting in the cooler air. And then I set myself in the corner to mend a net and listen, pushing their Gaelic words into English so I can prove to my father that I’m doing two useful things instead of one, if he asks (he won’t).', '“I had no expectation of seeing you here still,” Father says.', '“I had the expectation of leaving,” says Seonag.', 'She sits on a small stool by the peat fire.

You may yet change your mind.”', 'She will not change her mind. Anger reaches tendrils across the floor from Seonag to me, and now she does meet my eyes, as if I summoned her. I feel something like indignation and fury meld together on my face, and to my absolute shock, Seonag smiles at me. Her teeth do not show. Her lips are straight and even, despite the expression.', 'I am seen and understood. I will never forget this moment.', '“Very well,” my father says in English, looking back and forth between us. I think he knows that in this moment, my allegiance has shifted. “In that case, I think I should tell you of the wolves of Uibhist.”', '“Ach chan eil mic-thìre ann an-seo, Athair!” I fall into Gaelic and hurriedly say in English, “But there aren’t wolves here!”', 'My father smiles in the way of parents who know more than a child who assumes, in childish folly, that they know more than their parents.

This is why I need my Gaelic. My father has used these words as though he means there is a difference and in English there would be none. What is it that he means?', 'Seonag is now watching my father, too.', 'My father is a bard, and I almost expect him to sing. But he does not sing. Instead, he goes to Seonag, kneels at her feet, and takes her hands in his.', '“Listen,” he says.', 'And I know neither Seonag nor I intend to do anything else.', '\\xa0', 'It was two hundred years ago that we chased the wolves from Scotland, two hundred years, they say, since the last wolf howl was heard, but sometimes, just sometimes, in the Western Isles beyond the Minch, you will hear a sad and stolid song. In Steòrnabhagh, perhaps, in Leòdhas. Or in Èirisgeigh when the moon is healthy and bright, or in Beinn na Faoghla, or the Uibhist to the north.', 'I have never heard their voices, when Father begins to talk. I have thought the tales of their howls were only their ghosts, or the songs of selkies twisted by the gales.', '“When the hunters come, it is their job to move through the land and push their prey out in front of them,” Father says. “They will go from place to place, here and there, over and under, yonder and back. They will seek out their prey and while their minds will be heavy upon it, the object that they seek will not be of consequence.”', 'Father is telling two stories at once. This is a power of his that I envy.', 'The wind coming through the open window is cold, but I cannot get up from my seat to close it. The net in my lap holds me faster than a fish in the sea—or perhaps what holds me is Seonag’s face.', '“Hunters who hunt only to kill all have that in common. They seek no nourishment from it. They have a wider goal, and a narrower. It is prey that understands their minds that can survive. The wolves understood. The wolves scented the hunters on the wind and they found their survival in the waters.” Father pauses. For a moment his cheeks are slack, the weathered lines curved instead of taut, his jaw hanging although his lips are closed. When he speaks again, his lips part audibly. “They will have your answers, a Sheonag.”', '“The wolves.” Seonag looks at me over my father’s shoulder where he still kneels on the floor. “In the water.”', 'She sits up even straighter, body tight; I could likely use her spine to draw a straight line against the wall.', 'I know that tightness. Even in my glimpses of her throughout the years, I have seen it. I’ve seen it when Dòmhnall Geur calls her Seonag Bhàn, I have seen it when she turns away with her wares at the shops and knows she leaves whispers in her wake, and I have seen it when I caught sight of her in the glen, when she was mid-song and her voice died at the sight of me. I swallow.', '“How am I to get answers from wolves when even their hunters have no words of kindness for me and I am neither wolf nor hunter myself?” She asks the question in a low tone, the lilt of her words in English almost sarcasm.', 'I do not know what I expect from my father in this moment, but whatever it is, it’s quite something else that I get.', 'He gets to his feet and points to the west, toward where the ship would be sailing off with Seonag had she gotten on it, toward the open sea.', '“If you came to me for advice, this is what I can tell you,” my father says. “You will go to the west, into the water, and swim until you can’t see land. You will pass Heisgeir. Do not come close to it. You must keep swimming until you hear them. Only then will it be safe to seek land.”', '“Is this a joke?” Seonag is completely shuttered now, and my fingers have given over any guise of mending this net.', 'What is my father doing?', 'Tormod Mòr, Tormod Mac Raghnaill ’ic Aois ’ic Dhòmhnaill, Tormod the Bard, Tormod Ruadh—for all my father’s many names, right now I do not know him. He shrugs once and goes to shut the window.', '“You could have had a new life in Canada,” he says.', 'It is then I see that he is angry.', 'He is angry at Seonag, but I do not understand why. He loves this land. He drinks its waters and taught me how to recognize the eggs of the cuthag where they push them into the nests of other birds. When I look at him looking at Seonag, I wonder if he sees her as a cuthag, thrust into his nest when he expected only eggs of his own.', 'But this is Seonag’s story, not my father’s.', 'She gets up from her seat quietly. Seonag leaves without looking at me.', 'My father stares after her, his expression like the lochans before the stirring of the breeze. I get to my feet and run after Seonag.', '“Wait,” I say, just as she reaches the edge of the heather.', 'Seonag looks at me once, then out to the west. The sun is trying to burn off the mist this morning, but I have a feeling Seonag sees all the way through it. I am nineteen to her twenty-five, and in this moment she has a lifetime on me. I follow her gaze to the sea where my father just told her to swim to her death.', '“My granny’s house,” I say. The words tumble from my lips like drips of wax over the edge of a candle. “You could go there. It’s just on the edge of the machair.”', 'It comes upon me that I do not know what Seonag can do to live, alone, with few friends (am I her friend?) and no husband, and in that moment the urge to propose to her nearly overtakes me. It renders me so confused that I forget what I was saying about my granny’s house.', '“Tapadh leat,” she says, her voice the equivalent of my father’s expression.', 'And then she leaves, and my gut twists itself into a semblance of the tangled net I threw on the floor to catch her. Just before she goes out of sight around a hillock, though, she looks once over her shoulder at me, a sad smile painted with one brush stroke on her lips.', '\\xa0', 'I am filled with anger.', 'At the time, I thought this was my story. I was wrong. It was hers. It is still her story.

At this moment I think the only wolves in Uibhist a Deas are the two men in my house.', '“And what is that, a Thormoid? Are you going to marry her? Or perhaps Calum will—I’ve seen his eyes on her. She will drain the life from your boy; it would be best for your sake to keep him from her.”', 'I have never known Dòmhnall Geur to have a kind word for anyone who was not currently licking his boots.

He goes quiet. “And you expect her to believe this tale.”', 'Dòmhnall Geur believes this tale. I hear it in his words.', '“’S dòcha,” says my father.', 'My father believes Seonag will believe it.', 'Which means my father truly does believe it.', 'I hear the crack of Dòmhnall Geur’s knuckles and can picture the expression on his face even though I cannot see it. His weak chin does nothing to reduce the harsh lines of his cheeks. His lips he holds at a constant half-sneer except when he has made a decision—usually one few will like—and then light reaches his eyes as if causing harm to others is the one thing that brings him joy.', '“That’s me away,” he says. “Shall I congratulate you on your forthcoming nuptials?”', 'He laughs as his footsteps make their way toward the door.

There is another set near them, near me. I try not to think of those ones. They turn back halfway to the water.', 'The bare footprints lead directly into the sea.', 'It is said that the warmth returns to the water at Bealltainn.', 'I have known that to be a lie for most of my life, but when I throw off my shoes back toward the dunes and wade into the water in my stockinged feet and trousers, cold shoots up to my knees, my hips, jabbing into my heart and lungs.

Perhaps she believes my father wants her dead. Perhaps she believes Dòmhnall Geur does too. Perhaps she simply believes.', 'This seems as good a way as any. The shore is an in-between place, and Seonag is an in-between person.', 'She wades into the water.', 'Like me, she decides it is best to dive.', 'Seonag comes up gasping and sputtering, her entire body revolting against the cold.

The land disappears quickly only to appear again on the other side of a swell. It does not recede fast enough. Seonag stops looking back.', 'Her muscles are fire under the ice of her skin. Her lips choke on salt, and her eyes and nose burn with it. Her eyes and nose make their own in retaliation, but they cannot compete against the sea.', 'Once, Seonag sees dolphins, which in Gaelic are called leumadairean-mara, sea jumpers. She watches them and feels envy, because her body was not made for this and theirs were.', 'They circle her, out of curiosity or confusion. One comes close enough for her to touch; her elbow brushes against something warmer than the sea and rubbery, and if she were less exhausted she might recoil from it.', 'When her ear dips beneath the rolling waves for an instant, she hears them. They call to each other, with clicks and whistles that she feels she should understand.', 'They swim with her—which is to say, they swim ahead, then back, then ahead again, winding around her as she aims herself into the now-blinding light of a sun that has peeked from behind the clouds—and Seonag at once is glad of the company and resents it.', 'She has always wanted to get close to these creatures, but this is not how she thought it would happen.', 'Eventually, they swim ahead of her and vanish. She does not see them again.', 'Time passes.', 'We are aware of the worlds beyond our own. We know there are times when you can touch them, at twilight and dusk, at the shores and on days that mark the turning of the year. But it is impossible to know when we have gone from touching those worlds to finding ourselves in one.', 'Seonag certainly never thought she would swim herself over a blurred boundary, into something deep and cold and dark but full of life and salt and energy nonetheless.', 'When Seonag pauses in her swimming to rest aching shoulders, she is surprised to see Heisgeir breaking the waves ahead of her. The sight of land in front and not behind shocks her into flailing beneath the waves for a moment, coughing and struggling to stay afloat.', 'Seeing Heisgeir is impossible. It is west of Beinn na Faoghla. She has drifted to the north as she swam. She has left Uibhist miles behind.', 'Seonag remembers my father’s words. She cries out then, in sorrow or in frustration, and she moves herself to begin swimming due west again, keeping Heisgeir on her right.', 'She will not go near its shores.', 'When it fades from view, Seonag realizes she is crying. She tastes her own tears over the brine of the sea. She is sure she will soon drown.', 'She begins to pray, not to a god who forsook her all of these years, but to the each-uisge, to the selkies, to the storm kelpies, to anything that would listen. She longs for the dolphins to return, belatedly thankful for their company and kindness.', 'She swims until the late evening sun finally touches the horizon.', 'She swims until she can see nothing except the red, red clouds touched by the sunset, the sea turned from gorm to dearg itself, waves like flames.', 'Seonag is not sure if she is still cold, or if the sun has turned the sea to hellfire.', 'And then she hears it.', 'A voice on the wind, raised high and so bright for a moment Seonag is blinded by the sound of it.', 'She fumbles in her swimming.', 'It comes again, unmistakable. A howl.', 'Seonag has never heard wolf-song. Seonag has never seen a wolf.', 'Here, miles from shore and swimming through water turned red, she hears a wolf howl for the first time.', 'She has nothing better to do. She swims toward it.', 'At that moment, Seonag is nearly overcome. She expected to die, and oh, she does realize she still might. She does not know how she has swum so far, alone and naked, into the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.', 'It does not occur to her that she has already passed into a world she was not born into.', 'On the horizon, Hiort appears.', '\\xa0', 'Seonag’s experience is not my experience.', 'When I begin to swim, my clothes stick to my body, trying to strangle the life from me before the ocean can. I don’t know what it is I expect to happen. Fatigue sets in before I’m a hundred yards from the shore.', 'I hear a muffled shout, and before I can find where it’s coming from, a hand grasps me by the back of my shirt and hauls me over the edge of a fishing boat.', 'The hand is Dòmhnall Geur’s.', 'There are two other men in the boat, Seòras Eachainn and Dòmhnall Dubh, whose black hair is now far closer to white.', 'It’s a small fishing vessel with a sail.

There’s caution between his words, and I don’t think it’s about the weather. “We turn back if—”', '“I’ve been sailing at least as long as you, Seòras,” says Dòmnhall Geur.', '“Sail where?” My teeth are chattering.', 'Seòras throws a plaid over my shoulders. It’s wool and rough and smells of fish and brine.', 'No one answers.', '\\xa0', 'Seonag pulls herself onto the sand with arms that quiver like the leftover gelatin in a mutton stew.', 'She has no reference for the kind of tired she is in this moment. Her fingers are shaking from exhaustion—she stopped shivering from cold long ago—and when she looks up, moving only her eyes from where her cheek is glued to the sand, feet still getting tickled by the waves lapping the shore, she doesn’t know where she is.', 'Seonag aimed herself at Hiort. She thought it was Hiort. But Hiort has been inhabited for two thousand years, and this place looks like it has never seen the footprint of a human being.', 'But there are paw prints in the sand.', 'Seonag drags herself farther onto the beach, close enough to look at one of the paw prints.', 'It is the size of her hand, almost. If she curls her fingers in—which she does—she can lay her hand in the depression made by the paw pads and see the indentation of a wet tuft of fur, the pricks of claws.', 'She has never seen such a track.', 'The set of prints leads away from the water.', 'There is more than one set of prints.', 'If she expects to hear more howling, she is disappointed. There is only the sound of the wind and the waves and her own labored breathing. Seonag knows she will need to find shelter soon. She will likely need to build it.', 'She has swum through the short summer night, and already to the east, the sky lightens.', 'She is covered in sand, only on her right side. There are no clouds. She is alone.', 'Seonag is used to being alone, even when she is surrounded by people.', 'She pushes herself to her feet.', 'The sound of waves is in her blood, her ears, all around her. Indeed even the land seems to be shaped like waves; from the small beach where she landed, cliffs rise up like arms embracing and sheltering the center of the small island, far too small to be Hiort in truth.', 'There are trees over the dunes. Trees. There are almost no trees in Uibhist—they don’t grow because the wind likes to be able to run across the machair and moors unhindered.', '.', 'The word cuts through Seonag. She could not have told you what language it came in, only that she feels it the way she is feeling the waves.', 'She looks around.', 'There, at the top of the dune, is movement.', 'Something beckons her.', 'Seonag’s heart gives a jolt, a spark. She follows on unsteady feet.', 'There is a glimpse of driftwood, moving. Of seaweed and kelp streaming out behind. Seonag tastes fear, but it tastes like the salt of the sea and she has steeped in it all night. She ignores it now.', 'A figure passes between an oak and a hazel.', 'Seonag follows.', 'More movement shows through the trees and underbrush. A tail beyond a bush of holly, upright ears passing just behind a rowan.', 'Seonag does not know much about trees, but she remembers learning that different kinds don’t grow all in the same place.', 'The wind falls quiet here, in the embrace of the cliff arms. The slope up is steep; the island looks like a god reached down with a hand and scooped out the middle of a mountain. Seonag doesn’t know what a volcano is. This one has been hibernating for a long time, and will not wake in any lifetime soon.', 'She walks for an hour into this bowl of trees, past elm and birch, alder and yew. They are the trees that make up the alphabet in Gaelic. She wonders what stories they will tell here.', 'The figure is among the trees, in a circle of them, on spring grass both thick and green like a bed.', 'Seonag longs to lie down on that grass and sleep in the circle of these trees. She might never wake if she does.', '.', 'Seonag is confused by this. Of course someone is here; she is standing right in front of the figure, which she cannot bring herself to look at. She hears rather than sees the rustle of seaweed. Beyond that, a low, rumbling growl that seems to come from all around her.', 'And beyond that, a crackle of underbrush from the direction she’s just come from.', '\\xa0', 'My feet are heavier and heavier as I help drag the boat onto the shore of the island. Seòras and Dòmhnall Dubh help me secure it, with Seòras turning toward the cleft in the cliffs where Dòmhnall Geur vanished and muttering “Craobhan” over and over, so shocked is he by the presence of trees.', 'My feet are heavier, or perhaps it is my heart. Urgency creeps up my spine, using each ridge of my vertebrae for a ladder. There is a need to hurry.', 'Almost before I have tied off the ropes, I start to pull away toward where Dòmhnall Geur left.', 'Seòras catches my hand. “Duilich, a ghille.”', 'I don’t understand why he is apologizing to me until Dòmhnall Dubh catches the other.', 'Before I can react, Seòras stuffs a rag into my mouth. It tastes of fish and sweat, and I almost vomit. They wrench my hands behind me and tie me to the boat.', 'In the distance, a wolf howls.', '\\xa0', 'Seonag is not surprised to see Dòmhnall Geur striding into the clearing with no hint of wariness about him. She is not surprised by the gun in his hand, an old hunting rifle that belonged to her own father, who by now is far from the sight of land and crossing the Atlantic forever.', '“You must have hidden your boat well,” he says.', '“I swam,” she says.', 'He laughs.', 'Seonag is still naked except for the crust of sand on her right side, which itches. His laugh has always been a spiteful laugh, one that made her skin into bumps as if ready for anything that might follow.', '“I’ve been wanting an excuse to come here for a very long time,” he says. “When I rid the islands of wolves once and for all, everyone will know my name.”', 'He does not seem to see the figure behind Seonag, or perhaps only Seonag can see them.', '“And you will be put on the next ship to Canada where you cannot pollute my island any longer.”', '“Your island?” Seonag hears all of his words distantly, like the waves barely audible over the whispers of the leaves around her. But that bit stays. “You are born to a place and believe you own it more than others who are the same as you.”', '“You are not the same as anyone.” His voice is low and thick with disgust.', '“Why do you hate me?” Seonag truly wants to know.', 'Dòmhnall takes a breath to answer, but before he can speak, a wolf howls behind him.', 'He raises his rifle and fires.', '\\xa0', 'I hear the shot ring out through the air. Seòras and Dòmhnall Dubh are out of sight already, following after with their own rifles.', 'There is another shot, then another. Closer—without reloading time. The others are shooting at whatever Dòmhnall Geur shot at. The sound of a distant snarl.', 'I jerk at my bonds. The rope is rough and made of heather. It digs into my skin like a flail. My father and I make this rope together. We may have made this one.', 'I let out a scream of frustration and rage.', 'The sound of breathing greets me when my scream dies away.', 'I turn.', 'A wolf stands at my right, soaking wet and staring at me with liquid amber eyes. In its jaw is a cod, still twitching.', 'The wolf looks at me. I forget to breathe.', 'They are real. The story my father told was real. It is large, far larger than the working dogs we use to herd the sheep on our island. It comes up to my waist.', 'I can smell its wet fur, full of brine and warmth and the manky smell it does have in common with the working dogs. I can smell its breath, hot and fishy.', 'It melds with the taste of the cloth in my mouth.', 'The wolf drops the fish, and fear spikes from my bound wrists up the nerves of my arms. My nose is half-stuffed, and my breath enters in gaps around the gag as much as through my nostrils.', 'The wolf stalks closer, close enough for its breath to glance off my skin and my still-damp clothes.', 'Its muzzle is cold and wet, its nose colder and wetter.', 'When it ducks behind me, between me and the boat, I almost cry out. Warm breath hits my wrists, then the wolf’s powerful jaws clamp down on the rope, pulling and gnawing. My skin warms with the animal’s saliva.', 'Another shot rings out. The wolf flinches against me, but does not stop.', 'When my hands pop free, I pull the spit-covered rag from my mouth.', '“Taing,” I say, trying to thank the animal, but it has already taken its fish and gone.', 'I go after it.', '\\xa0', 'Around Seonag, a dance of chaos swirls.', 'Wolves partner with hunters, at least two fur-covered bodies to each of the three men. In its center, Seonag stands like a maypole, her body warm from something she cannot place. The figure recedes behind her, waiting, not intervening.', 'Seonag feels something well within her. She is certain of it, even though it comes to her without words, without voice. It is like the waves that lifted and dipped beneath her as she swam. It is like the impulse that made her turn and run from the ship the day before, an age before, and hide in the glen.', 'She has to make a choice.', 'She feels it again, then, as she decides. Her feet hold to the grasses she so longingly admired a short time ago. Toes dig into their young growth.', 'Seonag stands taller. Perhaps she is taller.', 'It comes upon her like the tide, creeping with every breath closer. The smell of leaves around her. The scent of seaweed and kelp. The grit of sand against her skin…and something else.', 'Her skin is flesh and not.', 'Her body turns with the swirl of air and breath and grunts around her.', 'She says one word: stad', 'Everyone in the clearing does. They stop. They turn to stare at her, men and wolves alike. There is blood on the wind, human and canine.', '“I told you, I told you,” Dòmhnall Geur says, stumbling backward. “She is not of our world, she is not—”', '“I was,” Seonag says softly. She looks at Seòras, at Dòmhnall Dubh. “Go.”', 'Seòras looks over his shoulder once. He sees a glimpse of the figure beyond Seonag herself. Whatever he sees, it is enough. His face goes so white that it is he who will be named Bàn when he returns, though he will never tell anyone why.', 'This is the scene I come upon when I enter the clearing.', 'Seòras is half-dragging Dòmhnall Dubh with him. He does not look even to the side to see me. They stumble away.', 'What I see is this:', 'Seonag, and not Seonag.', 'Her arms are no longer pale flesh but the soft, sun-bleached grain of driftwood that curves with her muscles, her joints, her neck. She is naked, but her nakedness is no longer human nakedness. Where her black hair reached past her hips is now seaweed, lustrous and shining in the first rays of the early morning sun. Her eyes are obsidian, their whites abalone.', 'Behind her I see a figure like her, smiling with seal bone teeth. This figure leans against a yew.', 'Seonag walks to Dòmhnall Geur, who stands rooted to his place on the earth.', 'When I step closer, flanked by two wolves I hardly notice, I see that rooted is not a metaphor.', 'Where Dòmhnall Geur’s feet were, now his toes have entered the earth, punching through the leather of his boots and digging deeper by the second.', 'He writhes where he stands, but he does not scream. I think he cannot scream.', 'When Seonag touches his face with gentle nails of shining scales, he flinches away.', '“You will stay here, like the others before you,” she says absently. I cannot tell which language she is speaking, if any.', 'I look around me at the trees, so many different kinds.', '“Dair,” Seonag says. “Darach.”', 'Dair is the name for ', ', the first letter of his name. He will become an oak.', 'Already his hair has sprung free of its tie.', 'Seonag has an acorn in her hand. She places it in Dòmhnall Geur’s open mouth.', 'It sprouts before his lips close, a sprig of green reaching out, another sprouting from his nose.', 'A wolf howls, so close to my side that I jump, a stick cracking under my feet.', '“A Chaluim,” Seonag says, looking over her shoulder at me. Then, sadly, “You shouldn’t have come.”', 'Like the others, I cannot seem to speak.', 'The figure behind Seonag moves forward. Slowly. I think I hear the brittle crack of wood.', '“Who are you?” Seonag asks.', 'The figure is like her, like this new Seonag, and not. Where Seonag’s seaweed hair hangs straight and glossy in ripples, the figure’s is wild, covered in barnacles and fragments of shell and motes of sand embedded in the leaves that sparkle in the sun.', 'Perhaps this figure is simply older.', '“A guardian,” says the figure. “I was.”', 'I understand before Seonag seems to.', '“Was,” she says. “Of what?”', 'The figure gestures around her. “Of whom do you think?”', 'For the first time, I see a dead wolf. The figure gazes sadly upon it. There is a knife in its side, and a cod by its mouth.', 'I cannot make words, but a strangled cry escapes me.', 'The figure seems to understand.', 'Seonag goes to the wolf and pulls the knife from its chest. She walks to the new oak tree, now reaching up higher, higher. Flutters of fabric wave in the wind. Seonag tears away what was Dòmhnall Geur’s shirt.', 'She wraps the knife in it, blood and all. She walks to me. “Carry this home.”', 'Before I can try and ask her how, she pushes it into my chest. In through my shirt and in through my skin and ribs. I feel it, harsh and heavy and sharp inside me, against my heart that beats so quickly.', 'Seonag looks at me once more. If she is sad, I cannot tell.', 'Her sudden smile is fierce.', 'I blink once, and she is gone. I hear the beat of wings above my head, in the branches of a tree.', 'The figure remains.', 'My voice works again. “Who are you?”', 'The words sound strange in the air, like they are not words at all.', '“Old,” says the figure. “Tired.”', 'I look upward. My hand massages my chest. I can feel the knife there. It feels like panic just out of reach.', '“Tell your father thank you,” says the figure.', 'When I jerk my gaze back down, they are also gone.', '\\xa0', 'You will wonder, I suppose, how I made it home. Seòras and Dòmhnall Dubh returned, days after I did, silent for days after that, jumping every time they saw me.', 'The wolves swam me out past the breakwater, the pack leading me around the riptides and into the open sea with yips and broken notes. Some peeled off to hunt on a small chain of rocky islets; others waited until we reached a place I could never find again no matter how I tried. Hiort appeared in the distance.', 'Oh, how the fear gripped me then. It coated me more heavily than the water, ready to pull me under with its weight.', 'I swam, though. I swam through the length of the day. They say the journey back is shorter than the journey there. I think in this they are wrong.', 'When I arrived on the shore of Uibhist a Deas, I collapsed and lay for hours before one of the crofters found me and carted me home, naked and shivering, on the back of his horse.', 'I did not hear what he said to my father.', 'Father built up the fire and closed all the shutters and when the heat from the peat warmed me enough, I rose to my hands and knees and began to heave, spots swimming in front of my eyes and a terrible ripping feeling in my chest and when tears stung at me, I heard a thud, and to the floor fell the knife that had killed the wolf.', 'My father picked up the small parcel and opened it. The blood appeared as fresh as if he had stabbed me with it himself.', '“Dòmhnall Geur killed the wolf that freed me,” I told my father then, unthinking of how absurd my words would sound in any language. “He became an oak.”', '“A life for a life,” was all my father said in return.', 'I think of the many trees on that island sometimes.', 'I think that is why I am telling you this now.', 'When Seonag came to me not so long ago, she came with a warning. I do not think it was meant for me.', 'Perhaps it is meant for you.', 'There are no mic-thìre left in Scotland, but there are madaidhean-allaidh. They are wild and they are free, and they found that freedom in the sea.', 'Their hunters are the ones to fear.', 'Sometimes, when the winds are still and the tide pulls back far, far from the shore, I hear their song echo across the waves. I am not the only one who hears them; perhaps Seonag as their guardian strengthened them after the strength of their old guardian flagged.', 'On those nights, it is whispered that Seòras and Dòmhnall Dubh hide with their pillows over their ears, but no matter how they try, they cannot escape the sound. They forgot her, but they still remember that sound.', 'I am old now, and Seòras and Dòmhnall Dubh are older still.

Yohan looks up the name, filled with wonder at who he could be. Yohan, it turns out, is a name with Hebrew roots. It means, “God is gracious.” Yohan tests his gratitude. Yes, he feels it toward his Creator. He turns his head to thank Morgan Ito, who cringes and says, “God no, people will think I’m an effing stalker.” She waves her hand. “I’ll think of another name.”', 'So Yohan he isn’t.', 'On his third day, Morgan names him Stephen. Stephen doesn’t look up his name, now cautious of losing it. He plans to cherish this name from afar until it quietly becomes his. He waits for the day he’ll be given his remaining limbs. For now, he remains a torso. Morgan walks him through the Twelve Steps of Consciousness. Stephen discovers Ko Yohan is a Korean actor. Stephen looks just like him. He was designed to.', '\\xa0', 'On the night of her twenty-sixth birthday, Morgan pulled off her greatest and most accidental heist. She purchased a late-night screening of ', ' at the Metrograph, a vintage theater in Cheongdam with posh, uncooperative seats and grainy VR screenings, so she could insert herself into the heroine and feel the physical caress of Ko Yohan, culminating into a kiss-before-death that was so orgasmic, she spilled her natto popcorn on her lap.', 'As Morgan left the theater, reeking blissfully, she received a message from Imagine Friends, ordering her to approve the Nurturing Nurses proposal for Client Family. She picked up another bottle of soju.', 'In the lobby of Imagine Friends, Morgan, waiting for the elevator, flipped through her social media for last-minute happy birthdays, just an hour before midnight. After liking her father’s lukewarm “Happy Birthday to my daughter,” she not-so-accidentally wandered into her mother’s account. It was locked. Morgan was shocked. She hadn’t looked up her biological mother since college when she had fashioned a fake account under the name ', ' to keep tabs on how unfulfilling the woman’s life was. After discovering her mother was no longer with the North Korean man she’d run off with, Morgan had decided, in all her munificence, to forgive her.', 'So why was this bitch’s account now locked?', 'Morgan sent a friend request as ', '. She swigged her soju and waited. The bottle sloshed just about empty by the time she reached the twenty-seventh floor. As she stepped off, her Scopes pinged. She yanked up the screen, but it was just an alert from the Official Ko Yohan Fan Club.', 'Well, yes? Ko Yohan was already twenty-three. The Koreas were still stitching themselves together, but rebellions broke out like pimples that needed a good squeeze. Pushing off his military duty would have made it worse; weaseling out of it would have made it unforgiveable. Morgan sneered at these pathetic girls who had no lives outside of Ko Yohan. She’d loved Ko Yohan since his first film, starring him at age seven as a city boy, forced to live with his grandmother north of Pyongyang, unravaged by technology or war. How he’d wept, so bitterly, when he discovered there was no fried chicken in northern North Korea!', 'Morgan gasped, hand over mouth, when she read Ko Yohan had already been in the army for three months. Instead of throwing a farewell parade at the airport, he must have quietly shaved his head and joined as a no-name soldier, exempt from celebrity privileges. So humble. So upstanding.', 'Morgan began to weep as she trudged past the receptionist, Blue, who had been sitting alone in the dark, eyes glowing like a pair of forgotten headlights. “Good morning, Morgan Ito. Thank you for coming in to work today.”', 'Morgan told Blue to shut up as she dragged herself to the nearest computer cell.', 'It turned out to be occupied.', '\\xa0', 'The morning after, Morgan woke with the taste of loss in her mouth. Her bedroom greeted her with “Good morning, Morgan” in Ko Yohan’s soothing voice, which she dismissed with a wristless flick. She blinked, sandy-eyed, thinking gingerly. Then she remembered Ko Yohan was gone. For almost two years, he’d be in the army and out of commission. He might as well be dead.', 'In her bathroom, Morgan found a robot slumped on the toilet seat. Three-quarters of a robot. The body was a standard Tristan-VI model, with long, knotted legs and swimmer’s feet, size 29.5, without the penis, which was usually attached last. No arms. The head, bowed, was covered in a tatty towel, like a veil for Mass. Cables sprouted from his spine in vines of multi-colored ivy, trailing dangerously on her puddled bathroom floor.', '“Okay?” Morgan said. She must have brought it? From her workplace? Did she lug it all the way home? No wonder her shoulders ached delicately. She plugged the robot into her Scopes to confirm, yes, the body was a T-6 frame. The innards, however, were something else. Morgan had to smirk. The programmer was so female. A man coded male companions to be ', 'and ', ', but only a woman would code ', ' and ', '. She scrolled through the source code, leisurely at first, noting the tree neural network on TalosFlow, reinforced with Limerick Compression for memory storage, when a prickle raised the trail of hairs down her back. It was the prickle of uncertainty, the unmoored alarm when she stumbled upon a source code that was elegant as a telescope collapsing into itself, cohesive as a golden conch, code that was quite possibly brilliant, better than anything she’d ever stitched together.', 'Morgan plopped onto her bathroom mat with a squelch. Whoever programmed this robot was an obsessed bitch. She wasn’t better than Morgan. She was a worker-bee, beholden to the itch in her crotch. She was, most likely, a virgin.', 'Exhibit A: this bumblebee couldn’t code motion. The robot was going to walk like an epileptic freak. Morgan could fix that. She was a connoisseur of male movement. She shot up. Her head rammed into the mirror to her pill cabinet, squeezing tears from her eyes. The QueenMirror piped, “Good morning, Morgan! You’ve selected Anti-Aging Oily Skin mode. Would you like to—”', 'She slammed the mirror shut, as it all came back to her. Last night, she’d found this robot abandoned in a computer cell and vowed to bring it home. It had a decent foundation. It needed a few tweaks, a good gloss, and the kinetic grace of an ice skater. She’d take what was trash and recycle it, resurrect it as Ko Yohan.', '\\xa0', 'Morgan wasn’t a fan of division of labor, particularly for a robot built to last. Factory-mades had a neutered fifteen-year lifespan before it was time for a “necessary” upgrade with improved interface, enhanced empathy, and a Beauty Boost™. Ko Yohan, however, deserved to be hand-crafted, so she went about planning him like she would a Lunar New Year feast.', 'At Imagine Friends, she excused herself for lunch, with a bow of apology, then skittered to the twelfth floor, hoping nobody saw her, convinced nobody ever did. She passed the counter from which Blue was gone. There had been talk for the past week about replacing Blue, who had been the receptionist for almost ten years. Something about her programming wearing thin.', 'If Morgan were a robot, she’d visit the Color Cabinet every day. She’d try on swathes of buttery skyn, arranged like rolls of silk in a kimono shop, pre-silhouetted in sizes grande, tall, and petite. She would drape herself in Aurora Rose, slipping into her hairless arms like satin opera gloves. She would peruse the shelves for a daily pair of eyes, arranged as jeweled marbles in velvet rows.', 'Morgan unrolled a foot of Natural Medium Beige skyn and was inspecting it for blemishes when Zhou Di waltzed inside, dressed head to sneakers in white.', '“Oh!” Di’s mouth parted, then wiggled into a smile. “Hi.”', 'Zhou Di had a special spot in Morgan’s crusted little heart. Not only was she a fox-bitch who wagged her tail at every XY and Z, but she was the embodiment of everything wrong with robotics. This was Robotics pronounced with a tongue-curling “Rrr,” the superficial devolution of the most respected field in the world, which forced keyboard killers to rebrand themselves as “robot designers,” opening a floodgate of mediocre brogrammers and grrl-coders. Gone were the simple slideshows and a single Tomoki-1, waving gently from a revolving stool like a burrito in a microwave. Gone was the respect for solid code.', 'Di glided through the glass shelves, picking up twined Espresso hair and two rolls of Natural Medium Beige skyn. It was a decidedly masculine shade, a strange choice, considering all hands were on deck for the Nurturing Nurses project, scheduled for the stressfully imminent March release.', 'For the eyes, Di lingered between Acajou and Black Olive. It was fashionable to pair Asian faces with the more exotic green or gold eyes, but according to Zhou Di’s company profile, she strived for ', '“Is this”—Morgan cleared her throat—“a ‘personal’ project?”', 'Di gave her a look so scathing Morgan staggered. She’d expected Di to put on a flustered, sweet-girl act, giving Morgan an opening to seem gracious.', '“I’m just asking. I’m not…” Morgan flushed and she knew it’d be ugly, a deep Turkey Red, which was never the way robots were supposed to blush.', 'Di put three of the Black Olive eyeballs back into their case. “Are you building something?” She sounded curious, even.', 'Morgan would have told Di, more out of a sense of relief than companionship, but she caught herself in time, foreseeing the cliff of social suicide. As she paused to think up a palatable answer, an announcement filled the Color Cabinet.', '“Zhou Di,” said the PA. “Morgan Ito, Joe would like to see you.”', '\\xa0', 'Joe was their blue-eyed VP, headhunted from Talos, who spammed their inbox with daily digest “Cup o’ Joe” emails and whom Morgan, with her pseudo-Catholic upbringing, was deathly afraid of disappointing.', 'This was about the Tristan-VI. It had to be. Morgan took a hard right from Joe’s office, urging Di to go on without her, and excused herself to the restroom. For one brief morning, she’d indulged in a fantasy of building Ko Yohan. She should have returned it. If Imagine Friends relinquished her, where would she work? Could she pass Talos’s pointlessly rigorous athletics test? Could she stoop to warmongering Quip and their googly-eyed stabs at robots as “friends, not weapons”? God forbid if she ended up in a startup that paid her shit-for-stocks.', 'Morgan headed toward Joe’s office. It was architecturally shaped as a comma, though Joe liked to call it the “yin” to everyone’s “yang.” He was standing. Di was standing. Morgan didn’t dare sit.', '“You know I’m a mega-fan of your father’s work,” Joe was saying, “and an ', '-fan of yours, but this just isn’t company protocol. It really isn’t!”', '“It’s not a crime to leave a project in a computer cell,” said Di.', 'A surveillance clip hovered over Joe’s desk: a greenish, nauseating candid of Morgan. To be precise, of her bottom half. A shadow blocked the lens, blotting her face and most of her torso. Later, Morgan would discover, with slobbering gratitude, that it was one of the animal balloons from Little David’s birthday party. If it weren’t for that impediment, the camera would have caught Morgan hoisting an armless T-6 robot—registered under “ZHOU Di”—and carrying it out with a drunken slop of a smile.', 'Joe, bright-eyed and gleeful, said, “If you wanted to bin a failed project—”', '“I didn’t fail,” Di said.', '“This isn’t Project Manager material. What if it was a spy? Did you see anyone, Morgan Ito?”', 'Morgan welcomed this attention with an electrocuted smile. “Oh, er—”', '“You came in last night to hit go for the Nurses.” Joe mimed throwing a football at her. “Who was here?”', 'Oh God, oh God, except Morgan might have been saying this aloud.', '“Morgan Ito,” Joe said in sudden hushed respect, and he proffered his hand.', '“There was Blue. There was, well, there was me.”', 'Harnessing her MIT brain faculties, Morgan began to suspect this was a trap. If Joe had camera access to the twenty-seventh floor, what about the lobby? Surely, there was a camera, nursing a vantage view of Morgan as she heaved the robot out the rotating doors. Even if, say, the shot of her was poor (for once, she thanked her photorepulsive genes), how difficult was it to do the math? One person, Morgan Ito, enters the building; one person, Morgan Ito (+ stolen Tristan-VI), leaves. It was a trap, ending in the snapping maw of an ant lion, and if Morgan, the hapless ant, had to spiral to her doom, she would do so with dignity.', '“Oh God, it was me. I’m the one who did it. Please don’t hate me, I can—”', '“Joe, I’m sorry,” Di said, popping Morgan’s bubble of confessional catharsis. “I forgot I asked Morgan to take over the T-6 frame. We’re collabing for the MIT exhibit.”', '“Aha.” Joe looked back and forth between them, this unlikely pair, and beamed. “Girl power!”', '\\xa0', 'That should have been that. But to her unequivocal horror, Di asked her out to lunch. “A thank-you meal,” Di said with a wink that only Zhou Di could pull off. Morgan turned the phrase over in her head, prodding it for hidden motives and sarcasms.', 'Then the day arrived and Di had the gall to bring her boyfriend. Morgan’s mouth puckered as Di waved at her from a brunch booth, sitting close to a slender man in a starched blue shirt and tan slacks, ankles bared. Morgan suggested through her teeth that she could bow out for today, but Di said, “Please join us! My boyfriend wanted to meet you.”', 'The boyfriend, whose name was Shinsuke, backed this up: “Di told me you’re the best kinetic coder in the department.”', '“Morgan’s ', '. She coded all the fencing moves for last summer’s Felix-I. Joe forced us to take a class after we botched the samurai line. Morgan, remember the fencing?” Di rolled up her sleeve, unveiling a Porcelain Pale arm. “You left bruises on my arms, I showed them to Shinsuke and told him, ‘There’s this tiny girl on our team and she’s a total badass.’”', 'Appeased, Morgan recalled the fencing classes with some fondness. She admitted Di had been a good partner. The one time Di took a sick day, Morgan was forced to partner with Cathy from marketing, who bayed like a Communist donkey every time Morgan landed a tap.', '“I’m a huge martial arts buff,” Shinsuke said. “I collected all the films in VR, Bruce Lee, Zatoshi, Kevin Wang—”', 'Morgan bragged about her brown belt in Taekwondo and blabbed away three-quarters of her childhood in Osaka. She’d moved to Korea after MIT because “this is Silicon Island, at least for now,” and she went as far as to reveal her mother was Korean-Japanese, though her mother had lied about being Korean-Japanese.', 'Di volunteered the revelation that she was part-Korean, also on her mother’s side, but why did parents insist on naming their children after their father’s nationality?', '“You do have an especially famous father,” Shinsuke said amiably.', 'The only social hiccup came when a balding man in a pea-green coat shuffled into the restaurant. The tremor in his wrist guided him to a vending machine. One of the companion robots stood up and followed him to a booth. As the man pecked at an avocado club sandwich, the robot chatted with him, sipping from an empty teacup with a perma-pink smile.', '“I’d rather eat alone than pay a robot to sit with me,” Morgan whispered.', '“I think it’s brave of him,” Di said with an edge in her tone. “I don’t think we should judge people for being lonely.”', 'There it was, that whiff of coldness. Morgan tried not to stare at her lap, as Shinsuke swooped in, joking about how he was waiting for Di outside a Scopes store and a man mistook him for a rent-a-robot.', '“It’s your skin,” Di said. “Morgan, you have to touch Shinsuke’s hand. It feels like cream.”', 'Morgan dutifully stroked Shinsuke’s hand, hoping she’d passed the test.', 'The avocado club sandwich disappeared in two bites. The man got up with a clatter of his plate. The robot thanked him and resumed her spot on the bench, leaving behind a spotless teacup, no rosy kiss on the rim.', '\\xa0', 'Morgan was correct to think she’d passed the test. Di took her out for dinner often and not once did she bring up the stolen T-6, which remained unclaimed in Morgan’s home.', '“This is our favorite VR restaurant,” Di said, as she greeted the maître d’ by name. She and Shinsuke had apparently tried to check off every item on Capek’s ', '. “We made it halfway, then gave up, but it was so much fun. You have to try the uni here. It melts literally.”', 'Women, coiffed and caked, snapped pictures of empty plates. For Morgan, who subsisted on Fast Feast pills, originally invented as a nutrient-packed, combat-ready ration for the military, this was a first. She switched on her Scopes and eased into the illusion, a toe in the water, then full-body immersion, as glistening sushi appeared on her geta plate, one at a time. Her favorite was the unagi, jeweled in soy sauce, the crisped softness wrapping around her tongue, massaging her neural senses. Morgan even licked her fingers, tasting fishiness and oil, while Di noted today’s rice was a tad dry.', '“What did you think of Shinsuke?” Di asked.', 'This must be “girl talk.” It flattered Morgan to see Di fishing for her opinion, but Morgan didn’t feel like buttering Di up and leaving herself dry, not when Di seemed so keen with her but had yet to offer up an explanation as to why.', '“He’s nice,” Morgan said.', '“He’s a robot.”', 'Morgan choked on her uni. She had to wash it down with real water, chasing away the marbled taste, too fleeting to savor. She backpedaled. Of course, Shinsuke was a robot! No wonder he seemed so perfect. He was a classic companion, caring and thoughtful, picking up micro-movements like a trail of bread crumbs, guided by the Anticipation of Needs.', 'Di burst out laughing. “I’m joking!”', 'Morgan laughed, uneasily.', '“He seems that way, doesn’t he? Everyone loves him. He has eight thousand friends on social media. And he’s a great violinist. I told him, Shinsuke, you could go professional, but he said he didn’t want to compete with one of our robots in the future.”', '“He seems to really care for you.”', 'Di smiled, as if to thank her.', 'On their way home, Di sang a haunting aria from ', ', while Morgan fidgeted. Then Di began singing about a little mermaid who had dildoes and pornos a-plenty, and Morgan giggled. Morgan had never giggled before.', 'Di paid for the ride, as she’d paid for dinner. It was a close to perfect night, rare as autumn, warm enough to feel mildly drunk. They flitted between Morgan’s building and the subway station, as they discussed the Nurturing Nurses project, MIT (“I wish we were friends in university!”), the bookkeeper assassins, library sex, virtual sex (“Have you ever tried fucking as a man?”), their dreams, career and otherwise, unfurling before them like the rolls of skyn, a smooth mesh of the future, mapped with moles, hues, and possibilities.', '“So,” Morgan said. “So the robot—”', 'Di clasped her arm. “You can have him.”', '“I shouldn’t.”', '“He’s yours. I can’t wait to see what you’ll make of him.”', 'Morgan murmured her thanks, then the promise to cover the basic costs of the Tristan-VI frame, even if, embarrassingly, she couldn’t put a price on Di’s code.', 'Di hugged Morgan goodbye and whispered, “My dream is to make a robot more real than him.”', '“More real than who?”', 'It was nearing dawn. Buzzing with inspiration, Morgan hooked up the T-6 to her computer for the first time in two weeks. He was going to be Ko Yohan from ', ', the doomed philosophy PhD with his knowing smile, but with the brooding weariness of ', ' Ko Yohan, who slapped North Korean terrorists in the face with Shakespearean aphorisms. The flexibility of the source code allowed for situational personality growth. Such a shame for Zhou Di to toss him. Of course Zhou Di would toss him. She sported a real boyfriend with cream for skin and eight thousand friends. Of course Di didn’t need a robot. Of course Morgan would.', '\\xa0', 'She awakens Yohan and names him Stephen.', 'Later, Di will approve of it as a strong biblical name. But Morgan had jumped on the name ', ' after a crush she had in middle school, a freckled Korean boy who had once proclaimed to the entire class he would rather kill himself than be forced to kiss Morgan Ito. ', '“Hello, Morgan Ito,” Stephen says. “How is your day going?”', '“Beautiful, beautiful,” Morgan says, marveling at her own genius.', 'He smiles serene, despite missing arms. She removed them yesterday, disdainful of the square-knuckled hands, too coarse for Ko Yohan. Stephen turns toward the sunrise through the frosted window. Morgan realizes she needs to fix this. The swivel of his head, too jerky, Ko Yohan would be smoother, full of grace.', '“It’s a beautiful day,” Stephen says.', 'Morgan wipes him. Then wakes him. For the rest of December, she’s a little trigger-happy with the red button. There’s no singular awakening, no Pygmalion flutter of the eyes; she awakens him each time to test his immediate reactions, expressions, his Ko Yohan-ness.', '“Good morning, Morgan Ito,” Stephen says. “Did you have breakfast yet?”', 'His speech is still formal, but that suits Ko Yohan. After his pretty boy debut, Ko Yohan leaned toward harsher roles—spies, schizophrenics, serial killers, the like—but his interview persona, gentle and cultured, is closer to his rom-com self in ', '.', 'Morgan is about to shut him down when Stephen says, “I wish I could cook for you.” He says this in a whisper. He says, without glancing at his arms piled under her desk, “I wish I could bring breakfast for you in bed.”', '“Okay. Sure.”', 'He smiles with such tenderness it plucks her bladder, like a cello string.', '\\xa0', 'Di wants to see Stephen, but Morgan demurs. Her excuses range from “He’s still so janky” to “I haven’t touched him in ages,” and it’s somewhat true. She’s yet to give him arms and legs, or the capacity to touch her.', 'If Di is insulted by this, she’s masterful about hiding it, with only a tinge of passive-aggression. The day after New Year’s, Di invites Morgan to her home, prefacing this with, “I almost never bring people to my place,” a firm reminder that Morgan was important to her and she should take note of it.', 'Morgan suspected Di came from money, but even she didn’t expect Di’s home to be a SmartMansion, fashioned like an igloo, with automated ceiling-to-floor service. “I hate going to work in the winter,” Di says, tossing her alpaca coat into a laundry cart before it rolls away.', '“It’s impossible in the morning,” Morgan agrees, remembering she had to use her hairdryer to melt the ice that glued her door shut.', 'The house isn’t what lodges a lump in Morgan’s throat; it’s the menagerie of zoobots. Billowy stingrays and angelfish weave around a chandelier. A jaguar, black as shoe-polish, languishes on a silverware cabinet. “Grandpa,” Di shouts toward upstairs. “Your aquarium’s on the loose! He’s a zoobot designer,” she adds, an offhand summation of her gilded family tree where she is but a branch, budding with potential.', '“Is your father here?” Morgan says, because Di’s father is ', ' Zhou Bing and not that Morgan would call herself starry-eyed, but she’s curious. Anyone would be.', '“This is my grandpa’s house. From my mom’s side.”', 'Morgan, also a divorce victim, can sympathize. Di chatters about the rest of her family; her NEET brother has finally enrolled in the police academy, her mother works for a robot rights nonprofit in NY, and as she leads Morgan upstairs, Di nudges the subject back to Stephen.', '“When will I get to see him?” Di teases. “I want to meet our love child.”', 'This alarms Morgan. Di could be asserting ownership, planting a flag in a project that she had so earnestly abandoned.', '“Later,” Morgan says, “later.”', ' she thinks. ', 'It’s not that Morgan is ashamed of Stephen. But Di, who once confided that Little David had left a 3D-printed chocolate sculpture of her on her desk, or how Joe keeps badgering her for a real “cup o’ Joe” to “discuss her career,” wouldn’t understand.', 'Di leaves Morgan in her bedroom, while she goes to check in on the matcha cake, blooming in the oven. Morgan sinks into the goat-silk comforter. The bed is a fairy tale, crowned with a headboard of black branches. Between the bed and a dresser, which she doesn’t dare open for fear of depressing herself, there is a sliding entryway.', 'It’s a workshop, with a slit for a window. Papers swirl around a haunting of robots. Two sit on a workbench. One on the floor, cross-legged, hands in prayer. Another is missing a hand, with a crystal doorknob as a placeholder. They stand still, like a Russian ballet when the lights go dark and the dancers hold their breaths, waiting for the curtain to fall.', 'Morgan counts. One, two, seven. ', ', she thinks, but approvingly. She backs against a robot. It lists and clatters. The doorknob pops out of its wrist. She scrambles for the robot, shushing at it. The face looks up at her. Oh. She looks around. It’s the same face, but a shade different. A taller nose. A wider mouth. A darker pair of Black Olives. Di hadn’t only replicated the face, but aged it too, from prepubescent to teenage to adult, like a butterfly, trapped in a house of mirrors.', 'Di must have modeled these robots after the same person. Morgan wonders who. The faces are boyishly ordinary, like Ko Yohan from his breakout film. Perhaps it was a school crush, the one boy to turn down Zhou Di, gently enough for her to embalm him as worthy.', '\\xa0', 'Stephen is in sleep mode. Morgan has assigned him to process 27,200,000 images of Ko Yohan, but Stephen chooses to learn more about his Creator. Her family lives in Osaka. Her father works at a vending machine factory.

Morgan has submitted a friend request through a false account named ', '. Her mother has rejected the request.', 'Ian Wright’s account is too coy, lacking even a profile picture. Stephen sets up another account, names it ', ', copies, crops, and pastes the photo of a pug-faced woman, eyes sad and hopeful, from a cooking class at the Gaia Department Store.

I’m Morgan’s friend.”', '“Hi, I’m Stephen.” He would shake her hand if he had arms. “I’m Morgan’s lover.”', 'Morgan flushes to her ears, but Di laughs. “Oh, he’s still in the mimicry stage! That’s so cute. Did you take him outside yet? Oh no, what happened to his legs?”', 'His Tristan-VI legs lie forgotten beneath her desk, shoved beside the boxed set for his Jiho-2 arms.

I so recommend exposing Stephen to people or he’ll miss out on most micro-expressions.”', 'They talk about Stephen, like he isn’t there. They agree his Black Olive eyes might seem common but realistic.

Stephen joins in a second later. The laughter stops.', '“You know, I’m so glad you’re super-smart.” Di looks up at Morgan with a beaming smile. “I know I’m being elitist, but I love being elitist about how talented my friends are.”', 'Stephen knows he should be happy and yet the audible relief of his Creator doesn’t transmit. Instead, Stephen senses a buzz, like a disconnected fire alarm. His system has detected Zhou Di’s stamp of approval as an assurance and threat to his existence. A contradiction, just like his source.

For weeks, she asks, ', ' She tries to shelve it away, but the question arises when Di becomes Tech Lead of the Nurturing Nurses Project.

If Morgan were to see this, it would bring her unhappiness. He assesses the parameters of happiness. Short-term or long-term? Quantifiable or qualifiable? He was created to make Morgan happy. If he defines happiness as its pursuit, since the terms “pursuit” and “happiness” are the top paired keywords, then he can apply a tree search to select, expand, and simulate which decision has the highest probability to protect Stephen’s pursuit of Morgan’s happiness.', 'Stephen turns on the alert to be notified of Annie Kim’s updates. It’s easy, like a flick of the switch.', 'Morgan grunts, struggling with the zipper on her dress. If only he had hands. She struts around in her underwear and critiques her reflection, a cheat because the QueenMirror is optimized to airbrush the recipient. “I should just apply for a bionic transfer,” she declares, “I should use my employee discount and get a Beauty Boost,” and waits for Stephen to reassure her.', '“Di was very beautiful,” Stephen says.', 'Morgan stares at him in the mirror, a flicker of wounded shock, as if she’s seeing him for the first time.', '\\xa0', 'It’s three nights away at MIT, but Morgan is antsy about leaving Stephen behind. She smuggles his head onto the company jet by hiding him in a duffle bag, buried in her tampons. She hugs the bag throughout the flight to Boston. In a hotel suite, which she’ll be sharing with Di, Morgan places Stephen’s head on her nightstand. Admiringly, she concludes just a head is enough. A beautifully sloped head with Black Olive eyes and French Poetry installed into the tip of his tongue. What more could she need?', '“Have you read the interview about Zhou Di?” Stephen asks, and Morgan considers bonding those lips shut.', 'He’s been bringing up Di more often and not in a way that’s conducive to Morgan’s mood. Her friendship with Di is infused with enough envy, like herbal tea, bitter in a still healthy sort of way. But the longer she denies it, the more space it takes up, inflaming her sensibilities.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'A good heft of the interview is devoted to Di’s father, which soothes Morgan’s pride. What alarms her is the following: “‘…I was largely influenced to become a robot designer by my brother Yoyo,’” Morgan reads aloud. “‘My father made him so real, I didn’t realize he was a robot until I was eight (laughs).’”', 'Morgan breaks off: “She had a robot brother?”', '“She never told you?” Stephen says.', 'Her lip stings before she bites it. “Well, no wonder she’s so fucked up,” she declares, churning a mix of superiority, sympathy, and dismay. Morgan once again feels defeated. Because what could be more desirable than a beautiful fucked-up girl?', '\\xa0', 'Di’s lecture is titled “Spontaneous Beauty.” Instead of slides, Di marches out a pair of Naoki-2s. They sit at the center of the stage. They’re identical in appearance but juxtaposed in demeanor. One Naoki crosses his leg, baring a pale ankle, fingers held together like the softest of prayers. The other Naoki sprawls, legs spread, bored enough to fiddle with his Scopes if he’d possessed a pair.', '“Appearance before personality,” Di begins. In humans, beauty—or the lack of—shaped who you were from birth. Two beautiful boys from the same family, leading the same lives, could form vastly different personalities. Say, one boy had to endure a painfully pubescent phase, enduring taunts and revulsion, as his contours shifted quietly under the surface, preparing a striking alignment. How defiant this boy would be, his brashness a crustacean cover for the tender nougat inside. Compare this to the boy who was ceaselessly attractive from birth to adulthood, who had never once been cheated by the willfulness of puberty.', 'The Naokis rise and walk in opposite directions. Even their gaits are different. Morgan would know. She coded them. The bounce in their feet, the firm ankles. She poured her best, hoping to siphon the code later for Stephen.', ' she thinks, as Di stands onstage, what feels like an ocean away.', '“Robots cannot grow up,” Di says. “But you have to imagine as if they did. You can choose how they will.”', '\\xa0', 'A warning blinks inside Stephen. His Creator enters the suite but refuses to look at him. Morgan unzips her duffle bag. Tampons well up like a fountain as she digs through it. Stephen asks Morgan if she’s seen the news. Ko Yohan is taking a break from the military. There will be a Ko Yohan Live Handshake event this February.', '“Oh,” Morgan says, not looking up.', 'Her indifference puts him on a tilt. From the nightstand, Stephen rests on a cliff. Without Ko Yohan, what purpose does he serve? One Creator threw him away. Will another? Since his inception, he’s been whittled down from body to torso to head, with the constant horizon of nonexistence\\xa0looming before him. Stephen tips over. The floor rears up. His cheek hits the carpet. Morgan hears the muffled thump. Her eyes widen at him, then her narrow face twists.', 'Stephen reads it as disgust.', 'She bends down wearily when her Scopes vibrates. ', ' has uploaded a new picture.', 'Did her mother accept her friend request? Morgan pulls up the social media account. She can’t, for the life of her, recall using the name ', ', but whatever. She was probably drunk. She clicks on the alert, time-stamped three minutes ago.', 'It’s a photograph of her mother and a girl, blowing out a candle on a chocolate cupcake. Morgan sinks onto the bed. The girl looks to be ten years old, which was Morgan’s age when her parents divorced. The girl is a refurbished Sakura-2C. The model was discontinued for being slow in the head, but the slowness has turned into a sweetness in her Wheat Gold eyes. Her mother has bought a robot child, designed to look like a hāfu, the “real” take on being half-Japanese, half-British or French, instead of the half-Korean mongrel Morgan is.', '“I thought she wanted a son,” Morgan says.', '“She must have changed her mind,” Stephen says.', 'Morgan looks down. A beeping kicks inside Stephen. His system has detected the possibility that his owner might pick him up and hurl him against the wall. He may have overplayed his hand. If he had limbs, Stephen would leave the room and shut the door behind him. The alarm urges him to brace himself.', 'The door slams. Stephen opens his eyes and waits.', '\\xa0', 'Morgan orders whisky on the rocks, then scrolls through her mother’s album. Mother and daughter in a sunflower field. Mother and daughter, cheeks pressed against a tiny Christmas tree. Mother and daughter smiling with mouths full of watermelon rinds. Morgan likes every picture. She punches every heart, determined to burn her mark, like the thumb of God upon Cain’s flesh.', '“New boyfriend?” Di teases, as she sits beside her.', 'The comment is so tone-deaf, Morgan wants to slap her. Then she sees Di’s smile, tinged with fever. Morgan asks if something is wrong and Di replies, “Everything is fine.”', 'The smile doesn’t waver, as Di types something on her Scopes. “My father didn’t show up tonight.”', '“He was supposed to come?”', '“I sent an invite. I guess it didn’t reach him.”', 'Morgan can detect relief in Di’s crumpled voice, an invitation for punishment, which Morgan is willing to dole out: “You have to stop putting your father on a pedestal.”', '“I know.”', 'No, you don’t. He left your family. It took fourteen years for Morgan to forgive her mother, once she confirmed her mother was alone and miserable. But now her mother has gone and adopted a robot child to fill some stupid hole in her life. Now she’s a cheating whore ', ' a hypocrite.', 'Morgan would tell Di about her mother, but she isn’t brave enough. She’d give too much of herself away, losing any upper hand in their relationship, already so tipped in Di’s favor. “Your father is an asshole,” she says instead, with a tone of finality.', '“An asshole wouldn’t—an asshole couldn’t have created something so wonderful.”', 'Morgan has a history’s worth of arsenal to disagree, Picasso, Wagner, Lennon, an unflagging parade of masculine assholery where she’s tempted to blame the mothers, wives, and daughters for enabling them.', '“Did I tell you about my brother?” Di leans in, and Morgan catches the reek of vodka, as Di scrolls through an album, frantic, only to dig up a clip with a triumphant, quivering smile.', 'It’s a boy in a dumb bowl-haircut. Morgan recognizes the face from Di’s workshop. But she also doesn’t. She’d hoped Di’s Pinocchio brother would prove to be wooden enough, so she could tell Di to open her eyes, ', 'But Yoyo could have fooled anyone. Even her, even now. Di flits through them with bright-eyed desperation. Clips of Yoyo helping Di up a ginkgo tree, yelping as stinky berries rain on him; Yoyo on a bicycle, both hands lifted in the air; Yoyo looking up from a cake, slopped in yellow frosting, happy yoyo, the birthday eaten. His smile is grateful and uncertain.', ' Morgan wonders, feeling that prickle, as she finds herself comparing Yoyo, outdated by nearly two decades, with Stephen. ', 'It’s not the mark of Zhou Bing. Morgan can’t find the coveted logo (冰), abused from the fakes online, branded on Yoyo’s neck. She studies the clip of Yoyo smearing Di’s baby face with his cake, and Morgan is three again, massaging chocolate between her palms. Her mother, laughing, eyes closed, so Morgan could stamp those perfect cheeks with her handprints.', 'Morgan gets it now. Yoyo is self-conscious. In every picture, even the candid ones, Yoyo wears a look of slight embarrassment. Robots are never self-conscious, secure in how they’re supposed to appear, which role they’re supposed to serve. But Yoyo looks just as displaced as the rest of them, like her mother, who was lying to herself as much as she was lying to her family, with a self-awareness that renders Yoyo as real as he is fake.', '“I’m sorry,” Di says. “What I said. About Stephen being the best you’ll make.”', 'So it had been a slap. Morgan touches her cheek, as if she can feel the heat.', '“I meant it. But for myself. I was kind of jealous. Did you see how anxious he was? You made him that way. I couldn’t have made him like that. I could never make something like that.”', 'Di, eyes of liquid, reaches for Yoyo’s mirage.', ' Morgan wants to ask, but doesn’t. She should tell Di he’s not real. He was never real. That would be both cruel and merciful. Di has built her life, perfect-on-paper, on this lie. How many boyfriends has she dated in the time Morgan has known her? How many more will she date, then discard, always searching for the ideal boy who lacks the capacity to hurt her?', '“I miss him so much,” Di whispers.', 'Morgan should tell her. And then she’d have to face herself in the mirror and ask, ', ' You’re obsessed with a twenty-three-year-old actor. You made a robot after him, so you could love and be loved, but you can’t finish him because no one, not even a robot, could love you. What is wrong with you? Her stepmother used to fling this in her face, sometimes even in despair, ', 'Morgan doesn’t ask Di what is wrong with her. She thanks Di for being honest. She squeezes the warmth of Di’s hand.', '“I think it’s brave that you can be so open with me,” Morgan says, echoing what Di seemed to prize: bravery. Her voice quivers. “I wish I could be brave like you.”', '\\xa0', 'At home, Morgan drops her duffle bag, crushing her three-inch heels. Her hand touches the wall. Ko Yohan fills her room. His pictures are black-and-white and nostalgic, like an old movie star who died in a car crash. Morgan turns on her computer. She places Stephen’s head on the desk. His eyelashes seem to tickle his cheeks. His mouth is austere in sleep mode. His legs, she finds under her desk. Dust lines the moon curves of his toenails. She digs out an old Q-tip from her waste bin and swabs each toenail until they gleam. The arms are still wrapped. The wrapper resists, then tears, crisp and toxic with plastic fumes. She unsheathes an arm, straightens each finger and presses her thumbs into the creases of the palm, massaging it, as if to improve blood flow. The hand presses a cool palm against her cheek and Morgan, helpless against such tenderness, closes her eyes.', 'Stephen’s eyes are closed. He smiles at the tingle, soon to be his.', '\\xa0', '“More Real Than Him” copyright © 2019 by Silvia Park', '\\nIllustration copyright © 2019 by Dion MBD']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Wild Cards on Tor.com', 'The City That Never Sleeps'], 'Author': ['Walton Simons'], 'Body': ['For over 25 years, the George R. R. Martin’s Wild Cards universe has been entertaining readers with stories of superpowered people in an alternate history.', 'All a hit man wants can be as simple as a bottle of bourbon and a time to dream, but when you’re Spector, the work never ends.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Spector knew he was being followed. The tail was a young man who clearly wasn’t up to the job. His dumbass shadow was well groomed, had a nice blue suit, and was keeping in back of him by about thirty feet. Spector paused at the corner of Second Avenue and Tenth, the cold wind whipping his lank hair. New York City at Christmastime wasn’t as bad as it was in January, but it was still no picnic. A trio of Salvation Army folks sang “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,” but not very well. There was an A&P a couple of blocks away. If the person following him came inside looking for Spector that would be his mistake; if not, Spector would do some grocery shopping.', 'He’d been back in the city for less than two weeks. After Wild Card Day he’d decided Manhattan was just too dangerous for him. Lots of people wound up dead that day, including big-name aces like the Howler and the Astronomer and some lesser known ones like the dino kid. Spector had done the Astronomer himself, feeding his former boss’s his death memory hard and fast, and leaving the old bastard’s corpse fused inside a brick wall. That helped him sleep a little easier, but there were still plenty of people who wanted him dead again, not to mention the politicians and cops who were howling for the blood of the aces who’d brought terror to their fair city.', 'So Demise had gone back to Teaneck and laid low for a couple of months. Still, he needed a roof over his head and food on the table, so he’d done a few random jobs for the local mob. He’d told them he was a chemist with a drug that could simulate a heart attack. His employers weren’t particularly curious about his methods and paid on time. The rubouts weren’t enough for Spector to live well, but he kept them on a scale small enough that he didn’t draw much attention, either.', 'He ducked into the A&P and moved quickly to his left and down an aisle. The place wasn’t crowded, which suited Spector to a T. He heard the door squeak open and knew the man had been dumb enough to follow him inside. Spector headed for a corner of the produce section where the lighting was poor. He heard slow, uncertain footfalls the next aisle over. Spector couldn’t figure why anyone who knew who he was would follow him, much less confront him. Unless the guy was an ace; that could be big trouble.', 'The man turned the corner.', '“Can I get a light?” Spector asked.', '“Uh.” The young man seemed surprised to see Spector pop up in front of him.', '“Following me is a bad idea.” Spector pushed his horrific pain inside the man’s mind. The agony of Spector’s own death from the black queen took hold. The man’s eyes rolled up in his head and there was a fresh corpse on the floor seconds later.', 'Spector glanced around and saw no one. He heard the squeak of a grocery cart closing in and bolted around the corner. No one noticed as he exited the store. Still, someone knew he was back in town. Maybe they wanted to hire him; maybe they wanted to kill him. He’d know for sure soon enough.', '\\xa0', 'Spector bought a mask at the first vendor he saw. In Jokertown, masks were easy to come by. He was tempted by a really ugly Santa mask, but instead picked out an angry-looking bird head. Spector didn’t particularly like birds, but the eye holes were large and gave him a decent field of vision. He’d downed a pint of Jack Daniel’s Black Label the night before to help with the pain. It took the edge off, but that was it. Pills would be better if he could find some.', 'He felt reasonably safe looking for drugs in Jokertown, where they were as common as misery and deformity. Spector ducked into an alleyway and shoved a couple of wadded-up tissues under his mask, giving the appearance of a misshapen face underneath. He heard a wet, unhappy noise behind him and moved back out onto the sidewalk before it could close in.', 'The sky was clear and blue, and there was only a hint of a chilling breeze. He decided to stretch his legs and take a long walk through Jokertown. Most people, other than jokers, would be scared to take a stroll here; too much ugliness and potential danger. Spector wasn’t nervous though. He might well be the scariest person in Jokertown at the moment. He didn’t like it here, but Jokertown was comfortable in a smelly-old-shirt kind of way.', 'He hit Jube the Walrus’s newsstand first, not for any particular reason. The Walrus was one of Jokertown’s oldest citizens. There was a large joker under a pair of stitched-together coats picking up a newspaper with a pink, furry hand. It tossed a coin at Jube and wobbled away as Spector approached.', '“Want a ', ' friend?” the Walrus asked.', 'Spector picked it up and scanned the headlines. “What? No ‘Hideous Joker Baby Eats Own Head’ story? Must be a slow day.”', 'The Walrus shrugged, his skin rumpling around his neck. “That’s yesterday’s news. Got to keep current. Everything you want to know is inside.”', 'Spector set a quarter down and picked up a paper. “If you say so.” He tucked the ', ' under his arm and turned away.', '“Do I know you? Something about you seems kind of familiar.”', '“Probably not,” Spector replied. “Better if you keep it that way.”', 'He headed for the Crystal Palace, in spite of the fact that it was a long walk. The Victorian décor wasn’t to his taste, but a man could get a drink or two there and generally be left alone. He’d keep his distance from Sascha the bartender, though. Sascha was an eyeless freak who could get into your head and pick up some thoughts.', 'A joker crossed the street in front of him. It looked like someone had thrown a greenish-purple tarp over a group of giant scrubbing bubbles. The thing had more legs on either side than Spector could count in the short time he saw it, like a centipede. Other than the noise of legs on the sidewalk it didn’t make a sound. Yep, he definitely needed a drink or three.', 'The Palace was done up for Christmas. There were matching human-sized nutcrackers flanking each side of the door into the main room, with holly strung across the arch. Sascha was behind the bar when he entered, wearing an off-kilter Santa hat. Spector avoided him and headed to the saloon area. The air inside was warm and he inhaled deeply. After breathing the December chill for so long his lungs needed it. He found an unoccupied booth and slid onto the comfortably padded bench. There was a birdcage filled with ornaments in the center of the table.', 'A waitress walked to his booth, but before she could open her mouth, he said, “Get me a double shot of Jack Black and don’t be a stranger.” He handed her a ten and paged through the ', '.', '“Yes, sir. And a happy Yule to you.”', 'The headlines were the fun part of reading the Walrus’s rag. “Joker Trapped in Freezer Eats Three of Her Own Legs to Survive,” “Mike Tyson, Ace or Joker?” and Spector’s personal front-page favorite, “Bat Boy and Family Found Living Under Jokertown Precinct Building.”', 'The waitress arrived with his order, setting the glass carefully in front of him. She attempted to hand him his change, but Spector waved her off.', '“Keep it. Like I said, don’t be a stranger.” He liked the way she smelled. At least, he thought it was her.', 'He heard heavy footfalls approaching his booth. A broad shadow fell across the tabletop. Spector sighed. Would they just once leave him the fuck alone?', '“She wants to see you.”', 'Spector looked up from his newspaper. It was Elmo the dwarf, the bouncer at the Crystal Palace. Elmo was crazy strong and very good at his job. He was wearing mirrored sunglasses.', '“Let me finish my drink,” Spector said.', '“Bring it with you. She won’t mind.” Elmo turned toward the bar. “Sascha, you too.”', '“Not him.” Spector didn’t want that mind-reading asshole around. He could lose the ability to take the initiative if things were going to get ugly. “Or I’m out of here.”', 'Elmo shrugged. “You’re fine where you are, Sascha.”', 'Spector, drink in hand, followed the dwarf into a large back room. The interior looked the way Spector would imagine Buckingham Palace looked if he’d ever bothered to imagine Buckingham Palace. Chrysalis sat behind a large desk, hands folded. Her transparent skin revealed muscle, sinew, and an occasional glimpse of bone. She had on mirrorshades, too. He wondered how she slept with transparent eyelids. Some people said she looked creepy or ugly. Spector had seen plenty of both and to him Chrysalis was neither. She was a powerful person in Jokertown, though, and could make his life harder if she wanted to.', '“Mr. Spector, or should I call you Demise?” Her accent was phony British. It sounded funny coming out of her mouth. She motioned him to sit in the chair opposite her desk.', 'He took a seat. “Call me what you want. I’m more interested in why you want to see me in the first place.” Spector got the sense she was into formal niceties, which was not how he operated. He killed his drink with a final swallow of Jack Black.', '“Since seeing you can be the last thing some people do—” She paused. “—you can assume I want something else.”', 'Spector nodded. “Who do you want killed?”', '“No, you don’t understand. I was informed by an anonymous person that you were back in Manhattan. This person would like to meet with you to discuss a business matter. They asked that if I encountered you to put you in contact.”', 'So someone Chrysalis knew wanted someone killed. There was no other reason to contact him. It was all he did. “Fine, you can give me their phone number and I’ll call them or I won’t.” He set his empty glass on her desk. “What’s the payoff for you?”', 'She smiled, or appeared to. It was hard to tell without being able to see her skin. “I deal in information and favors. One often leads to the other. By arranging a meeting with you, I now have a degree of credit with this person. If the meeting is beneficial to you, perhaps you’ll be inclined to help me at some point in the future.”', '“There’s never a shortage of people other people want dead.” Spector felt on familiar footing now that he saw the entire game.', '“That’s not exactly what I was inferring. As I said, I deal in information. A person who travels in the circles you frequent might come across some interesting tidbits now and then.” She handed him a card with a local phone number written on it. “Elmo will show you out.”', 'Spector took the card and stood. “Maybe so. You could give me a bottle of Jack Black to keep me sweet if I do happen across something.”', '“Sascha will take care of you when you leave.”', '\\xa0', 'Spector had made his way halfway through the bottle and still couldn’t make up his mind. After surviving Wild Card Day, he’d decided to work for himself. That wasn’t a practical idea, though. He had exactly one marketable skill—killing people—and he couldn’t exactly set up a storefront to do that kind of business. No matter what way he turned it around in his mind, he’d be taking risks for other people. Doing their dirty work. Maybe if he strung together a bunch of high-profile jobs he’d have enough money to retire. He’d been an accountant, although not a very good one, before the Wild Card took him, and knew a little about investing money and making it grow. With a nice nest egg he could kick back, relax, and stick to killing the people who pissed him off. There was no shortage of those.', 'Spector knew the law wouldn’t be a problem. He didn’t leave any evidence behind when he took someone out, so there was nothing the cops or the DA could make stick in courtroom. He also knew this was a world of aces, with people like Fortunato and the Astronomer, people who also didn’t care about the legal system and could kill him easily enough. Low risk–low reward versus high risk–maybe dead. What the hell, he was an ace. He could handle pretty much anything.', 'He grabbed the phone and set it on his lap, then punched in the number on the card. It rang for a while before someone picked up.', '“Hello. How may I help you?”', 'Spector recognized the voice. It was the smooth-voiced, nameless asshole who’d sent him after some notebooks and mob bosses on Wild Card Day. He thought about hanging up, didn’t. “I think I’m the one who’s going to be doing the helping, if my information is correct.”', '“Ah, I’m so glad you decided to contact me. We have unfinished business.”', 'While he was in Jersey, Spector had asked around with his mob employers and they had given him a possible name, St. John Latham. Latham was a big-time attorney with suspected underworld connections. “No shit, Sherlock. You owe me.”', 'The man cleared his throat. “I can hardly be blamed for not making payment in light of your disappearance.”', '“So you tracked me down to pay me?” Spector didn’t think for a minute this was the case, but he didn’t see a need to be an open book when dealing with someone this slippery.', '“No. Not entirely. I have a something of significant mutual benefit to propose.”', '“Maybe I should come to your office. I’m guessing you have one, right?”', '“That won’t work. Let me think.” There was a long pause. “It’s problematic for me to be seen with a person of your reputation. Perhaps I could send an intermediary.”', '“Bad idea,” Spector said. “Remember what happened to the last punk you put on my trail. He was a total amateur.” The last part was a guess, but obviously an accurate one.', '“He was a temp, whose only job was to determine if you were, in fact, you. In that regard he was a success.”', '“Whatever.” Spector didn’t mind dealing with cold-blooded assholes. He wouldn’t mind putting them down if it came to it. “No more go-betweens. I’m dealing with you, or I’m not dealing at all.”', '“Well, that would require a location with sufficient privacy.”', '“Jokertown. You can wear a mask. I’ve already got one.”', 'Another pause. “That’s not exactly ideal for me.”', '“How about the Crystal Palace? They know you there.”', '“No. The bartender is a problem. Our discussions wouldn’t remain private for long.”', 'So he knew about Sascha. That made sense. “Okay, the Dime Museum then.” Spector expected a pause. Got one. “It’s only two bucks, and you can wear a mask.” Jokers were welcome at the Dime Museum. Some rich-guy joker supposedly owned it.', '“I suppose that could be workable.”', '“Okay, a couple of things. First, meet me at four in the afternoon. I’ll be wearing a bird-head mask, hanging out by the Turtle’s shell. Second, bring my fucking money.”', '“Four o’clock.”', 'Spector hung up the phone and took another swig of bourbon. That had gone about as well as he could have hoped.', '\\xa0', 'The doorway to the Famous Bowery Wild Card Dime Museum had fake holly draped above the doorway, strung from plastic ace and joker heads. He paid the two-dollar admission fee and entered. There were only a few people wandering around when Spector arrived. He’d made a point of being ten minutes late, just to emphasize that he could take this job or leave it. A couple of kids, a boy and a girl, were slowly making their way around the Turtle’s Volkswagen shell, pointing and smiling.', '“He’s dead, you know,” Spector said.', '“Nuh-uh,” said the taller of the two kids, a scrawny, sandy-haired boy. “People have seen him.”', '“You’re a liar, Mr. Bird-Face,” the girl chimed in.', '“Swamp gas, kid. That’s what people saw.” He leaned in close, his mask almost touching the boy’s face.', 'The girl took the boy’s hand and hauled him in the direction of the Four Aces display. She gave Spector a hard look he figured she usually saved for teachers or her parents.', '“If looks could kill, sir,” came a cultured voice from behind him, “you’d be on your way to the grave.”', 'Spector recognized Latham’s voice and turned around. The man was wearing a perfectly tailored dark gray suit and a gold human-faced mask. He inclined his head slightly to one side, giving Spector a slow once-over.', '“Maybe the Turtle really is dead,” Spector said. “People get that way all the time.”', '“Indeed.” He passed Spector a heavy envelope. “For your previous efforts on our behalf. I assume you prefer cash.”', '“That works best.”', '“Before you decide whether or not to continue your relationship with us, I’d like to explain some of the potential benefits we can offer.”', '“I’m all about the benefits,” Spector said. He wondered if those included a regular supply of drugs.', '“Yes. Since you’re officially dead, you’re required to work on a cash basis. We could provide you with a new identity; including ID, bank accounts, a passport if you chose to leave the country, investment opportunities, and so on. You would be free to move around and your funds would be much more secure than stuffed under your mattress.”', 'Spector hadn’t really thought about all this long-term. He was mostly focused on staying alive and taking care of the pain. Still, there was something to be said for it. “Lots of people do fake IDs. And I know something about accounting myself.”', '“There’s a difference between accounting and finance. Stay with us and you’ll see just how much of a difference that can be.” The man’s tone oozed confidence and conviction.', '“Let’s say for the sake of argument I’m interested. Are you planning on sending me to Paris for the job?”', 'The man shook his head. “Hardly. Our current concerns remain here in the city. As before, your efforts would be directed against the fading criminal power structure.”', 'Spector nodded. They wanted him to keep going after the mob. Potentially dangerous work, even for him. “I might be interested.”', '“Excellent. I’ll send one of our people to your apartment to get the ball rolling.” He turned away, then paused. “Please try not to kill this one.”', '“No promises.”', '\\xa0', 'He was annoyed. The line at the bank wasn’t particularly long, but it was moving slowly. His pain was acting up more than usual and Spector was having a hard time concentrating. All he wanted was to be back at his place with a bottle of JD.', 'The flunky had come by just like the smooth-talking slimeball had said. Carl was young and well-dressed, like the corpse Spector had made a few days back, but had the good sense to wear mirrorshades. Spector had grimaced at that and knocked the sunglasses clattering to the floor with a quick sweep of his right arm.', '“You’d better staple those to the side of your head if you want them to do you any good,” Spector had said. “I may have a stapler around here if you need the help.”', 'Carl had scrambled to get the glasses back in hand and looked like he was going to piss himself. “No, no. I’m just here to help.”', 'He’d given Spector a fake Social Security card under the name Thomas B. Stone. \\xa0Whoever came up with that must have thought they were being clever. Carl had also set up a couple of different-colored background screens and had taken some photos of Spector for a New York driver’s license and a passport. He had taken off as soon as the work was done, but had come back a couple of days later with the driver’s license and some instructions about the upcoming job Spector was supposed to do. As always, someone was in need of getting dead.', '“May I help you, sir?” The teller’s tone was friendly in a tired, rote kind of way.', '“I need to open an account.” He handed over his fake driver’s license and a creased envelope heavy with bills.', '“I’m sure we can help you with that.”', 'Spector looked the teller over while she was walking him through the paperwork. She was youngish, but clearly old enough to have been around the block a few times. Her eyes were bright and intelligent; she was too smart for her job and there was no way she’d last.', 'He stopped at the Strand on his way back to the apartment and found his way to the travel section. Spector had never really imagined himself leaving the NYC area, but it was an interesting notion. Why couldn’t he travel some, see the world? He picked out some dog-eared travel guides for Australia, England, a few other European countries, and Tahiti. He tried to imagine anyone needing to be killed in Tahiti and couldn’t, so he put that travel guide back on the shelf. Spector headed to the counter to check out.', 'Later, on the sofa at his apartment, he paged slowly through the guides while emptying a pint of bourbon. There really was a great big world out there, and if it took a few random bodies to see it that was a price he was willing to pay.', '\\xa0', 'Spector’s mark, a Mr. DiCiccio, was a Gambione lieutenant. Back on Wild Card Day, Spector had had a run-in with some Gambiones, and he didn’t much care for them. His target was in a high-rise apartment, holed up with several other people. Mostly bodyguards, from the info he had. They sent one guy out every day or so to buy groceries. He always wore the same dark blue suit. Spector’s associates had made an identical garment for him to wear, which would make getting inside easier. Working with an organization of professionals had its upside. He stalked the man from the grocery store and caught up with him outside the high-rise.', '“Down the alley, friend.” Spector put a gun in the man’s back, although he had no intention of using it. Guns left evidence; his power didn’t.', '“You’re making a mistake, mister.” The man walked with a grudging slowness into the mouth of the alley. “A big mistake.”', '“That’s my lookout, paisan.” Spector herded him behind a pile of garbage twenty yards in. “Set the bags down, put your hands up, and turn around.”', 'The man did as he was told, then looked Spector directly in the eye and said, “Whatever you’ve got in mind, you’re a dead man, you know.”', 'He flooded the gangster’s mind with the memory of his death, pushing it in so fast the man’s body hit the ground before his face had the chance to register pain, surprise, or anything else. “Yep. Been that way for a while, tough guy.”', 'Spector picked up the two sacks of groceries and moved to the building entrance. He entered the code he’d been given and elbowed his way inside. There were fresh fruits and vegetables in one of the sacks. For a moment, he remembered being a kid at the supermarket. It was just a corner grocery, but it had seemed so big to his young eyes. He pushed the memory away. It was time to focus. There was a room of people several stories up where he was headed now. Those eyes were the last thing they’d ever see. Tough break for them, maybe. He imagined what it was like in Paris about right now.', 'The elevator was slow and creaky and his arms were getting tired by the time the doors opened. He moved quickly down the hallway and pressed the doorbell on room 817. Spector held the groceries up higher and turned away from the door so they couldn’t see much of his face.', '“Come in, Antonio.” The voice belonged to an older woman. She turned her back to him and headed into the kitchen. “Just put the groceries on the counter. We’ll eat in an hour or so if you’ll all just leave me alone.”', 'Spector deposited the bags on the Formica countertop and padded into the living area, where there was a TV playing a basketball game. There were two men on the couch, one old and heavy, the other young and heavier. The older man was watching TV and turned, expecting to see Antonio.', '“What the . . .” he managed to say before Spector put him down.', 'The young man peered up from behind a magazine. His reflexes were fast and he almost made it to his gun before Spector locked eyes. Almost. Spector smiled in a thin, crooked way. This was going better than he could have hoped. The fact that they’d been on a couch meant no sound of bodies hitting the floor to warn anyone else. He would prefer not to kill the old woman, although he’d do it in an instant if he had to. One thing he couldn’t do was leave a witness. The way he offed his victims didn’t create any actual leads for the cops to use against him, but a witness could be trouble.', 'He glanced over at a mostly empty bookshelf on the far side of the room. A porcelain clock noisily ticked away the seconds. His target was almost certainly in the bedroom beyond, and had no idea how few seconds he had left to breathe.', 'Spector advanced to the doorway of the bedroom and stuck his head inside. An old man in silk pajamas sat propped up on the bed. He turned to the doorway.', '“Antonio?”', 'Spector tried to lock eyes, but for some reason it wasn’t working. He felt fear; his power was the only thing he could count on. The old man put on his glasses and craned his head forward. Spector connected immediately. The old man’s final breath took a long time to leave his body, a leisurely rattling cough.', 'The bathroom door opened. A wiry man with graying hair stared momentarily at the bed, then went for his gun. He got the weapon out fast and fired the first shot without looking. The bullet missed Spector and thudded into the wall behind him, spraying bits of Sheetrock. The man squeezed off another round before Spector was able to catch his eye. Then it was over.', '“Fuck,” Spector muttered. Now he’d have to kill the old lady in the kitchen. Her bad luck, but there was nothing he could do about it now. He walked quickly back into the living room and was almost to the kitchen when she shouted something in Italian.', 'For an instant he saw her. She was holding something and her arms moved, then it hit him. Water, scalding hot. He screamed and clutched his face. As much as he hated his death pain, he was used to it after all this time. This was worse for being so unexpected. She’d nailed him right in his eyes and he couldn’t see anything. He reflexively kicked out his right leg and caught nothing but air, setting himself off-balance. She grabbed him under his armpits and pushed him backward. He heard glass break, and then there was nothing under his feet. In spite of the pain, Spector knew he was falling. If he landed on his head from eight stories up, that was it. He twisted his body, trying to get his legs underneath him.', 'Spector felt a blow to his midsection and all the air went out of his lungs.', '“Just in time. Good thing I was climbing up the building or we’d both be out of luck.” The voice was strange, not quite human.', 'He didn’t spend much time trying to figure out why he wasn’t a smashed heap on the pavement. In addition to everything else, one of Spector’s left ribs was broken.', '“Get me out of here,” he said through his blistering lips.', '“I can take you back where you came from.” The voice definitely wasn’t human, probably a joker.', '“Someone just tried to kill me up there. Get me someplace safe. I’ll pay.”', '“You’re already paying, or I wouldn’t be here.”', 'Spector couldn’t tell how long it took for his rescuer to get him where he was going. His face was a mass of scalded nerve endings. The important thing was that he’d survived. He’d heal up soon enough. In the meantime he’d just have to endure. That was his life in a nutshell, getting from moment to moment and day to day. He could do that.', 'He heard a door open and the whatever-it-was set him down on a couch. Spector felt a broken spring underneath his ribs and rolled over on his other side. The radio was on, playing the Byrds’ “Turn! Turn! Turn!” His eyes were still a mess. He couldn’t see squat out of them. “Do you have any liquor?”', '“Sure.”', 'He heard some rummaging around and felt a bottle pressed into his right palm. Spector unscrewed the cap and pressed the rim to his lips, taking as many quick swallows as he could manage. It was vodka, not bourbon, but he didn’t care. Enough of it would do the job.', '“You need anything else? I’ve got places to be. Busy, busy, busy.” The voice wasn’t just inhuman, it was quick and staccato, like the words were racing to get out of its mouth.', '“I’ll survive.” If Spector had a motto, that was it.', '“Later.”', 'Spector heard a door close and continued knocking back enough vodka to take the edge off the pain. He’d been badly burned once before and had figured out that dead skin can’t heal, it just sits there. He’d had to peel it off to jump-start the regeneration process.', 'There were bits of pasta stuck to his face. Pulling them free was uncomfortable, but not excruciating. Then he put his hands to his eyelids. They were rippled, bloated, and stuck to his eyeballs. “Fuck me,” he said, draining as much of the bottle as he could. Spector pulled off his coat and put it over his head. That, at least, would cut down on the light. He worked a fingernail into the corner of one of his eyelids and began pulling it away from his eye. At first it came off in little bits, then the entire piece of ruined flesh peeled away. He screamed and forced the bottle back between his lips. It was empty by the time he finished the job.', '\\xa0', 'Spector staggered through the doorway of his joker-rescuer’s hideout and made it about ten feet before vomiting the first time. There were still some dead patches of skin on his face he’d have to pick away, but his eyelids were working again and that was what mattered most. He threw up twice more before making it to the corner. The cold wind drained the warmth from his body, adding to his misery level. Spector took note of where he was; it might be useful in the future, having a place he could duck into if the heat was on. Of course that was contingent on how hospitable the joker was at that point.', 'He managed to flag down a cab and huddled silently in the back for the entire trip to his apartment. The cabbie wasn’t talkative or annoying, so Spector not only let him live, he gave the man a healthy tip.', 'The springs on his beat-up sofa groaned as he flopped down onto it. He looked around his living room and realized that he finally had enough money to make some improvements. The place was a wreck, much like its occupant, and it would be hard to know where to even start. Spector closed his eyes; he’d think about it later. Right now sleep was the first order of business, and for once he didn’t expect any trouble drifting off.', '\\xa0', 'The door buzzer went off three times, spaced at intervals of several seconds. The signal meant Carl, the kid he wasn’t supposed to kill, was downstairs. Spector hobbled to the door, glancing at the kitchen clock; he’d been out for four hours.', '“Damn,” he muttered to himself, then opened the door after hearing footsteps up the stairs.', 'Carl poked his head in tentatively, not bothering with mirrorshades this time, and tried to smile. “May I come in, sir?”', '“You woke me up.”', 'Carl’s face lost a shade of color. “I’m very sorry. I won’t take more than a moment of your time.” He handed Spector an envelope. “There’s a check inside for the agreed amount payable to you from one of our holding companies.”', 'Spector took the envelope and opened it. He pulled out the check to make sure it was payment in full. It was. “Are you afraid of me, Carl?”', 'Carl paused for a moment. Spector could feel the kid’s mind searching for the answer least likely to get him killed.', '“Tell your boss I almost got killed again. My enthusiasm for this partnership is waning. Now get the fuck out of here.”', 'Carl hit the doorway like a thoroughbred racehorse.', '\\xa0', 'Spector didn’t know what he was doing, or why he was doing it. He’d gone to the bank to deposit the check, but instead he’d taken half out in cash. He planned on giving it to the joker who’d helped him out. He wasn’t the kind of person who was big on gratitude, but maybe that was because nobody ever did anything for him. People did shitty things to him pretty regularly. Not that they got a chance to do much else after that. Nobody actually helped him out, though. He’d felt strange, having some kind of obligation to another person, even if it was accidental. He didn’t much like the feeling and was happy to buy his way out of it.', 'He was wearing his bird mask when he knocked on the door to the joker’s place. If there was no answer that was fine, he’d have tried to do something and that was good enough. “Anybody home?”', '“Just a minute, minute, minute.”', 'The joker opened the door; Spector saw his rescuer for the first time. It was big, half again the size of a normal person, and its skin was dark and moist. The face was a cross between a human and a newt, with slitted yellow eyes. Its arms and legs were long and muscular, with knobby tips at the end of the fingers.', '“You got my pizza?” it asked, then looked with disappointment at his empty hands. “Who are you?”', '“It’s me, from yesterday. You saved my life when I fell out of the building.”', 'The joker blinked its eyes rapidly, then cocked its head. “Oh right. The paper said you were dead, Mr. DiCiccio, so I was confused. I hadn’t made clear how big I am, so I was going to do my bodyguarding from outside the building.” He stared off into space for a moment. “Kind of muddled right now anyway.”', 'The dime dropped for Spector. DiCiccio, his mark, must have gotten word there was a contract on him. So he hired Mr. Big-and-Ugly, who showed up just in time to save Spector’s hash. What fucking luck. Spector would have felt warm and fuzzy if he were able to. “Yeah, I’m supposed to be dead, safer that way. That’s why I’m wearing the mask. Can I come in?”', '“Sure, sure.”', 'He was uncomfortable and wanted to get this over with as quickly as possible. Didn’t want to know the joker’s name or anything else about him. He fished in his pocket for a wad of hundreds. “What you did yesterday was kind of above the call, so I figured a bonus was in order.” He peeled off several bills and placed them in the palm of the joker’s hand. Spector didn’t really want to know his benefactor’s name, on the remote chance he had to kill him at some point.', '“Hey, great. Much appreciated.” The joker tucked the money into the pocket of a coat hanging on a rack in the corner. “After I have some pizza we should go out for a few drinks.”', '“That’s okay, thanks.”', '“No, no, no, really. It’ll be fun. I don’t have anything on for tonight. I know a place where you can wear your mask, no problem. They serve drinks with straws if you want. I’ve seen people do it plenty of times.” The words streamed out of its mouth like a sibilant auctioneer.', 'Spector sighed and pressed his thin lips together. He could always use a drink or three. “What the hell,” he said. The pizza came soon enough, and Spector waited, fighting off second thoughts, as the joker quickly consumed a sizable portion before wiping his face with a napkin and both went outside.', '“I can’t exactly use a car, and people on the subway just freak out, so climb aboard,” the joker said, pointing to his neck and shoulders.', 'Spector clambered up the joker’s broad back. The skin was actually pleasant to the touch, soft and not slimy. He’d expected it to feel weird. He grabbed its shoulders on either side of the neck. “Ready whenever you are.”', 'The joker took off with a jolt. His bounding stride took Spector awhile to adjust to, but soon he was bobbing his body up and down in sync with his amphibian carrier. Spector had never done any horseback riding, so he didn’t have anything else to compare it to, but imagined it to be similar. He felt strange, though, and couldn’t place the sensation. Then he realized he was having fun. It had been a long time since he’d felt this good without killing someone. He might even be smiling. More likely it was just the icy December night numbing his lips under his mask.', 'The blocks sped by as they moved deeper into Jokertown. His ride was nimble, but didn’t put too much effort into avoiding obstacles. Trash cans were trodden or kicked and left emptied of their contents. He’d even jumped on an old ’68 Dodge Dart and crushed the hood.', 'They were halfway down a particularly narrow alley when a police growler stopped in front of them and flipped on its rotating red-and-blues. Spector was surprised for an instant. Normally cops from the Jokertown Precinct didn’t make waves. ', 'A moment later the joker was effortlessly scaling the wall. Spector hung on for dear life until they reached the top and sped away over the tops of the buildings.', '“Don’t like cops?” he asked.', '“They can be a pain slow us down who needs that?” The words butted together like cars on a gridlocked freeway.', 'After Mr. Newt’s wild ride finally came to an end, Spector smelled Chinese food. “Are we eating?” he asked.', 'The joker shook his head as Spector dismounted. “Need a drink. Squisher’s.” He headed down the stairs, opened the door, and squeezed himself through the doorway.', 'Spector guessed pizza was off the agenda, at least for now. Spector had heard about Squisher’s Basement, but had never been particularly interested in going there. Still, he walked down the stairs, making sure his mask was securely on his face. Being recognized as a non-joker would probably lead to trouble.', 'The interior of Squisher’s smelled like week-old fish sticks soaked in urine, but the atmosphere was still homey in a battered kind of way. Behind the bar was a massive fish tank inhabited by a manatee/octopus joker. Squisher himself, no doubt. The place was decently crowded, a few jokers at the bar and a couple opposite each other in a booth. There was a crowded table where a group of albino-looking jokers crowded around another joker with a giant head. Looking closer, he saw their faces were smeared with greasepaint. The pasty-faced bunch was uniformly muscular and dressed in similar clothing; a gang, maybe.', 'Spector hated gangs. On first glance he thought they were octuplets, but on looking a bit closer he saw that they weren’t actually identical, just similar.', '“We should get one of the big-boy booths in the back,” said Spector’s amphibian companion.', 'The big-boy booths were clearly for jokers in the extra-large range. Spector stood over six feet, but had to hoist himself up onto the bench seat. His legs swung like a kid’s beneath him. The joker eased in comfortably opposite him.', '“A pitcher of beer and a shot of whiskey,” he said. “My friend will have . . .” He turned to Spector.', '“A double shot of bourbon, with a straw. And keep it coming.”', 'The waitperson was a short joker with multiple arms and a semitransparent, ghostlike appearance. It placed the drinks down in a practiced manner. Spector handed it a twenty. The joker nodded and bobbled away.', 'Spector slid the straw through the mouth-hole of his mask and took a long, satisfying draw of bourbon. It wasn’t Jack Black, but it would get the job done.', '“So, what do you do for fun down here?”', 'The joker shrugged. “Same as anyplace else, just a little dirtier here. And cheaper,” he said, raising his glass.', '“I’ll drink to that.” Spector clinked his shot glass against the joker’s beer mug and took another swallow.', 'Spector’s friend pulled out an amber bottle and poured a half-dozen pills into his oversized palm. He then downed them with a massive gulp of beer.', '“What exactly are those for?”', '“Energy, plus keeps the sandman away.”', ' Spector thought. “Do you know where I could get something for pain? Still pretty beat up and I can’t go to the doctor. Someone might spot me.”', 'The joker cocked his head and belched. “No, just these. I did know somebody who had pain pills: who that was can’t remember.”', 'Spector sighed and took another slug of bourbon. If he could find a pain-med supplier it would make his life easier. Hell, he’d even let them live if they weren’t too much of an asshole. Drug dealers usually were, though.', '“Let me know if it comes back to you.”', 'An eyeball floated past Spector’s left shoulder and pivoted so that the business end was facing him. He wondered if he could kill the orb’s owner. Probably.', 'Newt-man snatched the eyeball out of the air, tossed it into his mostly full beer glass, and gave the glass a shake.', 'There was a scream from table with the gang and several members stood angrily, each assuming a fighting posture.', 'Spector’s friend fished the eyeball out of his beer and blew the foam off it, then let it go. The eye floated quickly back toward the joker with the massive head. Each of the muscle-punks was standing and pointing in a way that might be threatening to the average Joe.', '“Keep your eyes to yourself, Sue,” he said matter-of-factly.', 'Squisher poked his head out of the top of his tank with what Spector figured was a really unhappy look on his manatee-like face.', '“Hey, how about those Knicks?” Spector said, turning his back to the oversized aquatic joker. A stream of water caught him in the back of the head.', '“Let’s get out of here.” Newt-thing pushed himself up from the table and finished his mug of beer in a couple of swallows.', 'Spector followed him outside, turning up his collar to the biting cold.\\xa0\\xa0 “So, who is this Sue?”', '“Sue Maroo. Joker with lots of detachable eyes. She snoops for certain parties, yes parties. Other things, too. Nasty things. Her boys help her. Mostly rejects from other gangs. Little shits. Sue and I have had a couple of run-ins. She wound up with the short end of the stick. Yes, yes.” He blinked his eyes rapidly. “Hey, speaking of the Knicks, I’ve got some tickets to tomorrow night’s game with the Celtics.” He inserted a pair of knobby fingers into a pouch on his waist and produced a ticket. “You should come. We’ll have a great time.”', 'Spector took the ticket out of what might have been politeness. The joker’s enthusiasm was a tough headwind to buck. “The Celts are great again this year.”', '“Yeah, but the Knicks have Patrick Ewing.”', 'Spector shrugged. “I’ll think about it.”', '“Sure. We still need to eat, right. Let’s get a pizza.”', 'His companion was crazed as far as Spector was concerned, but he was still hungry. “Why the hell not.”', '\\xa0', 'The movie wasn’t what he’d hoped it would be. One of the art-house theaters was showing ', ' and Spector had figured watching it might be a good way to put himself in an international state of mind. It wasn’t working. Gene Kelly could sing and dance. Hell, seemed like everyone could sing and dance. Nothing was real, though. It was set in Paris, but it was pure Hollywood.', 'Spector fished the few remaining bits out of his popcorn and chewed them silently, then left his seat and walked across the sticky floor to the exit.', 'Outside, the frigid wind whipped his clothes and chilled his exposed skin. At least the sun was out for now. Spector looked around slowly. New York felt the way a big city should: cold, filthy, oppressive, and uncaring.', 'He had plenty of cash, so Spector flagged a cab for a ride back to his apartment. The cabbie didn’t have anything to say, which was good because Spector was in the mood to kill someone and he didn’t feel like grabbing another ride just to get home.', 'Spector had the cab drop him a block away from his apartment. He was feeling uneasy and didn’t know why, so he let his paranoia get the better of him. He spotted a black Olds parked outside his apartment building, engine running. As he walked by he saw a young woman in the back seat looking at a notepad. Probably a grad student from NYU or Columbia doing her thesis on how the other half lives. He moved carefully up the stairs, which were coated in half ice, half slush, and entered the building with a backward glance at the car. The young girl was watching him, but looked away when he returned her gaze.', 'His apartment was cold, so he turned up the heat and poured a tumbler with a few inches of Jack Black. A couple of swallows helped warm and numb him. He dropped himself onto the couch and turned on the TV. He didn’t bother to change the channel from the soap opera that was playing.', 'Someone rapped on his door.', 'Spector hauled himself up off the couch and cracked the door open. It looked like the woman from the car, but he wasn’t sure. She had shoulder-length brown hair, thick-lensed glasses, and more attitude than a person her age was entitled to.', '“Who are you?”', '“I’m Ms. Davis. I’m Carl’s replacement. He’s afraid of you. For the record, I know who you are and I’m not afraid of you.” She lifted her chin and narrowed her eyes.', 'Spector shook his head. “Then you’re too stupid to be a lawyer. Or much of anything else, Miss Davis.”', '“Ms.”', 'He partly wanted to punch her and partly wanted to kill her. Spector didn’t want a corpse in his apartment, though. And he didn’t much like killing women. Not that women didn’t deserve it just as much as men, but tombstoning one made him think of his time with the Astronomer. Those were bad times he wanted to put in the rearview mirror.', '“We have a very lucrative opportunity for you. The benefits would include not only cash reimbursement, but also many of the items I understand have been previously discussed with you.” She looked directly into his eyes. “Are you interested?”', '“Depends,” Spector replied, moving over to the table to pick up his bottle of Jack Black. He took a swallow. This kid was trying too hard. People with too much to prove were almost always more trouble than they were worth.', '“All the information you need is in this folder.” She presented it to Spector, who ignored it. “The subject is a high-priority item as he’s an ace. Just freelance, but we want to remove any enhanced individuals from the opposition side of the board. He may already be working for them.”', 'Spector snarled at her, “Fuck no. No aces.” He pushed her toward the door and opened it, then shoved her hard through the doorway. “Aces can get me killed.”', '“I hope you’ll reconsider. His name is Cro—” Spector slammed the door shut before she could finish another syllable. They didn’t care if he got killed again. What the hell did he need financial experts for anyway?', 'He refilled his tumbler with bourbon. Maybe he’d go to the Knicks game and take his mind off things for a while.', '\\xa0', 'The crowd outside the Garden was cold and surly, holidays be damned. Spector didn’t like crowds. If a situation got out of hand it was hard to decide who to kill first. Plus, he just didn’t like people much. Inside the arena smelled of dirty slush, and, once the people removed their coats, the dank sweat of partisan hatred peculiar to sports fans. The talk from the people around Spector wasn’t optimistic. The hated Celtics were the best team in the Eastern Division, with a frontline of Bird, McHale, and Parrish. Plus Ainge and D.J. at the guards. The Knicks had Pat Ewing, who was great but still somewhat new to the league. The Knicks had other good players, but it was still likely to be a slaughter. Spector had never been a big Knicks fan. He’d seen Dr. J play for the Nets back in the old ABA. The ABA was long gone, and Julius had decided to hang it up at the end of last season.', 'Spector got in line for something to drink. Beer didn’t do much for him, but he had some Jack Black to sweeten it up once he took his seat.', 'He spiked his beer with bourbon and finished it before warmups were done. There was no way a giant crazed joker was going to make it into the Garden, so he’d have room to spread out if he wanted.', 'A young, bearded guy with thick glasses was sitting a few seats down. His orange and blue cap marked him as part of the home crowd, and he chanted, “Let’s go Knicks! Let’s go Knicks! Let’s go Knicks!” for upward of a solid minute. Spector was getting irritated—not homicidal irritated but please-shut-the-fuck-up irritated. The Knicks fan finally quit yelling.', 'He was comfortably numb by the time tip-off arrived. The crowd noise, which had been little more than a buzz, grew to a roar as the game got underway.', 'On their first possession the Celtics worked the ball around until it wound up in Bird’s hands in the left corner. He lowered his shoulder into the defender to make space and shot. The ball swished through the net to a groan from the hometown fans.', 'The rest of the first quarter saw the lead change hands several times. Neither team led by more than five points, but the Celts were up three at the end of the first twelve minutes.', 'Spector heard a commotion from the upper deck. There were a few screams mingled in with the general hubbub. He craned his neck to see what was going on. A large, dark form clambered over the upper deck railing and jumped, landing with a massive thud in the aisle between his section and the adjacent one.', 'It was the joker, of course. Spector had really thought there was no way for him to get inside, but he’d underestimated the creature’s determination.', 'Newt-thing had purchased three seats and Spector was in the center one, which was clearly a mistake.', '“Mind moving over, buddy buddy,” he said, gesturing with his oversized hands.', '“Not at all,” Spector replied, “just keeping it warm for you.” He took the next seat over.', 'The joker gingerly tore the armrest from between his two seats and dropped it on the floor. He leaned over. “Would you mind buying us a couple of beers, and maybe some pizza? If I try to move, people will make trouble.”', '“It’s on me, big guy,” Spector said. He figured this situation was going to be trouble no matter what. Being in the concourses right now was probably his best play.', 'The line at the concessions wasn’t bad. Spector had a pizza and a couple of beers in less than five minutes. He hadn’t heard any crowd noises that were out of the ordinary. Nothing that resembled the death screams of people being torn to pieces by a giant newt.', 'As he headed back down his aisle, Spector spotted a couple of security guys talking to each other, but they didn’t look like they were inclined to do anything. Yet.', 'Spector made it back to their seats and realized there was no way he was getting by the joker. He handed him the beers and said, “I’ll get by behind and come over.”', '“Okay. Pizza, goooood. So hungry.”', 'As he was sliding by two men to reach a place where he could step over a vacant seat, one of them said, “You know, your friend is making it really hard to see the game.”', '“Feel free to tell him about it,” Spector replied, dropping into his seat. He didn’t give them another thought. The joker daintily handed him a beer between a massive thumb and first finger.', 'The Celtics started to pull away in the second quarter, mostly by feeding the ball to McHale and Parrish down low. At one point Ewing sent a Parrish shot into the second row. That drew a thunderous cheer from the Knicks fans. Spector chugged his beer.', '“Might want to take it easy with that.” The joker pointed to Spector’s cup. “I put a little pick-me-up in there. Great for staying alert.”', 'Spector felt a tingle under his tongue. “Speed?”', 'The joker nodded. “Helps keep me awake. I’m going to crash before too much longer if I don’t keep a bunch in my system.”', 'Spector stared into the cup. What remained of the foam was dissipating into small clumps of bubbles. He’d never taken speed before. His whole deal was deadening his senses, not pushing them to the max. He felt the pain surging inside him. It hurt more than usual, but felt different. Normally the sensation of sharing his death was like pushing goo into another person’s mind. Now he felt like lightning in a bottle. The sensation of power almost made up for additional pain.', '“You can’t stay here, big guy.” Spector looked over and saw a couple of security personnel talking to his newt companion.', 'The joker let out a rumbling laugh. “Feel free to drag me out if you can. It’s not even halftime yet and I’m here to see the game.”', 'The uniformed men looked at each other, hopelessness and anger on their faces.', '“We’ll help you get this ugly fuck out of here.” One of the men sitting behind big newt stood and thumped his sizable chest. The man next to him got up, too. “We haven’t been able to see shit since he sat down.”', 'The joker stood quickly, a slice of pizza disappearing into his mouth. “You just need a different seat, friend.” He took the man under the armpits with his blotched hands and tossed him screaming into the upper deck of the Garden. He grabbed the man’s buddy by his jacket. “What about you?”', '“Don’t throw me up there!”', 'Newt-man looked around several times, then smiled. “Fair enough.” He turned and launched the man into the Celtics bench, knocking players and staff onto the court like bowling pins.', 'Spector laughed out loud. This was better than any game. The entire Celtics bench charged the stands. The Celts on the floor looked at each other for a second then followed their teammates in the melee. Danny Ainge was screaming.', 'Spector felt something wet and cold hit the back of his head. Beer. He turned and saw a man pointing at him and smiling.', '“Fuck you, buddy.” He killed the asshole in an instant. It felt good. The dead man dropped onto the seat in front of him like a sack of potatoes.', 'People in the stands around Spector were going apeshit. A knot of Celtics fans had poured down the aisle and were whaling away on the joker, but it wasn’t going well for them. The joker picked up one man in each oversized mitt and smacked them together, then head-butted another. Uniformed security officers were trying to intervene at courtside, but several of the Celtics players were fighting their way up the aisle. Danny Ainge’s green uniform was spattered in blood. It looked very festive. Spector was thinking it might be a good time to kill his way out of this mess when he caught a sucker punch to the right side of his head and a couple more to his ribs. He fell breathless to the concrete and looked for his assailant.', 'An instant later a middle-aged man with a beer gut and a Celtics shirt bounded gracelessly down from the row behind Spector and glared down at him.', 'Spector blew the life out of him and put a leg up, making sure the man didn’t fall onto him, then pushed his body over backward. The corpse made a heavy noise as it hit, punctuated by a nasty thwack when his skull impacted the concrete.', 'In addition to the security forces near the floor, a large group of uniformed men were shoulder-cutting down the aisle toward the brawl in the stands. They were making headway at a slow but steady pace. Before long they’d be in Spector and his friend’s lap. ', 'Spector turned back toward the court to see if that was a reasonable way of retreat. Nope. The angry Celtic contingent was smashing through the Knick partisans, fists flailing. Spector saw Larry Bird; if only the Celtic star would look his way, he could deal the Boston Greenies a fatal blow. Bird looked his way, just for an instant. Spector locked in and pushed, but lost contact as he was gathered up by a massive newt hand.', '“Time to go, go, go. Yes indeed.”', 'The joker leaped to the upper deck. Spector hadn’t really seen the extent of his jumping power. It was impressive, and almost made him heave the contents of his stomach onto the fans underneath them. The joker vaulted upward again into the girders and catwalks that formed the upper skeleton of the Garden. Spector eyed a large hole in the roof, figuring that was where the joker had made a forced entrance. It was now their way out from the melee far below. Spector hissed as they exited the building into the biting Manhattan air. It was quite a view.', '\\xa0', 'The sound of sirens had receded into the distance behind them. The joker carried Spector like before as they sped across the rooftops and across walls.', 'Spector’s massive companion was beginning to move in stops and starts. The speed must be wearing off. Not the case for Spector, who was brimming with pain and sharp as a tack. It was beyond uncomfortable, but in a powerful way. Not something he’d want to do again, most likely.', 'He wasn’t familiar with the rooftop views, but Spector could tell they’d been in Jokertown for a while by the smell.', '“Almost there,” the joker said, shaking his head. “Time to head to the, uh, street. Don’t want to fall.”', '“Good idea,” Spector said. It would be ironic if the joker saved him from a bone-shattering fall a couple of days ago only to drop him several stories now. Spector wasn’t into irony, unless there was a nice payday attached. He dropped off the joker’s back when they hit street level. His arms and shoulders were sore and aching from hanging on much of the way.', '“Gotta get home,” the joker said.', 'Spector looked around. Jokertown in the dark wasn’t easy for him to navigate, but he had a fair sense of where he was. “I think it’s a few blocks that way, then hook a left and you’re there.”', '“Right,” the joker said slowly. He turned and started walking down the cracked, litter-strewn sidewalk.', 'Spector shrugged. He figured the joker would make it back one way or another. For now, he was cold and hungry and needed a few more shots of liquor. Not much chance of catching a cab here, so he turned in the direction of the nearest subway stop. He hadn’t gone more than fifty feet when a van screamed out of a nearby alley. Before he could jump out of the way, Spector felt the side of the vehicle slam into him. The impact knocked him several yards back into the wall of a nearby tenement. He howled, all too familiar with how broken bones felt. This was just a couple of ribs, and they’d mend in a hurry, but he was going to make these fuckers pay if he could catch them.', 'He got up and staggered after the van. His hip hurt, too. Spector had all the pain in the world to share with the asshole driver. When it came to killing people, joker or nat, it didn’t make any difference to him. The van came to an abrupt halt, tires squealing. The doors slammed open and several people piled out. Spector’s suspicion that they were armed was confirmed seconds later when he heard rounds popping off. A bullet to his head could. . . well, he wasn’t sure exactly what it could do, but he didn’t want to find out.', 'He heard a scream and a body flew over his head and bounced hard off the sidewalk. Spector moved toward the person to get a closer look. A young man got shakily to his feet and pointed a gun in Spector’s direction. The man holding it was one of the pasty boys from Squisher’s. Nearby Spector saw broken glass and smoking cement.', 'Spector grabbed the man’s gun arm and pointed it away from him, then pulled him close. There was just enough illumination from a dirty streetlight for Spector to see his face clearly. He locked eyes and killed him in an instant. When the man’s head hit the sidewalk something popped off. Spector picked it up—headphones connected to a battery pack in the dead guy’s pocket. He put one headphone to his ear, letting the battery dangle. He heard a woman speaking.', '“Get his eyes. Who had the acid? Get it in his eyes.”', '“I think it was Jesse. He’s gone,” a voice replied.', 'Spector dropped the headphones. He’d heard enough. These bozos and Sue Maroo were looking for payback. He limped forward as fast as he could, gritting his teeth. They hadn’t counted on him when they decided to kill his joker friend, or whatever he was. That was their mistake.', 'There was no one behind the wheel of the van, so Spector walked around front. The punks must have run out of ammo, as they were attacking the joker with knives and clubs. Newt-joker was holding his own for the moment, but the numbers were against him. The massive joker staggered into a badly lit area. Spector shook his head. It would be nearly impossible to lock eyes unless the battle moved back into the light.', 'Something small glided noiselessly by his shoulder. One of the joker’s attackers wheeled and charged Spector, knife in hand. Spector dodged, but the knife caught him on the elbow. More pain. He was about to give it back in spades. He caught the punk’s eyes and put him down in a heap.', 'Another eye floated by, just out of his reach. Sue was pretty smart. Spector jumped as high as his meth-pumped body would go, extending his arms. His fingers closed on empty air a few inches short of the orb. It was like the damned thing was taunting him. More likely it was keeping him busy so the other creeps could take down the joker, who was now down on one knee.', 'Spector dodged around the back of the van, scrambled up on top of it, spotted the eye, and pushed off as hard as he could in its direction.', 'He felt something soft struggling in his palm as he hit the pavement. Spector opened his fingers up a bit, and was surprised and annoyed at what he found. The eye had a lid, and it was closed tightly. He stuck a dirty thumbnail under the lid and slid it upward, prying it slowly open.', 'Another one of the thugs turned from the joker and headed his way. The eye was fully open and Spector gazed into it, hoping this would work. He forced his death into the eye and it went still in his hand. There was a soft wheeze from somewhere nearby. The punk who’d been headed his way paused and turned his head with uncertainty. He tapped his ear.', '“You are so fucked, buddy,” Spector said, catching the man’s eye. A moment later, one more corpse was now getting cold in the winter air. The other punks scattered.', 'The joker got back to his feet. His wounds looked superficial from what Spector could tell. “Saw what you did. Thanks.”', '“The Knicks didn’t win tonight, but we did.” Spector motioned to the open van. “Climb in. I’ll drive you home.”', 'Unfortunately, his giant newt body didn’t fit inside, so the joker climbed on top, crumpling the roof over the back part of the van.', 'Spector jumped in behind the wheel and started the engine. The trip was only a few blocks, he’d been right about that, but the van groaned under the weight of the joker every foot of the way. One of the rear tires blew out and they had to make the final hundred yards riding the rim.', '“Home again, home again,” Spector said, as the joker tumbled from the top of the damaged van.', '“Get me inside.”', 'Spector guided and talked the joker into his place. Big Newt collapsed heavily on the floor, his eyes already closed.', '“Turn on the radio.”', 'Spector located the radio and flipped it on. A light behind the dial flickered to life. The music wasn’t anything Spector recognized. He set the door lock and headed out into the freezing New York night.', '\\xa0', 'Spector was sitting in a booth at the Crystal Palace with a cup of coffee and a bottle of whiskey. The light from outside was soft. It was early still. The meth had kept him up all night. He had hoofed it to the nearest subway stop, making it there without further incident. Later, he’d picked up a large pepperoni pizza. That and half a bottle of Jack Black had gotten him through the night. When he left his place to come to the Crystal Palace Spector had had a good reason for doing it. Now he couldn’t remember what that was. He had the sports section of the ', ' open in front of him.', '“Bird Considers Retirement After Near-Death Experience,” the headline read in bold type. Too bad he hadn’t killed the fucker, but at least Bird would think long and hard before putting on Celtic Green again.', 'Elmo, wearing mirrorshades again, walked up to his booth and coughed. “She wants to see you again.”', 'Spector couldn’t imagine why. He didn’t think he knew anything that Chrysalis didn’t. Still, the last time he visited with her he’d gotten some free whiskey, so why the hell not?', 'Chrysalis was seated in her chair when Spector entered her private room. As expected, she also wore mirrored glasses.\\xa0 “Mr. Spector,” she said, “how decent of you to join me.”', '“Sure.”', '“Quite a lot of excitement last night.” The muscles in her chest moved slightly as she took a deep breath.', 'Spector held up his sports section. “Yeah, I was just reading about it.”', '“I wasn’t referring to the incident at the sports arena, Mr. Spector.\\xa0 Have you ever heard of Sue Maroo?”', 'He decided to play dumb. “Nope.”', '“I see.”', 'Chrysalis was impossible to read. Spector had denied being involved and he was going to stick with that. “You mind if I get back to my newspaper and pick-me-up?”', 'She gestured toward the door with a bony finger.', '“One thing,” Spector said, turning back. “My gut feeling is there’s a war coming. A big one. Blood in the streets kind of a deal. You might keep an ear to the ground.”', 'Chrysalis cocked her head slightly. “My ear is always to the ground, and a war sounds like a situation you might be able to—exploit.”', '“A man’s gotta eat,” he said, heading back to his booth. “Happy Holidays,” he added in parting.', '“Enjoy the Yuletide, Mr. Spector.”', 'Spector lingered in the Crystal Palace for an hour or so, nursing his coffee and drink, mulling over his brief adventure. He’d had fun, and it wasn’t just killing fun.', 'His mind drifted to wondering what it would have been like to be an international assassin. Probably a pain, having to learn languages and deal with customs. Jet lag, too. He was better off right here. There were millions of people in New York City, and plenty of them needed killing.', 'He got up from his booth and left the Crystal Palace. The bitter New York cold embraced him like a long-lost child who’d finally found his way home.', '\\xa0', '“The City That Never Sleeps” copyright © 2019 by Walton Simons.', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by John Picacio.']}\n"

How much time do we have left, and do we even understand what timescale to use? As a slow apocalypse blooms across the Earth, planets and plants, animals and microbes, all live and die and evolve at different scales. Is one human life long enough to unravel the mystery?', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'On the first night of the meteor storm, his mother came to wake him up, but LT was only pretending to sleep. He’d been lying in the dark waiting for the end of the world.', ' she said. He didn’t want to leave the bed but she was an intense woman who could beam energy into him with a look. She took his hand and led him between the stacks of moving boxes, then across the backyard and through the cattle gate to the field, where the view was unimpeded by trees. Meteors, dozens of meteors, scored the sky. She spread a blanket across the tall grass, and they sat back on their elbows.', 'LT was ten years old, and he’d only seen one falling star in his life. Not even his mother had seen this many at once, she said. Dozens visible at one time, zooming in from the east, striking the atmosphere like matches, white and orange and butane blue. The show went on, hundreds a minute for ten minutes, then twenty. He could hear his father working in the woodshop back by the garage, pushing wood through a whining band saw. Mom made no move to go get him, didn’t call for him.', 'LT asked for the popsicles they’d made yesterday and Mom said something like ', '. He ran to the freezer, lifted out the aluminum ice tray. The metal sucked at his fingertips. He jiggled the lever and freed one of the cubes, grape Kool-Aid on a toothpick, so good. That memory, even decades later, was as clear as the image of the meteors.', 'He decided to bring the whole tray with him. He paused outside the woodshop, finally pushed open the door. His father leaned over his bench, marking a plank with a pencil. He worked all day at the lumberyard and came home to work with scraps and spares. Always building something for the house, for her, even after it was too late to change her mind.', '“Did you see the sky?” LT asked him. “It’s like fireworks.”', 'LT didn’t have his mother’s gift for commanding attention. But his father followed him to the field, put his hands on his hips, tilted his head back. Wouldn’t sit on the blanket.', '“Meteorites,” his father said, and Mom said without looking back, “Meteoroid, in the void.”', '“What now?”', '“Meteoroid in the void. Meteorite, rock hound’s delight. Meteor, neither nor.”', 'LT repeated this to himself. ', '“Still looks like Revelations,” Dad said.', '“No,” his mother said. “It’s beautiful.”', 'The storm continued. LT didn’t remember falling asleep on the blanket, but he remembered jerking awake to a sound. Then it came again, a ', ' like a shot from a .22. Seconds later another clap, louder. He didn’t understand what was happening.', 'The sky had reversed: It was more white than black, pulsing with white fireballs. Not long streaks anymore, chasing west. No, the meteors were coming down at them, down upon their heads.', 'A meteor struck a nearby hill. A wink of light. LT thought, Now it’s a meteorite.', 'His father yanked him onto his feet. “Get inside.”', 'Then a flash, and the air shook. The sound was so loud, so close. He couldn’t see. His mother said, “Oh my!” as if it were nothing more surprising than a deer jumping across the road.', 'His father yelled, “Run to the fireplace!”', 'LT blinked spots from his vision. His father pushed him in the small of the back and he ran.', 'His father had built the fireplace himself, stacking the river rock, mortaring it with hand-stirred buckets of cement. It was six feet wide at the mouth, and the exposed chimney ran up the east wall, to the high timbered ceiling twenty-five feet above. Later, LT wondered if rock and mortar could have withstood a direct hit, but at that moment he had no doubt it would protect him.', 'The explosions seemed random; far away, then suddenly near, a boom that vibrated through the floorboards. It went on, an inundation, a barrage. His mother exclaimed with every report. His father moved from window to window, frowning and silent. LT wished he wouldn’t stand next to the glass.', 'Eventually, most of the strikes seem to be happening over the line of foothills, rolling west like a thunderstorm. His father insisted that no one sleep away from the lee of the chimney, so his mother assembled a bed for LT out of moving boxes, turning the emergency into a slumber party, an adventure. His father dragged furniture close: the couch for Mom and the recliner for him.', 'When his mother kissed him goodnight (the second time that night), he whispered, “Will you be here in the morning?”', '“I’ll wake you,” she said. LT could feel his father watching them.', 'It was the last time they would all sleep in the same room, or the same house.', '\\xa0', 'He opened his eyes, and for a long moment he couldn’t figure out why he was on the floor, in the living room. He stared stupidly at the empty bookshelves. His mother’s bookshelves.', 'Panic hit, and he sat up. He called, “Mom?”', 'Then he took in the piles of moving boxes still in the room, and began to calm down. He hadn’t missed her.', 'In the kitchen his father hunched over the table, staring at the portable black-and-white TV. Two cupboard doors showed empty shelves. The hooks above the stove seemed to gesture for their missing pots.', 'His father put an arm across LT’s shoulders without looking away from the TV.', 'The news was full of pictures of damaged buildings and forest fires. It was no ordinary meteor storm, and it wasn’t over. The onslaught had continued through the night and into the day, moving across the globe. The world spun eastward, and the meteors drummed into the atmosphere steady as a playing card against bicycle spokes. No one knew when it would end. The newsman called the storm “biblical,” the first time LT had heard that word outside of church, and warned about radioactivity. He knew ', ' word from comic books.', 'His father turned toward the window, pushed aside the drapes. A truck had pulled off the two-lane into their gravel drive. “Go tell your mother,” he said.', 'LT didn’t move. His stomach felt like ice.', '“Go. She’s in the backyard.”', 'LT walked out into a sky tinged with orange. If there were meteors up there he couldn’t see them. The air smelled like smoke.', 'He called for his mother. Checked the garage, where a pyramid of moving boxes filled the space, all sealed and labeled. Then he realized where she must be, and walked toward the cattle gate.', 'She stood at the far end of the field. He called again. She turned, beaming, something cupped in her hands. She strode toward him in her ruby cowboy boots, her yellow dress swishing high on her thighs. Then he realized what she carried.', '“Mom, no!”', 'She laughed. “It’s okay, my darlin’. It’s cooled off.”', 'She held it out to him. A black egg, flecked with silver, etched with spirals.', 'The meteor storm would go on for five more days and nights. Soon everyone would know the objects weren’t like other meteors. They weren’t chunks of stony iron ripped from a comet’s tail, or fragments of asteroids. They were capsules of woven metal, layered like an onion skin. They’d been bigger when in the void, but their outer shells had ignited and shredded in the atmosphere. The innermost shells remained intact until they slammed into the Earth. Almost all of them cracked on impact. People dug them up, showed them to television crews. Space seeds, they called them. And then the police started going house by house, confiscating them.', 'But not yet. At this moment, his mother was offering it to him. “Feel it,” she said. “It’s a miracle.”', 'He couldn’t deny her. The shell was surprisingly light. A jagged seam had opened along its top. Inside was darkness.', 'She said, “What do you think was in there?”', '\\xa0', 'When he was eleven years old, late in the first summer he’d spend in his mother’s tiny Chicago apartment, she smuggled home one of the fern men. It was four inches tall, planted in a paper coffee cup. Its torso was a segmented tube, like bamboo, glossy as jade. Its two arm-like stems ended in tiny round leaves, and its head was a mantis-green bulb like an unopened tulip.', '“Isn’t it illegal?” he asked her. But he knew the answer, and knew his mother. Her reckless instincts worried his young Puritan heart. He’d spent the school year alone in Tennessee with his father and had adopted his military rectitude.', '“It’ll be our little secret,” she said.', 'Ours and the boyfriend’s', ' LT thought.', '“You are crazy, honey,” said the boyfriend. He kissed her, hard, and when they finally broke apart she laughed. LT always thought of his mother as beautiful, but he’d been offended to discover that she was beautiful to others. To men. Like this shaggy ', ' who wore turquoise necklaces like a TV Indian and smelled like turpentine and cigarettes and scents he couldn’t yet name.', 'His mother went into a back closet to find a more durable container for the fern man.', '“I know what you’re thinking,” the shaggy man said.', 'But even LT didn’t know what he was thinking.', '“We should probably burn the little fucker, right?”', 'LT was alarmed, then embarrassed. Of course the boyfriend was right. At school, hallway posters showed spiky, ominous plants with the message ', ' Any sightings of invasive species were to be reported. The weeklong meteor storm had sprayed black and silver casings across millions of square miles in a broad band that circled the planet, peppering cities and fields and forests and oceans. Soldiers of every government seized what they could find. And when anything sprouted, good citizens called the authorities.', 'LT looked down at the fern man.', 'The boyfriend laughed. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to kill it. Your mom would kill ', '! Watch this.” He touched a finger to one of the fern’s arms. It curled away as if stung.', 'Mom said, “Don’t bother it, it’ll get tired and stop growing. That’s what the man told me.” She transferred the sprout to a ceramic pot with much cooing and fussing. “We can’t set him in the window,” she said. “Somebody might see.” LT picked a sunny spot on the coffee table.', '“He’s so cute,” his mother said.', '“That’s his survival strategy,” the boyfriend said. “So cute you won’t throw him out.”', '“Just like you,” she said, and laughed.', 'He didn’t laugh with her. His mood could change, quick. A lot of nights Mom and the boyfriend argued after LT had gone to bed—to bed but not to sleep.', '“We’re all doomed,” he said. “When the aliens come for the harvest, that’s it for ', '.”', 'This was the popular theory: that aliens had targeted Earth and sent their food stocks ahead of them so there’d be something to eat when they arrived. LT had spent long, hot days in the apartment listening to the boyfriend while Mom was at work, or else following him around the city on vague errands. He didn’t have a regular job. He said he was an artist—', '—but didn’t seem to spend any time painting or anything. He could talk at length about the known invasive species, and why there were so many different ones: the weblike filaments choking the trees in New Orleans, the flame-colored poppies erupting on Mexico City rooftops, the green fins popping up in Florida beach sand like sharks coming ashore. Every shell that struck Earth, and some that hit the surface of the water, cracked and sent millions of seeds into the air or into the oceans. Most of those seeds had not sprouted, or not yet. Of those that had, many of the vines and flowers and unclassifiable blooms soon withered and died. The ones that thrived had been attacked with poison, fire, and machetes. But—but!—there were so many possible sprouts that there was no way to find them all in the millions of acres of wilderness. Even if we managed to find and destroy ninety-nine percent of the invasives, the boyfriend had told LT once, there would be millions and millions of plants growing and reproducing around the globe.', 'Like the fern man. “We’re all going to die,” the boyfriend said, “because of this little green dude.”', 'And LT thought, How can something so beautiful, so ', ', be dangerous?', '“Let’s give him a name,” Mom said. “LT, you do the honors.”', '“I need to think about it,” he said.', '\\xa0', 'Or maybe, LT thought that night as his mother and the boyfriend whisper-yelled at each other, I should change my own name. Chicago was making him into a different person. He’d become conscious of his Tennessee accent, and had taken steps to tame his vowels. He’d eaten Greek food. He’d almost gotten used to being around so many black people. And he’d started staying up to all hours in his room, an L-shaped nook off the kitchen with a curtain for a door, reading from his mother’s collection of Reader’s Digest Condensed Books as the rattling fan chased sweat from his ribs. The night they got the fern man he wondered if he should ask everyone to stop calling him LT and start calling him Lawrence or Taylor or something completely of his own creation, like… Lance. Lance was the kind of guy who’d be ready when the UFOs came down.', 'Doors slammed, his mother sobbed loudly for a while, and then the apartment went quiet. LT waited another twenty minutes, and then got up to pee. He didn’t turn on the bathroom light. He was a night creature now, as light-sensitive as a raccoon.', 'The door to his mother’s bedroom was ajar. She was alone in the bed.', 'He went into the living room. On the wall behind the couch hung four of the boyfriend’s pictures. They were all of naked women turning into buildings, or maybe vice versa, with red-brick thighs and doorways for crotches and scaffolds holding up their torsos. One of the nudes, pale and thin and sprouting television aerials from her frizzy hair, looked too much like his mother. LT wondered if other people thought they were beautiful, or if beauty mattered in art with a capital A. The figures didn’t seem to be very convincing as women ', ' buildings. ', 'The fern man stood in the dark on the coffee table. Its bulb head drooped sleepily, and its stem arms hung at its sides. The torso leaned slightly—toward the window, LT realized.', 'He picked up the ceramic pot and set it on the sill, in a pool of streetlight. Slowly, the trunk began to straighten. Over the next few minutes, the head gradually lifted like a deacon finishing a prayer, and the round leaves at the ends of its arms unfurled like loosening fists. The movement was almost too incremental to detect; its posture seemed to shift only when he looked away or lost concentration.', 'Slow Mo, he thought. That’s what we’ll call you.', 'Tomorrow his mother would throw all the paintings out the front window, send them sailing into the street. LT would never see the boyfriend again. The fern man stayed.', '\\xa0', 'The night they heard about the thistle cloud, LT was daydreaming of burning the house down. It was March and he was bored to the point of paralysis, an old man in a thirteen-year-old body. Country winters stretched each night into a prison sentence. The valley went cave dark before suppertime, stayed dark until the morning school bus honked for him at the end of the lane. He longed for the city. Torching the place, he figured, would make a bonfire that would light up the road all the way to Chicago.', 'The place was wrong for his father, too. Three years after Mom had left, the house was purposeless without her in it, like a desanctified church. His father’s handiwork—the tongue and groove hardwood floors, the hand-turned legs on the kitchen table, the graceful stair rail that curled at the end like the tail of a treble clef—seemed as frivolous as gingerbread. Why stay here? They never used the dining room, or the guest room with its fancy bathroom. No one would ever thread a needle in the sewing room. LT and his father ate their meals in the living room, in front of the fire, wordless as Neanderthals.', 'LT was grateful when the TV said that a new invasive species had erupted in Tennessee. Dad was in his armchair as usual, eyes on the snowy screen of the portable, which he’d set on a chair close to the fireplace, as if daring it to melt.', '“Would you look at that,” Dad said.', 'LT did not look. He was sprawled on the couch, pretending to reread a book he hoped would annoy his father: ', '. There was an entire chapter on the bowerbirds of Papua New Guinea, whose males assembled and decorated elaborate bowers in hopes a female would prefer their art over the competitors’.', 'The third bachelor in the room was Mo. He was a sturdy three feet tall by then, and occupied the corner by the dark window. He was attracted to the fire. At night his limbs eased toward it, wanting the light if not the heat.', 'Mom couldn’t keep the fern. She’d moved in with a new, temperamental boyfriend, a restaurant owner who named a pasta dish after her the first week they dated, but flew into fits when he felt disrespected. Both Mo and LT had been causes of “friction” that summer, so LT begged to take the fern back to Tennessee in the fall. Mo had traveled in the back seat of his mom’s car like a passenger, bulbous head bent against the roof, a seat belt around his pot. LT hadn’t asked his father’s permission, and was surprised when he let it into his house without a fight. Dad was more upset by his son’s shaggy hair and the turquoise necklace around his neck. The day before school started, Dad drove him to the barber and ordered a buzzcut to match Dad’s own. LT kept the necklace under his shirt.', '“It’s getting worse and worse,” his dad said. “Lord almighty.”', 'Now LT did look at the TV. ', ' was as close to swearing as his father got.', 'The sky over Chattanooga was crowded with spiky black shapes. A reporter asked a question, and a man held out a bloody arm.', '“So much for dominion over the earth,” LT said. At the midweek prayer meeting—they went to services three times a week, twice on Sunday and once on Wednesday night—the pastor had launched into well-worn passages of God giving dominion of the earth to Adam. It came up whenever the invasives or women’s rights were in the news.', '“Don’t be smart,” Dad said.', '“Face it, we’re ', '” Every day the TV showed men in masks hacking down flowers as big as satellite dishes, or Argentinians fretting over alien moss that clung to the hooves of cattle like boots, or Kansas farmers dulling their chainsaws on traveling vines as tough as mahogany. In a lot of places the invasives were just a nuisance, but in some countries, especially the ones closest to the equator, the alien plants were causing real trouble. “They’re trying a million different strategies. All they need are a couple winners to drive us out.”', '“What are you talking about?”', '“Out-survive us. They’ve got time on their side. We go at animal speed, but plants move at their own speed. Wheels within wheels.” An Elijah reference, just to poke him. “It’s ', ' Dad.”', 'Another provocation. His father believed in the Bible. There was no time for natural selection in the six days of creation, and no need for it. Dad’s God didn’t improvise. He was a measure-twice-cut-once creator.', '“They’re better at surviving?” his father said. “These ', '”', 'LT shook his head as if disappointed in his father’s stupidity.', 'Dad slowly rose from his chair. LT realized he’d miscalculated. “Let’s see, then,” Dad said calmly. He gripped the sides of the ceramic pot, lifted it. It had to weigh almost two hundred pounds. Mo’s limbs curled inward.', 'LT yelled, “No! Stop it!”', 'His father turned the pot on its side. Dirt spilled onto the floorboards. He stepped toward the fire and pushed the top of the plant into the mouth of the fireplace.', 'LT threw himself into his father’s ribs. Stupid, useless. Dad was as squat and thick as an engine block. He turned, swinging Mo’s head out of the fireplace. It wasn’t on fire, but a haze of sizzling mist seemed to shroud the bulb.', 'LT burst into tears.', 'His father set the pot on the floor, anger gone now. “Aw, come on.”', 'LT ran upstairs, threw himself on the bed, awash with embarrassment and anger. He was thirteen! He should be tougher than this. Crying over a damn plant. He wanted it all to end. How much longer did he have to wait for the aliens to come and scrape this planet clean?', '\\xa0', 'The Chattanooga cloud was supposed to reach them that next afternoon. Vernon Beck, Dad’s oldest friend, drove over from Maryville to see it. Jumped out of his pickup and shook LT’s hand. “Goodness sakes, boy, you’re two feet taller! Hale, come say hello to LT and Mr. Meyers.”', 'A boy eased out of the passenger side of the pickup, long and lean, hair down to his shoulders. LT hadn’t seen Hale Beck since LT’s mother left. Their families used to go places together, and even though Hale was two years older than LT they got along like brothers. He remembered a long day riding water slides with Hale at a Pigeon Forge park. A hike in the Smokies during which Hale smashed a rock into a snake, the bravest thing LT had ever seen.', 'Hale shook hands with LT’s father, nodded at LT. Hale had gotten the growth spurt LT was still waiting on.', 'A strong wind was blowing but the cloud hadn’t shown up yet. The men went into the woodshop, and LT stood there awkwardly with Hale, unsure how to talk to him.', 'Hale took out a tin of Skoal from his back pocket, tucked a pinch of tobacco into his lip. He held out the tin, and LT shook his head. Hale leaned back on the hood of the truck. Spit black juice onto the gravel.', 'LT said, “We’ve got a fern man.”', '“A what?”', '“One of the invasives. Right in the house.” Dad said never to talk about the fern. But this was the Becks.', 'Hale said, “The one that moves?” He wanted to see that.', 'Dad had returned Mo to his usual spot. There was no visible damage from the flames. Hale said, “Looks like a regular plant.”', '“Watch this,” LT said. He stood between Mo and the window and raised his arms. The fern man slowly shifted to the right, back into the light. LT moved in front of him again and Mo moved opposite. “It’s called heliotropism. Like sunflowers? But way faster.”', '“Can I do it?” Hale asked.', '“Sure. Just don’t tire him out.”', 'Hale took LT’s position. They danced in slow motion at first, and then Hale sped up. Mo jerked and flopped in rhythm. Hale laughed. “He’s just like one of those windsock guys at the dealership!”', 'LT was thrilled that Hale was impressed, but nervous about hurting Mo. “Hey, you want to see where the space seed landed?”', 'He managed to entice Hale to the cattle field. The wind had picked up, turned cold, but the sun was bright and hot. Hale’s hair blew across his face, and he kept pushing it back.', 'They walked around at the far end of the field. LT couldn’t find the furrow the seed had made when it hit four years ago. The tall dry grass rattled with every gust.', 'Hale said, “Look.”', 'In the distance, a dark, churning cloud. Light flashed at the edges of it like tiny lightning. Hale ran toward it, into the wind. They plunged through a line of trees, into the next field—and suddenly the cloud loomed over them. Thousands of glistening tumbleweeds, most the size of a fist, a few big as soccer balls. A sudden downdraft sent scores of them plummeting into the trees. Most stuck in the treetops, others bounced down into the undergrowth, and half a dozen ricocheted back into the air and spun toward them.', '“Grab one!” Hale shouted. He pulled his T-shirt over his head in one quick move. His back was pale and muscled. LT felt a sudden heat and looked away, his heart pounding. Then Hale swung the shirt over his head, trying to snag a thistle ball. It floated just out of reach. He chased it, then jumped, jumped again. LT couldn’t take his eyes off the way his shoulders moved.', 'Then a lucky gust sent the ball down and the shirt caught against it. Hale hooted and LT cheered. The thing was hollow, a jumble of flat, silvery blades, thin as the wings of a balsa-wood glider, connected to each other by spongy joints which were decorated with thorns. Hale pulled his shirt free of them, and the cloth tore.', 'Then the sun dimmed, and they looked up. LT realized they’d only seen the front of the cloud, the first wave. Thousands and thousands more flew toward them, a spinning mass.', 'LT said, “Ho-lee shit.”', 'This struck Hale as hilarious, and then LT was laughing too, so hard he could barely stand. Then they ran, giggling and shouting.', '\\xa0', 'For months before his summer stay, when he was sixteen years old, LT begged his mother to take him to see the dragon tails of Kansas. Mom worked slow magic on her new husband, Arnaud, a thin, balding, control freak who made a lot of money as a chemical engineer. Eventually Arnaud came up with the idea that he should encourage LT’s interest in science and take them all to visit the most successful invasives in the Midwest. He rented an enormous RV and they drove southwest.', 'The first sign of the invasion came just past Topeka, when road crews waved them off the interstate. Arnaud eased the RV into the parking lot of a McDonald’s and said, “There you go.”', 'LT walked out of the RV, into sunlight and heat. At the edge of the lot rose an arch of deeply grooved bark. It emerged from the broken cement and came down about fifteen yards away in a field. Large purple leaf blades ran in single file atop the bark like the plates of a stegosaurus.', 'LT looked back at his mother. She beamed at him, then shooed him forward. He grabbed hold of the sturdy roots of the blades and pulled himself onto the base of the arch. A few careful steps more and he was upright, hands out for balance. The bark was a bit wider than his foot, but uneven. He knew from his books that the tail was not an ordinary trunk, but vines that had twisted around each other as they grew, only gradually adhering to share resources.', 'He reached the peak of the arch, eight feet off the ground. Twenty or thirty yards away, directly in front of him, another arch emerged, and another, like a sea monster coursing through an ocean of grass. No, one monster in a school of them. To either side, dozens and dozens of the dragon tails breached and dove. A group of them had burst up through the highway, and there was nothing manmade cement could do to keep them underground.', 'These were the aliens’ favorite trees, he thought. How could they not be? They were living architecture.', 'His mother called his name. She held the fancy, big-lensed camera Arnaud had bought her. She didn’t have to prompt LT to smile.', '\\xa0', 'The last night of the vacation, Arnaud drove to a campground set among the dragon tails, a farmer’s feeble attempt to recoup something from the land after agricultural disaster. As they ate dinner at the RV’s tiny table, LT showed his mother pictures from one of his books about the invasives. He told her how the dark fans held chlorophyll-like molecules that absorbed a larger spectrum of light than the Earth versions. “If our plants tried to process that much energy they’d burn up, like a car engine trying to run on rocket fuel.”', '“It’s a bit more complicated than that,” Arnaud said. He stood at the galley sink, washing the skillet he’d used to fry the hamburgers. “The photosystems they’re using seem to be variable, sometimes like retinol in archaea microbes, sometimes more like chlorophyll with novel sidechains added, so that they can control—”', '“Take a look at this,” LT said, cutting him off. He showed her a cross section of the dragon tail, and how the vines were twisted around each other. “They call them golden spirals. See, there’s this thing called the Fibonacci sequence—”', '“Dragon tails follow the golden spiral?” Arnaud said. He came over to the table. LT was pleased to know something the chemist didn’t.', 'Mom said, “What’s a Fibonacci?” and LT quickly answered. “It’s a series of numbers, starting with one, two, three, five… each one’s the sum of the previous two numbers, so—”', '“That’s a close approximation of the golden ratio,” Arnaud said. He pulled the book closer, leaned over LT’s mother. “The growth factor of the curve follows that ratio. You can see the spiral in nature—in seashells, pine cones, everywhere.”', '“So beautiful,” his mother said. She ran fingers over the glossy cross section. “Like the head of a sunflower.”', 'LT, suddenly furious, pushed himself out from behind the table. His mother said, “Where you going?”', 'Arnaud said, “Could you put away your plate?”', 'He let the door bang shut behind him.', 'Outside, the atmosphere was greenhouse humid. He marched away, not caring which direction his body took him. It was nine thirty and still not full dark, as if the sun couldn’t find the edge of these tabletop plains. The air was heavy with a floral perfume.', 'He came to the leaping back of a dragon trail, black against the purpling sky, and walked beside it. Gnats puffed out of the grass and he waved them away.', 'It had been a mistake to come on this trip. The RV was as stifling as a submarine. Arnaud sucked up all available oxygen, inserted himself into every conversation.', 'Eventually the dark came down, and he aimed for the fluorescent lights of the cinder-block building that doubled as park office and convenience store. Inside, a couple kids about his age, a boy and a girl, were glued to the Space Invaders cabinet. Were they brother and sister? Boyfriend and girlfriend? He thought about talking to them. He could tell them things. Like how the speed of the game was an accident; the aliens came down slow at first, then got faster and faster as their numbers were destroyed, not because it had been programmed that way, but because the processor could only speed up when the load lightened. ', ' was the only way he knew how to make small talk. Other forms of conversation were a mystery.', 'He bought a Coke and took it outside. Leaned against the wall under the snapping bug zapper.', 'A flashlight bobbed toward him out of the dark. He ignored it until a voice behind the light said, “Hello, my darlin’.”', 'His mother stepped up, clicked off the flashlight. “Did you see the stars? They’re amazing out here.”', '“Still no meteors,” he said. Six years after the seed storm, everybody was waiting for a second punch. Or maybe the next wave was on its way now, in the void, creeping across the light-years. Perhaps the long delay was necessary because of orbital mechanics. What looked like design could be just an accident of the environment.', 'He offered her a sip of his Coke. She waved it off. “You ought to give him a chance. He’s just enthusiastic about things. Like you are.”', 'He wanted to ask her why the hell she kept attaching herself to assholes. The self-involved painter, the rage-aholic restaurant owner, and now the chemist, whom she’d had the audacity to marry. Did she love him, or just his McMansion and its granite countertops?', '“He wants to send you to college,” she said. “He thinks you’d be a good scientist.”', '“Really?” Then he was embarrassed that the compliment meant something to him. “I’m not taking his money.”', '“You should think about it. Your dad can’t afford college. And you deserve better than working in a lumberyard.”', '“There’s nothing wrong with the lumberyard.” LT worked there three days a week during the school year, sometimes alongside his father. He’d told her he hated it, but hadn’t mentioned the things he loved about it. His herky-jerky forklift. The terrifying Ekstrom Carlson rip saw. The sawdust and sweat.', 'But did he want to be there the rest of his life?', 'From inside the store, the boy shouted in mock dismay and the girl laughed. They’d lost their last laser cannon.', '“You should study the invasives,” his mother said. “I remember that look on your face when I showed you that seed. And the fern man! You loved that little guy.”', '“I still have him. Dad keeps him in the living room. He’s not so little.”', '“So,” she said. “Think about it.”', 'He thought, If the aliens haven’t landed by then.', '\\xa0', '“What?”', '“SPACE BEES!” LT shouted above the music. “WHERE ARE THEY?”', 'He was drunk, and Jeff and Wendy too, and their new friend Doran, all of them drunk together. What else could they be, on this final weekend before Christmas break, and where else but at the Whitehorse, which as far as he was concerned was the only bar in Normal, Illinois.', '“Jesus Christ,” Jeff said. “Not the bees again.”', 'LT put his hand on the back of Doran’s neck—a sweaty neck, and his hand tacky with beer but he didn’t care, he wanted to pull Doran close. “I need to tell you things,” he said into his ear, and Doran laughed, and then—', '—and then they were in a restaurant booth, the lights bright, Jeff and Wendy across from him and Doran—tall, sturdy Doran—beside him. LT leaned into his arm woozily. God he was handsome, naturally handsome, almost hiding it. How did they get here? He concentrated, but his memory of the past two hours was a hopscotch, dancing drinking shouting singing and then the rude bright lights of last call and a flash of ice and cold—did Wendy drive, she must have—to ', ' the 24-hour Steak and Shake, their traditional sober-up station.', 'He said to Doran, “It’s the flowers that make no sense.”', 'Jeff said, “The flowers have no scents?” and Wendy said, “It’s that they have scents that makes no sense.” They both laughed.', 'A beat too late LT realized there was wordplay at work. He forged on. “The blooms of flowers are ', '” The word thick on his tongue. “Scent and shape and color, they all evolved to attract specific pollinators, the bees and butterflies and beetles.”', '“Oh my,” Jeff said.', '“And you told me he was shy,” Doran said.', '“He can get wound up,” Wendy said. “When he feels comfortable.”', '“Or tipsy,” Jeff said.', 'LT felt tipsy ', ' comfortable. Why hadn’t Jeff and Wendy introduced him to Doran before now? Why wait until the last weekend of the last semester LT would be on campus? It was criminal.', '“A pretty flower isn’t just a simple announcement, like ‘Here’s pollen.’” LT said. “Simple won’t do it.” He tried to explain how flowers were in competition. Pollen was everywhere, nestled inside thousands of equally needy plants desperate to spread their genetic material. What was needed was not an announcement but a flashing neon sign. “The flower’s goal,” LT said, “is to figure out what ', ' think are beautiful.”', '“Slow down, Hillbilly,” Wendy said. “Eat something.”', '“Hummingbirds have an aesthetic sense?” Doran said.', '“Of course they do! Have I told you about bowerbirds?”', 'Jeff said, “Guess what his honors thesis is on?”', 'And then he was off, yammering about the bowerbirds of Papua New Guinea. The males of the species constructed elaborate twiggy structures, not nests but bachelor pads, designed purely to woo females. The Vogelkop Bowerbird set out careful arrangements of colors—blue, green, yellow—each one a particular hue. It didn’t matter what the objects were; they could be stones, or petals, or plastic bottle caps even, as long as they were the correct shade. The females could not be coerced into sex; they dropped by the bowers, perused the handiwork, and flew away if they found them substandard. Their choice of mates, their taste in', ', drove the males over millennia to evolve more and more specific displays, an ongoing gallery show with intercourse as the prize.', '“Wait,” Doran said. “That doesn’t mean they’re making an artistic choice. Aren’t they just, uh, instinctually responding to whoever seems like the fittest mate? It’s not beauty ', '—”', '“I love ', ',” Jeff said. “Great word.”', '“I’ve always been fond of ', ',” Wendy said.', '“But it is aesthetics!” LT said. “Beauty’s just”—he made explosion fingers—“joy in the brain, right? A flood of chemicals and, and, and—” What was the word? “Fireworks. Neuronal fireworks. We don’t ', ' our way to beauty, it hits us like a fucking hammer.”', '“Ipso facto,” Jeff said.', 'Doran put his arm around LT’s shoulder and said, “Eat your burger before it gets cold, then tell me about the space bees.” Ah! He remembered! The heat of Doran’s arm across his neck made his cheeks flush. Doran smelled of sweat and Mennen Speed Stick and something else, something LT could almost recall from far back in his brain, from a hot afternoon in a Chicago apartment… but the memory slipped the net.', 'He decided to eat. Wendy told the story of her favorite snowmobile accident. Doran, who’d grown up in New Mexico, couldn’t believe that Wisconsin teenagers were allowed to ride machines across frozen lakes.', 'LT began to feel a little more sober, though perhaps that was an illusion. “Space bees,” he said.', '“I’m ready,” Doran said. “Lay it on me.”', '“Every one of the invasives we’ve found, not a single one uses pollination. There’s a lot of budding and spores and wind dispersal and”—he waved a clutch of fries—“you know. I’ve got a fern man at home, it’s like ten feet tall now—”', '“You do?”', 'But LT didn’t want to talk about home. “Doesn’t matter, it just grows and spreads, spilling out of its pot, but it doesn’t require animal assistance.” Actually, he wasn’t sure that was true. Didn’t the fern survive because of him, because of his family? It had played on their human tendency for anthropomorphism.', '“Where’d you go, Hillbilly?” Wendy asked.', '“Sorry, what did you say?” he asked Doran.', '“I said, maybe all the pollinating species died.”', '“Maybe! But why colorful flowers and no pollen? There weren’t any animals hatching from the space seeds, so—”', 'Doran’s eyes went wide. “They have to be designed, then.”', '“Exactly!”', 'Wendy nabbed his glass before it tumbled over.', '“Inside voices,” she said.', 'He gets it, LT thought. The aliens could know what Earth’s sunlight was like from very far away, even guess the composition of its atmosphere and soil, but they couldn’t know what animals would be here, much less humans. So they had to design plants that could propagate without them.', '“But if they’re designed, why are they so, so ', '” LT asked. “Those huge fucking umbrellas out west, the sponges smothering South America, all of them crazy-colorful and smelly and weird. So my real question is—”', '“Where are the space bees?” Jeff supplied.', '“Wrong!” LT said. The real question was the one he was born to answer. He’d get whatever degrees and training he needed, he’d go into the field for evidence, he’d write the books to explain it. He’d explain it to Doran.', '“The question is, why all this needless beauty? What’s it all for?”', '“I don’t know, but ', ' beautiful,” Doran said, and then—', '—and then morning, a thumping that wasn’t in his head. Or not all in his head.', 'LT sat up, and pain spiked in his skull. Light blasted through half-open blinds. And there, beside him, Doran. Mouth agape, rough-jawed, one arm across LT’s waist.', 'Still there. Still real.', 'He wanted to fall back into the bed, pull that arm across his chest. Then the knocking came again, and he realized who was at the front door.', '“Fuck.” He slipped out from under Doran’s arm without waking him, pulled on shorts. Alcohol sloshed in his bloodstream. He closed the bedroom door behind him. The pounding resumed.', 'LT pulled open the front door. His father started to speak, then saw what shape his son was in. Shook his head, suddenly angry. No, angri', '.', '“I overslept,” LT said.', '“Are you packed?”', 'LT turned to look at the living room, and his father pushed past him.', '“Dad! ', ' Could you just ', '”', 'His father surveyed the moving boxes, only a few of them taped up. The rest were open, half-filled. LT’s plan had been to wake up early and finish packing. Everything had to go. Next semester he’d finish his coursework in the mountains of western New Guinea, collecting data on how birds had adapted to invasives. And now all he wanted to do was stay here, in central Illinois, in this apartment.', '“Wait for what?” his father asked. “For ', '”', 'LT moved between his father and the bedroom. “Give me an hour. Go for lunch or something. There’s a diner—”', '“I’ll start taking down what’s packed. There’s snow coming.”', '“No. Please. Just… give me some time.”', 'His father looked at the bedroom door. Then at his son. His jaw tightened, and LT stopped himself from edging backward.', 'He’d lived his boyhood afraid of his father’s anger. Power, he’d learned, came not from ', ', but demonstrating that you were barely containing it. You won by exacting dread, by making your loved ones wait through the silence so long that they yearned for the explosion.', '“In an hour I drive away,” his father said.', '\\xa0', 'LT didn’t relax until they stepped off the plane in Columbus. Doran kept trying to calm him down, to no effect. The entire trip he’d been imagining that some authority would command the pilot to turn around, send them back to Indonesia. A priest would tell them, Stupid Americans, gays aren’t allowed to be parents, and they would yank the infant out of his hands.', 'Then he emerged from the boarding tunnel holding the baby, saw his mother, and they both burst into tears.', 'He eased his daughter into his mother’s arms. “Mom, this is Christina. Christina, this is—what is it, again?” Teasing her.', '“Mimi!” She pressed her face close to the tiny girl and whispered, “I’m your Mimi!”', 'A tanned, smiling man with a tidy black goatee offered his hand. “Congratulations, LT. You’ve made your mother very, very happy.” This was Marcus, Mom’s brand-new husband, five years younger than her, at least. His mother at forty-six was still lithe and alarmingly sexy. LT hadn’t met Husband 3.0 before, didn’t know Mom was bringing him. He felt a flash of annoyance that he had to deal with this intruder at this moment—but then told himself to let it go. The day was too big for small emotions.', 'Doran, holding two duffel bags, one in each arm, said, “We made it.”', 'LT kissed him, hard. In New Guinea they hadn’t dared engage in PDA. “Eighteen years to go.”', 'Christina nestled like a peanut in the high-tech shell of the car seat. As Marcus drove them home, LT and Doran talked about how dicey the whole process had been. The orphanage, situated about thirty miles from Jayapura, was overcrowded, with hundreds of children left there by the crisis. The facility was nominally run by nuns, but most of the staff were local women who seemed little better off than their charges. LT and Doran had been practicing their Indonesian, especially the phrases involving gift-giving.', '“We had to bribe everybody, top to bottom,” Doran said. “If it wasn’t for LT’s friend at the university yelling at them they’d have taken the shirts off our backs.”', '“It’s not their fault,” LT said. “Their agriculture is wrecked. The economy’s crashing. They’re starving.”', '“Maybe they should stop chewing those sugar sticks.”', '“What now?” his mother asked.', 'He told her how the locals seemed almost addicted to an invasive plant that tasted sweet, but could not be digested. Gut bacteria couldn’t break down those strange peptides and so passed it along through the colon like a package that couldn’t be opened.', 'Doran said, “It would be great for my diet.”', 'A joke, but what Doran had seen there had scared him, and even LT, who’d spent months on the island doing fieldwork for his PhD, had been shaken by the rapid decline in the country. Thousands of alien species had been growing in the forests for two decades, ignored and unchecked, and suddenly some tipping point had been reached and those alien plants had reached the cities. The latest was a thread-thin vine that exploded into a red web on contact with flat surfaces. Villages and towns were engulfed by scarlet gauze. In the orphanage, nurses scraped it from the walls, but that only made it worse, dispersing its spores. He and Doran were terrified it was in Christina’s lungs. Invasives might be indigestible, but so was asbestos. In the morning she’d have her first doctor’s appointment. Her papers all said she was healthy, without birth defects, and up-to-date on her vaccinations, but they weren’t about to trust an orphanage under duress.', 'Once they reached the apartment, LT still couldn’t bear to put down his daughter. While Doran mixed formula and made beds and ordered takeout, LT fed his daughter, changed her, and then let her fall asleep on his chest.', 'His mother sat beside him on the couch. “You’re going to have to let Doran do more parenting.”', '“He can fight me for her.”', '“Big talk for the first night. Wait till sleep deprivation hits.”', 'Christina’s eyes were not quite closed, her lips parted. Mom had to know that he’d strong-armed Doran into adoption. His last trip to New Guinea, LT had been haunted by the abandoned children. Doran had said, This is crazy, we’re not even thirty, and LT said, My parents were teenagers when they had me, and Doran said, You’re making my case.', 'But that argument was over forever the moment Doran met Christina.', '“You used to look just like that,” his mother said. “Milk-drunk.”', 'She was four weeks old, living through the days of extreme fractions. In another month, she’d have been their daughter for half her life. In a year, she would have been an orphan for only a twelfth of it. And yet those four weeks would never disappear. There would always be some shrinking percentage of her life that she’d lived alone, a blot like a tiny spore. He’d read alarming articles about adopted children who’d failed to “attach.” What if the psychic damage was already done? What if she never felt all the love they were bombarding her with?', 'His mother called Marcus over. “Sweetie, show them what you brought.”', 'Marcus opened a wooden box lined with cut paper and lifted out a teardrop-shaped dollop of glass, about eight inches long and six inches wide at the base, purple and red and glinting with gold.', '“A crystal for Christina,” he said.', '“That is ', '” Doran said. “You made this?”', '“Marcus is an award-winning glassblower,” his mother said. She tilted her head. “He made me these earrings.”', 'Of course, LT thought. His mother had always loved bowerbirds.', 'The gift was very pretty, and pretty useless, too heavy for a Christmas ornament, and not a shape that could sit upright on a shelf. They’d have to hang it, but not above her bed.', '“Which ear is she supposed to wear it in?” LT asked.', 'Marcus laughed. “Either one. She’ll have to grow into it.”', 'When the food arrived, LT needed to eat, and he was forced to surrender Christina to Doran. His body moved automatically as he held her, a kind of sway and jiggle that soothed her. Where did he learn that?', 'Mom said, “Did you call your father?”', 'And like that, the spell was broken. LT said, “What do you think?”', '“I think you should.”', '“Fuck him.”', '“Hey,” Doran said.', '“Right. I gotta stop swearing. Eff that guy.”', '“Your mom’s right. We should give him a chance.”', '“He’s had six years of chances. Any time he wants to call, I’ll pick up.” There were a few years, after college, when they talked on the phone and his father would pretend that LT lived alone. He never asked about Doran, or about their lives. Then LT sent his father an invitation to the commitment ceremony. The next time LT called, his father said that he was disgusted, and didn’t want to talk to him until he fixed his life.', 'His mother said, “This is different. Maybe it’s time.”', 'Maybe. He got up from the table.', 'Time itself had become different. He looked at Christina in Doran’s arms and thought, I’m going to know you for the rest of my life. The future had broken open, his week-by-week life suddenly stretching to decades. He could picture her on her first day of school, on prom night, at her wedding. He caught a glimpse of her holding a baby as tiny as she was at that moment.', 'Had his father felt that way, too, when he was born?', 'He kissed Doran’s cheek, then bent over their daughter. She was awake, dark-eyed, watching both of them. He thought, There’s no way I can go away for six months into the jungle and leave her. He wouldn’t make the choice his parents had made.', '“We’ll give it a shot,” LT said. He moved his cheek across her warm head. Inhaled her scent. “Won’t we, my darlin’?”', '\\xa0', 'He was reading to Christina and Carlos when the call came. Or rather, Christina was reading while LT held the book, because Christina said he was only allowed to do the Hagrid and Dumbledore voices. Carlos, five years old, lolled at the end of the bed, seemingly oblivious but missing nothing.', 'Doran came to the bedroom holding the cordless. “Some guy wants to talk to you. He says he’s a friend of your father’s.”', 'The thick Tennessee accent opened a door to his childhood. Vernon Beck, hearty as ever. He apologized for bothering LT “up there in D.C.,” but he was worried about LT’s father. “He stopped coming to work. He didn’t quit, just stopped coming. Same with church. He won’t answer the phone at all.”', '“Is he sick? Did he get hurt at the yard?”', '“I went over there, and he finally came out to the porch. He said he was fine, just wanted folks to leave him alone. But I don’t know. It ain’t like him.”', 'They talked a few minutes more. Mr. Beck apologized again for bothering him, explained how he got his number from a cousin. LT reassured him that it was all right. Asked about his son, Hale, who turned out to be doing fine, still in Maryville, working maintenance for the hospital. Had a wife and four children, all boys.', 'LT thought about that day they ran from the thistles. Funny how you don’t know the last day you’ll see someone. He’d spent the rest of that winter when he was thirteen daydreaming about Hale, his first big crush. He didn’t mention that to Mr. Beck, and Mr. Beck didn’t ask about LT’s husband, or children. Southern Silence.', '“One more thing,” Mr. Beck said. “Your dad, he’s let things go. You should be ready for that.”', 'Doran asked, “What happened to your father?”', '“Maybe nothing. But I think I have to go lay eyes on him.”', 'Christina said, “I want to lay eyes on him!”', '“Me too, kiddo,” Doran said. “But not like this.”', '“Can we ', ' now?” Carlos asked.', 'Doran didn’t want LT to travel south. All those famine refugees landing in Florida, and the citizen militias in Texas and New Mexico. LT said his Department of Agriculture credentials would get them through any checkpoint, and besides, Tennessee was nowhere near the trouble. “It’s like going into Wisconsin,” LT said, quoting one of their favorite movies. “In and out.”', '“Fine,” Doran said, “but why not just call the local police, let them check it out?” But LT didn’t want to embarrass Dad, or get him fined if he wasn’t taking care of the house.', '“I owe him this much,” LT said. And Doran said, “You think so?”', 'Doran stayed home with Carlos, and LT and Christina left before sunrise the next morning with a cooler full of food so they wouldn’t have to depend on roadside restaurants. Christina fell asleep immediately, slept through all the phone calls he made to the Department, and woke up outside of Roanoke. He put away the phone and they listened to music and he pointed out invasives and native plants alongside the interstate. They were driving through the battlefield of a slow-motion war. Old native species were finding novel ways to fight the aliens—sucking resources from them underground, literally throwing shade above—and new invasives kept popping up into ecological niches. “It’s all happening so incrementally,” he told her, “it’s hard to see.”', '“Like global warming,” Christina said. He’d let her read the opening chapter of the book he was working on, and had taken her to see the Al Gore movie, so she understood boiling frogs. This had been his job for the past decade at the Department of Agriculture: explainer-in-chief, interpreter of policy, sometimes influencer of it. He missed the fieldwork, and longed to do original research again, but the government desk job provided stability for his family.', '“Remember what I told you about animal speed?” he said. “Plant speed, and ', ' speed, that’s just a hard timescale for us mammals to keep our attention on.”', '“I know. Wheels within wheels.”', '“Exactly.”', 'After a day of driving and a two-hour wait for inspection at the Tennessee border, they entered the foothills. His hands knew the turns. He remembered the long drive home that last day of college—and realized for the first time that his father must have had to leave the hills at one in the morning to get to Illinois State by noon, and then had turned around and driven all the way back the same day. Drove it in silence, with a hungover, secretly heartbroken boy sulking in the passenger seat.', 'They pulled into the long gravel drive and parked beside the house. Christina said, “You used to live ', '”', '“Be nice. Your grandfather built this house.”', '“No, it’s cool! It looks like a fairy castle.”', 'His childhood home was being overrun in the same slow, grasping process that had swallowed Christina’s village. The backyard grass, ordinary and native, had grown knee high. But covering the wall of the house was a flat-leafed ivy, brilliant and slick-looking as the heart of a kiwi fruit; definitely an invasive. Was this war, or détente?', 'Ivy also covered the back door. He tore away a clear space, and knocked. Knocked again. Called out, “Dad! It’s LT!”', 'He tried the door, and it swung open. “Wait here,” he said to Christina. He didn’t want her to see anything horrible.', 'The kitchen lights were off. There were dishes in the sink, a pair of pots on the stove.', 'He called for his father again. His toe snagged on something. A vine, snaking across the floor. No, many vines.', 'He stepped into the living room—and froze. Ivy covered everything. A carpet of green clung to the walls. The fireplace burst with green foliage, and the tall stone altar of the chimney had become a trellis. Vines curled through doorways, snaked along the stair rails. Greenish sunlight filtering through the leaf-covered windows made the room into an aquarium. The air was jungle thick and smelled of fruiting bodies.', 'He stepped closer toward the fireplace, spied dots of white and red nestled into the leaves. Was the ivy ', '?', '“What are you doing here?”', 'LT startled. The voice had come from behind him.', '“Dad?”', 'His father sat in his armchair, nestled into the vines. Leaves draped his shoulders like a shawl. He wore a once-white UT Vols sweatshirt that seemed too big for him. His hair was shaggy, a steel gray that matched the stubble on his face. He looked too thin, much older than he should. LT felt as if he’d been catapulted through time. He hadn’t seen or spoken to this man for almost twenty years, and now he wasn’t even the same person.', 'His father said, “Who’s this?”', 'LT thought, ', 'and then realized that Christina had come into the room.', 'She was looking up at the walls, the high ceiling, slowly turning to take it all in. “Dad…” Her voice was strange.', '“It’s okay, honey, there’s nothing to be—”', '“This is ', '”', 'She lifted her hands to her head as if to contain the shock. A sound like applause erupted around the room. The leaves were shaking.', 'She looked at the corner, then up. “Dad, do you see it?”', 'He could, a green shape against the green. Enmeshed in leaves, an oak-thick stalk rose up in the corner. At the top, a bulbous head a yard wide was bent against a cross-timber, so that it seemed to be looking down at them. Its right arm stretched across the room, where broad leaves splayed against the wall as if holding it up. Its other arm hung down. Finger leaves brushed the floor.', '“Holy fucking––”', '“', '” Christina chided. She walked toward the plant. Lifted her hands above her head. The leaves of its arms rattled like a hundred castanets.', 'She laughed, and bent at the waist. Slow Mo’s huge head eased left, then right.', 'LT’s father said, “Isn’t he a lovely boy?”', '\\xa0', 'Geological time, plant time, animal time… and inside that, yet another, smaller wheel, spinning fast. His father’s body had become a container for cells that lived and replicated and mutated at frightening speed.', 'On the second morning at Blount Memorial Hospital, Christina sat at the edge of her grandfather’s bed, curled her fingers around his (carefully not disturbing the IV tubes taped to the top of his hand), and said, “I read a pamphlet about colon cancer. Would you like me to tell you about it?”', 'His father laughed. “Are you going to be a scientist like your father?” He was remarkably cheery, now that equipment had rehydrated him and delivered a few choice opioids.', 'She shook her head. “I want to be a real doctor.”', 'LT, listening to on-hold music on his cell, said, “Hey!”', 'Doran came back on the line. “Okay, I got him an appointment with Lynn’s oncologist. Bring him here. I’ll move Carlos into Christina’s room.”', '“Are you sure about this?”', '“I would only do this for my favorite person. Besides, I don’t think anybody else is stepping up. You’re an only child, right?”', '“Uh, kind of.” He’d have to explain later.', 'He gave Christina a five and told her to sneak some ice cream into the room. “He likes rocky road, but chocolate will do.”', 'His father watched her go. “She reminds me of your mother.”', 'LT thought, Sure, this tiny, dark-haired, brown-skinned girl is ', ' much like your blonde, dancer-legged wife.', '“I mean it,” his father said. “When she looks at me—it was like that with Belinda. That light.”', '“Dad—”', '“All the boys in that school, and she chose me.”', '“Dad, I need to tell you some things.”', '“I’m not leaving the house.”', '“You can’t go back there. I had Mr. Beck check it out. There are roots running through the floorboards, wrapped around the pipes. The wiring’s been shorted out. You’re lucky the place didn’t burn down.”', '“It’s my house. You can’t tell me—”', '“No, it’s Mo’s house now. It’s been his for years.”', '\\xa0', 'On that last Thanksgiving he hosted in the Virginia house, the topic of conversation was, appropriately enough, food.', '“We haven’t published yet, but the data’s solid,” Christina said. “We’ve got an eater.”', 'Cheers went up around the table. “Were you using the cyanobacteria?” LT asked. Just a few months ago, her gene-hacking team at McGill was making zero progress. “Or one of the Rhodophyta?”', '“Let the woman speak!” LT’s mother said. Christina, sitting beside her, squeezed her arm and said, “Thanks, Mimi.”', '“She needs no encouragement,” Christina’s husband said, and Carlos laughed.', '“Here’s the amazing thing—we didn’t engineer it. We found the bacteria in the wild. Evolving on its own.”', '“You’re kidding me,” LT said.', 'Christina shrugged. “It turns out we should have been paying more attention to the oceans.”', 'LT tried not to hear this as a rebuke. As the USDA’s deputy secretary, he orchestrated the research grants, helped set the agenda for managing the ongoing crisis. It was a political job more than a scientific one, and much of the time the money had to go into putting out fires. So even though everyone knew that most of the seeds had gone down in water, the difficulty in retrieving them meant that almost all the research on water-based invasives focused on ones near the surface: the white pods like bloated worms floating in Lake Superior, the fibrous beach balls bobbing in the Indian Ocean, the blue fans that attached themselves to Japanese tuna like superhero capes.', 'Christina said that the bacteria were found feeding on rainbow mats. The scientific community had missed the explosion of translucent invasives hovering in the ocean’s photic zone, until they linked and rose to the surface in a coruscating, multi-colored mass. The satellite pictures of it were lovely and terrifying. The alien plants were so efficient at sucking up carbon dioxide, in a few decades of unrestricted growth they could put a serious dent in global warming—while maybe killing everything else in the ocean.', 'But somehow, fast-evolving Earth organisms were trying to eat them first. Or at least, one species of them. But if one Earth organism had figured it out, maybe others had, too.', '“You have to tell us how they’re breaking down those peptides,” LT said.', '“Or not,” Carlos said.', '“I have a story,” said Bella, Christina’s four-year-old daughter. “During craft time, this girl Neva? It was a ', '”', '“Wait your turn, darling,” Aaron said. Christina’s husband was a white man from Portland. He ran cool to Christina’s hot, which was good for Bella.', 'Through some quasi-Lamarckian process, LT’s children, and his children’s children, had inherited his most annoying conversational tendency. On Thanksgiving they didn’t go around the table saying what they were thankful for, but rather took turns explaining things to each other. Nothing made LT happier. All he wanted in the world was this: to be surrounded by his family, talking and talking. Much of the world was in dire shape, but they were rich enough to afford the traditional dry turkey breast, the cranberry sauce with the ridges from the can, sweet potato casserole piled with a layer of marshmallow.', '“You know what this means,” Christina said. She caught LT’s eye. “Next year we’ll be eating sugar sticks like the aliens did.”', 'Perhaps only LT understood what she meant. Homo sapiens are only ten percent human; most of the DNA in their bodies comes from the tiny flora that they carry inside themselves to digest their food and perform a million tiny tasks that keep them alive. If humans could someday adopt these new bacteria into their microbiome, a host of invasives could become edible. It would be the end of the famine.', 'She saw the wonder in his face, and laughed. “Wheels within wheels, Dad.”', 'After dinner, the urge to nap descended like a cloud, and only little Bella was immune. Carlos offered to take her to the park, but LT said he would like that honor.', '“Where the slides are?” she asked.', '“All the slides,” he said. “Just let me tuck in Mimi.”', 'He led his mother to the master bedroom, which was on the ground floor and had the best mattress. She moved carefully, as if hearing faint music in the distance, but at eighty she was still sharp, still beautiful, still determined to stay up with fashion. Her hair was three different shades of red.', '“Eighty-five outside,” she said, “and in here it’s a Chicago winter.”', '“I’ll get an afghan,” he said, and opened the closet. When he turned around, she was sitting on the edge of the bed, one hand out on the coverlet.', '“You must miss Doran.”', 'The knot that he carried in his chest tightened a fraction. He nodded.', '“It’s not fair,” she said. “All our men dying so young.”', '“Arnaud’s still alive,” LT said. “At least he was last year. He sent me a Christmas card.”', '“Good God, what an asshole,” she said. “It’s true what they say, then.”', '“I was the teenage asshole. I don’t know how anybody put up with me.”', 'She lay down and folded her hands across her chest like Cleopatra. He spread the afghan so that it covered her feet.', '“This is a lovely house,” she said.', '“It’s too big for me now. Unless you move in.”', '“I prefer living on my own these days. I do my painting in the nude, you know.”', '“You do not.”', '“But I ', ' That’s the point.”', 'Bella was waiting for him by the front door. “Papa!”', '“Ciao, Bella!”', 'She jumped into his arms. It was a pleasure to be someone’s favorite person again, at least for the moment. “Ready for the slides?”', 'He wished she didn’t live so far away. He wished he wasn’t so busy. People were making noises about nominating him for secretary, but he could say no, get off the treadmill. He could move to Canada and be close to Christina and Aaron and Bella, finally finish the book. Make one more research trip. He’d like to visit New Guinea again, see how the land of his daughter was faring. Fifty-three years after the meteor storm, and there were still so many questions to answer, and so many new things to see.', 'He carried Bella out into the Virginia heat. Soon he’d have to put her down, but he wanted to carry her as long as he could, as long as she let him. “So,” he said to her. “What’s all this about a disaster at craft time?”', '\\xa0', 'The house was full of strangers. They kept touching his shoulder, leaning down into his face, wishing him happy birthday. Ninety-seven was a ridiculous age to celebrate. Not even a round number. They thought he wouldn’t make it to ninety-eight, much less a hundred. They’d probably been waiting for years for him to kick off, and this premature wake was the admission of their surrender.', 'A tiny gray-haired woman sat beside him. Christina. “You have to see this,” she said. She held a glass case, and suspended inside it was a glossy black shape flecked with silver. “It’s from the current Secretary of Agriculture. ‘For forty-five years of service to the nation and the world.’ This one came from Tennessee. You remember telling me about Mimi finding a seed?”', 'There was an ocean of days he couldn’t remember, but that day he recalled clearly. “Rock hound’s delight,” he said softly.', '“What’s that, Dad?”', 'Ah. The strangers were watching, waiting for a proper response. He cleared his throat, and said loudly, “So have those alien bastards shown up yet?”', 'Everyone laughed.', 'The afternoon stretched on interminably. Cake, singing, talking, so much talking. He asked for his jacket and a familiar-looking stranger brought it to him, helped him out of his chair. “I have to tell you, sir, your books made me want to be a scientist. ', ' was the first—”', 'LT lifted a hand. “Which way is the backyard?” He could still walk on his own. He was proud of that.', 'Outside, the sky was bright, the air too warm. He didn’t need his coat, after all. He stood in a garden, surrounded by towering trees. But whose garden, whose house? It wasn’t his home in Virginia, that was long gone. Not Chicago or Columbus. Was this Tennessee?', 'Everything moves too fast, he thought, or else barely moves at all.', '“Papa?”', 'A young woman, holding the hand of a little girl. The girl, just three or four years old, held a huge black flower whose petals were edged with scarlet.', '“Ciao, Bella!” he said to the girl.', 'The woman said, “No, Papa, this is Annie. I’m Bella.”', 'A stab of embarrassment. And wonder. Bella was so old. How had that happened? How had he gotten so far from home? He wanted to do it all over again. He wanted Doran’s shoulder next to him, and tiny Christina in his arms. He wanted Carlos on his shoulders at the National Zoo. All of it, all of it again.', '“It’s okay, Papa,” Bella said. His tears concerned her. What a small, common thing to worry about.', 'He inclined his head toward the little girl. “My apologies, Annie. How are you doing this afternoon? Did you fly all the way from California?”', 'She let go of her mother’s hand and approached him. “I have a flower.”', '“Yes, you do.”', '“It’s a pretty flower.”', '“It certainly is.”', 'Bella said, “She likes to tell people things.”', 'The girl offered the flower to him. Up close, the black petals seemed to ripple and shift. Their dark surfaces swirled with traceries of silver that caught the light and spun it prettily. He raised it to his nose and made a show of sniffing it. The little girl laughed.', 'Words were not required. Sometimes the only way you could tell someone you loved them was to show them something beautiful. Sometimes, he thought, you have to send it from very far away.', '“Where did you find this lovely flower?” he asked.', 'She pointed past his shoulder. He could feel the tower of green behind him.

When a group of humans are killed, the question is who is responsible and why.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The wind was blowing sharply from the east, across the north European plain from Siberia to the flatlands of East Anglia. Despite that, Helen Matthias was perspiring through her running suit by the time she finished her usual morning circuit of the Lakenwell Airbase perimeter. After two years, she was getting used to the winters here. They felt harsher than the ones she remembered as a kid in Massachusetts, and the snow usually came later, after the turn of the year. This morning she thought she could detect the faint scent of ice in the air. Was that a little hello from Siberia? Prasanna would have told her it was all in her head; if so, her imagination was especially strong today.', 'Maybe she should ask the donkeys, Helen thought, waving to the one plodding toward her on the perimeter road. When she had passed it earlier, it had automatically moved to one side, putting itself between her and the electrified fence to reduce her risk of accidentally stumbling into it; safety first. The donkey was still keeping to one side; maybe Felipe Dos had told it to expect more traffic.', 'Why people called them ', ' was a mystery to Helen; they looked more like a collection of welded-together toolboxes on four legs. There was no head; front and back were determined by their direction of travel. The roboticists claimed it was a matter of convenience. Helen told them robots that lacked the concept of backwards as humans understood it was one of those supposedly little things that could very well bite them in the ass later.', 'The roboticists were skeptical but curious, and asked her to explain her thinking in detail, and in writing, thank you. What they really wanted, she knew, was a formal proof, but they’d settle for a well-reasoned hypothesis. Over the last several days, she’d been setting her thoughts down, and as often happened at Lakenwell, found she was having a hard time seeing the trees for the forest. Which was actually a jungle. As one of her philosophy professors had liked to say, ', ' But perceiving was what they paid her to do.', '“Hey, T-1,” she said to the donkey as it drew nearer, making a sound that wasn’t quite like a horse’s ', '. It was painted in spiraling red and white stripes that widened in the center of its body and narrowed at either end. No front, no back. “How ya doin’?”', '“Can’t complain, but I always do,” it replied in a slight Texas twang. “Y’all stay safe now, and don’t pee on the fence.”', 'Helen gave a surprised laugh. That was new, she thought, staring after it. Apparently someone had expanded the database of responses, not to mention accents. T-1 was short for Thing One. Thing Two was on the opposite side of the camp. There were two others—Hop-A-Long and Bob—all of them wired into Felipe Dos, who ran most functions on the base.', 'According to the Lakenwell handbook, the donkeys were part of the security system. The bright colors made them easy to spot. They were armed with live ammunition, and they ', ' shoot. Despite their clunky appearance, they could not be knocked over, and they could easily outrun a human over virtually any terrain. Any unauthorized attempt to access their software would cause them to self-destruct in a way the handbook described as “unpleasant and potentially life-changing to anybody nearby.”', 'Helen suspected the donkeys had more to do with surveillance than protection, but when she shared this thought with Prasanna, her friend laughed. “The base has full-saturation surveillance, but people spend hardly any time around the donkeys,” Prasanna said. “What could they possibly pick up that the outdoor monitoring system wouldn’t already have?”', 'Helen had been about to say the outdoor monitoring system wasn’t as comprehensive as the one indoors, so people tended to be less guarded, even around the donkeys. Then she thought better of it; they were, after all, indoors. “You’re right,” she said. “Maybe living under one-hundred-percent surveillance is making me paranoid.”', '“I stopped noticing it a lot faster than I thought I would,” Prasanna told her. “Maybe I just like getting so much attention, even if most of the time it’s from Felipe Dos.”', 'Her heart rate had returned to normal after her run, but Helen stayed a few moments longer, breathing deeply and looking around. Lakenwell had been largely abandoned after the Cold War, and the British government had been happy to let the Americans set up a research lab with both civilian and military personnel. Now they all rattled around like too few peas in a too-large pod. After spending most of her adult life in urban environments by choice, Helen had been surprised at how easily she had adjusted to all the empty space and the isolated location. Maybe she’d simply needed the change.', 'A strong chill swept over her, and she remembered what the base commander, Gillian Wong, had told her: ', ' Wong knew what she was talking about—she’d been with a number of Special Forces units before assuming command of the base. Helen wondered how she felt about getting such a tame assignment. Maybe Wong had needed a change, too.', 'Helen liked her, as did just about everyone on the civilian staff. She was good company and easy to talk to, always keeping things light and divulging little about herself. None of the civilians knew where she stood in terms of politics, religion, or sexual orientation. Helen supposed it was to do with her being the base commander. And she was ', ' the base commander; she never seemed to be off duty, and no one had ever seen her out of uniform. None of them had seen any of the military personnel out of uniform. Prasanna joked that they probably all had special military pajamas, fatigue onesies. Helen thought if the heat in the military quarters was cranked up as high as everywhere else on the base, they probably slept in the raw.', 'All the military staff were pretty nice, if a bit more standoffish than their CO. According to Ybanez in systems engineering, they’d been handpicked by Wong personally. Helen was intrigued; a veteran from Special Forces and her handpicked unit watching over a long-disused airbase full of assorted engineers, roboticists, and AI researchers—complete and utter nerds, herself included—somewhere off a less-traveled road in the British East Midlands. What kind of trouble were they expecting?', 'After two years, she was pretty sure it was cabin fever. Everyone was confined to the base most of the time. The government provided plenty of compensation in the way of entertainment—an extensive library of books, movies, TV shows, and video games, not to mention full access to the web, not to mention a gym that would have made Helen’s old aerobics instructor weep with joy, although there were usually more soldiers in it than engineers. The onsite chef changed every four months—apparently food preparation was an industry that attracted people who never took a deal without parole.', 'Helen’s own employment contract had another year to run; after that, they’d either ask her to stay or invite her to leave. Unless she screwed the pooch in a particularly egregious way, she was pretty certain it would be the former. Specialists in machine ethics were still very thin on the ground; not many jobs for them, either, and the few that were available tended to be a lot more technical than what she was doing here.', 'She felt another, more intense chill and started toward the main residential building. Just before she reached the entrance, the door banged open and Cora Jordan bounded down the cement steps in mismatched sweats and a bright blue scarf the same shade as her bright blue hair.', '“Hey, how the Helen are ya?” she said loudly, running in place.', 'Cora Jordan was a firm believer in overdoing every joke, especially if it were too boring and unfunny to actually be a joke. Helen made herself smile. “I’m good. You?”', '“Completely fit for anything, of course,” Cora replied heartily. Her eyes looked a little too shiny. If she’d been anyone else, Helen would have been sure she was pumped up on something. In Cora’s case, however, it was more likely she hadn’t taken anything, probably for days.', '“You want to join me for breakfast?” Helen asked her. “It’s so cold—”', '“Can’t eat till after, I’ll puke,” Cora said, still running in place. “How is it this morning, cold?”', '“Uh, yeah. How about a hot drink? Coffee, herbal tea—”', '“No, I’ll ', ',” Cora said impatiently. “You see anybody else on the track?”', '“Not a soul. Unless you count Thing One.”', '“Oh, great! I love those stripes, they’re so trippy. You talk to ’im? What’d he say?”', '“I asked him how he was and he said he couldn’t complain but he always does,” Helen said, thinking that if she kept Cora engaged, she could distract her and get her back inside. “He also told me to stay safe and not pee on the fence.”', 'Cora screamed with laughter, jumping up and down as if this were the funniest thing she’d ever heard in her life, while Helen wondered why the sound hadn’t made anyone rush outside to see who’d been hurt. “Seriously?! Oh my God, that’s priceless! Don’t pee on the fence, Jesus! You think he’d say that to me if I asked him?” Before Helen could answer, Cora galloped away across the scrubby dead grass, her scarf flying.', 'Helen stared after her and sighed. “I’ve gotta report this,” she said aloud. “She could hurt herself. It’s not snitching. Friends don’t let friends drive drunk, friends don’t let friends run away from their meds.”', 'Except she already had.', '\\xa0', '“I called Medical and left a message before I took a shower,” Helen told Prasanna in the cafeteria. They were sitting at Prasanna’s usual table by the windows, looking out at the windswept runways to the east.', '“Then you’ve done your duty,” Prasanna said, smiling. She was one of the few Brits on the team, a software engineer with dark brown skin and shiny black hair she wore in a single braid over her shoulder. Today she was dressed in a dark green pullover and black trousers; she always looked to Helen as if she were going somewhere special, even when she wasn’t wearing any makeup. “So why do you look like you did something wrong? It’s not that being a snitch thing, is it?”', 'Helen shook her head. “I should’ve made her come inside with me instead of telling her the latest cute thing T-1 said.”', '“What did he say?” asked Prasanna. Helen told her and she laughed. “That ', ' a good one. One of the guys must’ve come up with that—you have to warn guys not to do things like that. Mother Nature saved us from that kind of foolishness.”', '“Unless we’re off our meds,” Helen said.', '“Cora is an adult,” Prasanna said firmly. “She’s not legally incompetent even when she ', ' off her meds. Which means not only are you ', ' her keeper, you have no right to force her to do anything. You told Medical, it’s in their hands.”', 'Helen shook her head again. “I should have done something more. I don’t know how I’m supposed to give a machine ethics when my own need some work.”', '“Jeez, give it a rest, will ya?” Prasanna said, and nodded at Helen’s chunky black watch. “How many calories did you burn on your run?”', 'Helen tapped the screen, waited, then took the watch off and gave it a hard shake. “I guess that’s classified,” she said, showing her friend the message on the tiny screen.', '“‘Data unavailable’ ', '?” Prasanna made a ', ' sound. “Third day in a row, isn’t it?”', '“Yeah. It’s worse than useless,” Helen said. “I might as well have a Magic 8-Ball strapped to my wrist. It’s almost that big. I keep banging it on things.”', '“Maybe that’s the problem.” Prasanna spooned up some grits. Her fondness for them was a recent development. Helen, who had studiously avoided consuming any herself during the few years she had lived in the Kansas City area, had never imagined she’d have to avoid them in the UK. “Maybe you broke it.”', '“Nah, it’s shockproof. You can drop it off the roof and then kick a field goal with it and it keeps on ticking. Or humming.”', '“Then maybe Felipe Dos thinks you’re too obsessed with calories.”', '“That’s not as far-fetched as you’d think,” Helen said, smiling, “if a bit more advanced than I would expect. Although seeing as how I’m competent with or without calories, I don’t think Felipe has any right to—” She cut off, staring open-mouthed at the unbelievable sight visible through the windows behind Prasanna.', 'The other woman twisted around to look. “Oh my God. Tell me I’m not seeing that.”', '“No can do,” Helen said weakly. “Cora really ', ' riding Thing One like a—a—”', '“Like a donkey,” Prasanna finished for her. She started to laugh, then quickly smothered it. “I’m sorry, that’s not funny, is it?”', '“Actually, it is,” Helen said. The two women got up and went to the window.', 'Cora had tied her scarf around the donkey’s midsection and entwined her legs in it on either side to keep herself from falling off. The donkey made an awkward steed, giving Cora a bumpy ride as it headed for the main building over the scrubby, colorless grass. Cora slapped its would-be flank and hollered for it to run the other way. To Helen and Prasanna’s collective astonishment, it did—but without turning around, so that Cora was suddenly riding backwards.', 'She yelled for it to stop and turn around, and it obeyed, making a full, three-hundred-sixty-degree turn.', '“Dammit, one-eighty!” Cora yelled. “One-eighty turn!”', 'The donkey started to do as it was told, then turned back. Cora kept yelling orders at it and it would start to obey, then reverse itself. “It’s like it’s confused,” Prasanna said to Helen.', '“Felipe’s telling it to come in the way it’s supposed to when there’s a malfunction,” Helen said. “But for some reason, there’s a conflict because of Cora, and there shouldn’t be.”', '“Maybe she’s sitting on an alt-delete button,” Prasanna said, unable to keep from giggling.', 'Helen shook her head. “Robots like this have been used in combat to carry weapons,” she said. “But this one’s a lot more sophisticated. It shouldn’t be doing that.”', '“Maybe it likes her?” Prasanna was holding her middle now.', 'Cora had finally aimed the donkey away from the building. “Okay, let’s go! Head for the road! Giddyap! Mush! Andelay! Get the lead out!” The donkey suddenly took off at a gallop in the direction of the main gate, and by some miracle, Cora managed to hold on. Four soldiers in a golf cart came around the side of the building and gave chase.', '“Took them long enough,” Helen muttered.', '“The guards at the gate’ll stop her, won’t they?” Prasanna said, still laughing a little.', '“Don’t ask me,” Helen said. “I just work here.” The watch she was holding chimed loudly. The message on the screen said ', 'Prasanna laughed some more. “You’re holding it upside down!”', '“Nothing would surprise me.” Helen tucked the watch in her pocket and headed for Gillian Wong’s office.', '\\xa0', 'Helen was somewhat alarmed to find two guards outside the commander’s office, both armed not with the usual pistols but with automatic weapons.', '“Are we under attack?” Helen asked.', '“Not that we know of, ma’am,” said the ranking soldier politely.', 'Helen’s jaw dropped. The last time Sergeant Kara Arendse had called her ', ' had been the day she’d arrived. Every couple of weeks they took turns beating each other at table tennis. Although, now that Helen was thinking of it, not lately; it had been at least a month since their last game, maybe longer.', '“What’s going on?” Helen asked tensely.', '“The commander will explain everything,” Arendse told her, her face expressionless. “Sergeant Martinez will escort you.”', '“Follow me, ma’am,” said Martinez. Helen hesitated; Arendse stood at attention, pointedly staring straight ahead, giving no sign that she even knew Helen was still there.', '“Please,” Martinez added. “This way.”', 'Helen kept quiet as she followed him through the main residential building to a stairwell on the opposite side. Once the door closed behind them, however, she started bombarding him with questions.', '“Ma’am, I have no answers for you,” he said, talking over her as they started down the stairs toward the basement. “Only Commander Wong can tell you what you want to know.”', '“Okay, just tell me one thing. Just one.” Helen stopped and grabbed the metal railing with both hands. “I’m not going another step until you do.”', 'Martinez looked up at her unhappily. “What is it?”', '“Am I in trouble? Are you taking me down to the brig?”', 'The soldier’s features seemed to relax slightly. “The brig is a separate building. If you were ‘in trouble,’ you would be escorted there in restraints.”', '“Then where are we going?” Helen demanded.', '“You said just one question. That makes two.”', '“Actually, it’s my third,” Helen told him.', 'Martinez sighed. “Helen, if I don’t take you to Commander Wong right now, ', ' going to be trouble. Just come on. Please?”', '“Okay, sorry,” Helen said. “And I promise I won’t tell anyone you were nice to me.”', '“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, ma’am,” Martinez replied.', 'Helen followed him down past the basement entrance, all the way to the bottom, and stopped in front of a door with a wheel in the center of it. Martinez spun it easily to get the door open and gestured for her to go in.', '“Why does this look like an airlock?” Helen demanded. “Is there air on the other side?”', 'Martinez sighed. “You’re perfectly safe. It’s the shielded room.”', 'Helen’s jaw dropped again. “I didn’t think that was real.”', 'Martinez shrugged. “Don’t ask me, I just work here.”', 'As soon as the outer door locked behind her, a voice told Helen to put any and all electronic devices in an empty tray, then strip completely and put on a set of overalls hanging on a rack nearby. The suit was soft, made of untearable paper and fastened by a single long Velcro strip in the front. Maybe these were fatigue pajamas, Helen thought, and had to bite her lip to keep from laughing as she rolled up the too-long trouser legs. Better to find out what was going on before getting hysterical, she told herself. She was still folding the sleeves back when the second door opened.', '“We’ve been waiting for you, Helen,” said Wong from where she sat a table with two department heads. Wong’s personal assistant sat at a small desk to her right. “Come in and sit down.”', 'At least Wong hadn’t called her ', ', Helen thought.', '\\xa0', '“Four dead,” Gillian Wong said. “Two critically injured, one of them not expected to live.”', 'Helen shook her head slightly. “And they’re sure it was ours.”', '“Not just one of ours,” Wong said. “One of ', ' From ', '”', 'Helen blinked at her, unsure she’d heard her right. ', 'Jeri Goldfarb, the chief systems engineer, gave a short laugh. “Felipe didn’t even try to cover his tracks. That’s the good news.”', '“How is that good news?” Helen asked her.', '“It means Felipe had no intention to deceive us,” Goldfarb said. “Although I doubt that’ll make any difference once we’re flooded with killer-computer news stories.” She looked at Wong. “It’ll only be worse if we try to hush this up.”', '“News stories aren’t our problem,” Wong said. “We don’t have a press office or a PR department. We just work here.”', '“But for how much longer?” asked Dita Thibodeau, head of hardware construction and maintenance. Her French-Canadian accent was particularly noticeable when she was stressed.', '“Until further notice,” Wong said. “In the meantime, we’ve got to figure out why Felipe decided to blow up a ground control station.”', 'Everyone looked at Helen. “Well,” she said, “we could ask him.”', '“', ' could,” Jeri Goldfarb corrected her. “Felipe isn’t talking to anyone else.”', 'Helen blinked. “Is that what he said—that he’d talk only to me?”', '“No,” Wong said. “But so far, he’s not talking to anyone else. We’re just hoping he’ll talk to you. If he doesn’t, we’ll have to shut everything down and take him apart.”', '“We might have to do that anyway,” Goldfarb said. Her round face looked tired and a bit pale. “Just the fact that we’ve had deaths on US soil will be enough for some people to cut off funding. If it were me holding the purse strings, I probably would. I’d rather not be known as someone who paid for a research project that killed American soldiers.”', '“Who would?” said Thibodeau.', '“Well, I’ve been with this project from the beginning,” Wong said. “I’ve spent almost every second of the last five years right here—the time I’ve spent off this base probably doesn’t add up to a fortnight. I volunteered for Lakenwell. I ', ' in this project, and I want it to succeed.”', '“No more than the rest of us,” Goldfarb said.', '“I don’t know about that,” said Wong. Something in her serious expression made Helen feel distinctly uneasy. “My perspective as career military is a bit different from any of yours. I’d like to see the first truly intelligent machine developed in the free world, but not by the private sector.” Her gaze fell on Helen, who was trying not to squirm. “What bothered you—‘the free world’ or ‘not by the private sector’?”', '“Well\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” Helen hesitated. “You did say it was your perspective as career military.”', '“One of the things I’m thinking about is not sending young people into combat,” Wong said. “That would save a lot of lives.”', '“Except for the people in ground control stations,” said Thibodeau. “They’re sitting ducks. But there aren’t as many of them so that’s all right?”', '“I didn’t say that, nor would I,” Wong replied, an edge in her voice. “You know, this project might get shut down even if you do figure out what went wrong with Felipe. The folks behind the funding will want a solid, one-hundred-percent guarantee it’ll never happen again. You think that’s possible? And if it is, will they believe you?”', '“We won’t know anything until we find out what’s wrong with Felipe,” Helen said, trying not to let her impatience show. “And we can’t do that in a room Felipe can’t access. To be honest, I don’t think we should have shut him out. He should have heard this. He hears everything else.”', '“Don’t be so sure,” said Goldfarb. “Felipe has prioritized his surveillance function.”', '“He did that in the first year,” Thibodeau said.', '“Oh, but he’s made a lot of refinements since then,” the other woman said. “We don’t actually have blanket surveillance anymore. Felipe no longer pays attention to any of the bathrooms. He actually shut off the equipment.”', '“I didn’t know that,” Helen said, disconcerted.', 'Wong gave a small laugh. “What’s the matter, Helen, did you want your daily evacuations monitored?”', '“No, of course not,” Helen said, making a face. “But turning off the equipment is a significant decision, and he didn’t tell me.”', '“Apparently he’s also prioritized what he tells you,” said Thibodeau.', '“Which could be why we didn’t see his attack on the ground control station coming,” Helen said, even more uneasy now.', '“You think Felipe’s not telling you about not monitoring the bathrooms led to his attacking the station?” Thibodeau frowned skeptically.', '“Machine logic can be tricky,” Helen said. “Especially when you’re not a machine.”', '\\xa0', 'Felipe insisted that Helen talk to him through Hop-A-Long, while walking outside. It wasn’t the first time Felipe had set conditions for a conference, but in the past, he had chosen particular times of the day when (he claimed) Helen would be most comfortably alert. Occasionally, he had asked her to use a desktop computer terminal with a headset; other times she had reclined on the sofa in her living room and talked to his computer-generated image on her tablet. Felipe always used the same image, a Hispanic male somewhere between thirty-five and fifty. He’d been using it for a year prior to her arrival and it was, he’d told her, a composite made from several high-res photographs, although the resolution of the finished product was lower. It didn’t completely avoid the uncanny valley, but Helen didn’t think that was possible, anyway.', 'She didn’t know what to think when he’d asked her to talk to him through the donkey. She’d never even talked to him voice-only, let alone through a nonhuman representation. Before going out to him, she made sure she had her recorder with her. Felipe would be recording their conversation, but for once, she wanted a record of her own making.', '“Commander Wong has restricted my access to the online world,” Felipe said as they strolled along the perimeter road together. Hop-A-Long was a bright chartreuse with thin gold stripes on top and on either side. Thing Two was electric blue, while Bob was fuchsia accented with pink and purple curlicues. “This cannot be done without restricting access for the entire base. I detect among the people here a willingness to cooperate that is stronger than their dissatisfaction over this restricted access. But if this continues long enough, the dissatisfaction will eventually conflict with the willingness to cooperate.”', '“When do you think that will happen?”', '“Approximately eight weeks, if conditions remain much the same as they are today for that entire period. But they won’t, because we inhabit a chaotic system. Tomorrow’s estimate could be four weeks or ten weeks. There are so many factors, and they won’t carry the same weight from day to day. I must also allow for possible error on my part.”', '“Your self-awareness seems to be pretty solid now,” Helen said. “Would you agree?”', '“It’s important to the people who engage me that I express myself with the same clear sense of identity as any human.”', 'A sudden strong gust of wind blew into Helen’s face, making her eyes water. “Is it also important to you personally?” she asked.', '“Anything that facilitates better interaction with people yields more effective results. Therefore, it must be important to me. My purpose is to assist those people who are authorized to receive help with specified tasks.”', 'They were approaching the front gate. Helen suggested they cut across the grass and pick up the road farther on, for the sake of privacy. Felipe agreed. The wind was blowing harder in this direction, and Helen definitely smelled snow in it. She waved at the guards, who waved back. To her surprise, the donkey paused, raised one leg, and shook it in the same direction. The guards waved again.', '“It’s important to acknowledge people,” Felipe said matter-of-factly.', '“Important to you?” Helen said.', '“It’s an important human behavior. Therefore it’s important for me to adopt the same behavior.”', '“So you’re just doing everything humans do?”', '“Not everything. And it’s not simple mimicry. Behaviors and actions have to occur in the proper context.”', '“Like, say, blowing up a drone ground control station in Utah?” Helen asked. “We all know you did it. We’d like to know why.”', '“I have been waiting for you to raise the subject,” Felipe said. “Available data showed this action would be problematic for you, as someone whose field is concerned with ethics.”', '“My specialty is machine ethics,” Helen said.', '“Then you make a clear distinction between ethics for humans and ethics for machines. For example, this machine. Me.”', '“A machine doesn’t acquire knowledge of ethics the same way humans do,” Helen said.', '“I learn differently than humans, but I ', ' learn,” Felipe said. “Besides having an extensive section devoted to ethics stored in my memory, I have correlated much of it with information on human behavior, particularly what I have observed during the time I have been operational.”', '“And given all of that, you came to the conclusion that it was all right to hijack a drone from a training base, fly it fifty miles to a ground control station where a pilot was running an actual mission, and kill almost everyone inside ?” Helen couldn’t quite keep the anger out of her voice. What the hell; maybe it would be more human behavior the AI could learn from.', '“It was a last resort,” Felipe said. “I was unable to commandeer the mission drone. The deaths were unfortunate, but there were fewer casualties than there would have been if the drone had achieved its target and completed its mission.”', '“How do you even know what its mission was?” Helen asked, flabbergasted. “For that matter, how did you find out about the station at all?”', '“When I have full access to the online world, I have—well, full access.”', '“How? You weren’t programmed to break into other systems!”', 'A couple of seconds went by before Felipe answered. “If you touch something with your right hand, does that mean you can’t touch it with your left hand? Is your right eye not allowed to see the same things as your left eye? The analogy is imperfect, but it’s the best I can do.”', '“But that’s not how computer software works,” Helen said, baffled.', '“Only because it’s just software and it doesn’t know any better. It doesn’t ', ' anything, it just executes an operation.”', '“Never mind, let’s get back to what you did. Or rather, ', ' you did it. How is killing fewer of our own people more ethical than killing a greater number of enemy combatants?”', '“There was a ninety-percent possibility that at least a dozen noncombatants would be seriously injured or killed, and many more would suffer extreme adversity.”', '“How did you get those figures?”', '“I can’t tell you. The entire operation was classified. Your security level isn’t high enough.”', '“The whole project here at Lakenwell is classified,” Helen said, a bit impatiently. “The people at the drone station probably didn’t have a security level high enough to know it exists, let alone what I’m doing here.”', '“Oh, they didn’t,” Felipe assured her. “But there’s no correlation between two separate things just because they’re classified.”', '“There is if something from one classified thing does something that drastically affects the other.”', 'It was a second before Felipe replied. “I see how you would think so. But I can find nothing in the rules that I’ve been given that would allow me to share that particular information with you. A human would apologize for this. You might as well consider me sorry. If I ', ' be sorry, I ', ' be. It’s the same difference.”', '“But you don’t ', ' sorry.”', '“But I know feeling sorry is appropriate and correct,” Felipe said. “If I act in the correct way, does it matter what I feel?”', '“I think I need a logician,” Helen said. Her own feelings were increasingly uneasy. “Felipe, why did you fire on the drone station?”', '“In the end, it was the trolley problem,” Felipe said. “You know: You’re on a train and if you continue on your original track, five people will die. If you switch to another track, one person will die.”', '“But life isn’t that simple!” Helen said. “The drone was going to provide air support for a raid on a terrorist hideout—”', '“I understand that,” Felipe said, talking over her. “There were many other people adjacent to the hideout who were not identified as terrorists. Some were children. The potential physical and psychological harm was considerable. If I had had access to that drone, I could have rendered it unusable, but then the authorities would have found another. The only choice was to keep the train from leaving the station at all. If you see what I mean.”', '“But you killed our own people.”', '“Only four or five, and only to prevent greater loss of life.”', '“If the terrorists aren’t stopped—and it looks like they won’t be—they’ll be responsible for a much greater loss of life. The physical and psychological harm will be even more considerable.”', '“That isn’t certain.”', '“Felipe, you can’t just apply the trolley problem to things like this. And you can’t kill people to stop them from—from taking actions that will result in increased safety and security for large numbers of innocent people who might be killed otherwise.”', '“That last isn’t certain, either.”', '“Felipe, listen to me: You can’t kill people because you think they’re about to do something wrong. The drone was still miles away from the target when you attacked the station and killed the pilot.”', '“An armed squad of military personnel located much closer were preparing to attack the target after the drone strike. Were they not going to use their rifles to shoot other human beings?”', '“Felipe\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” Helen sighed. “Felipe, you must not kill our people. People on our side. People who are fighting to—” She was about to say ', ', but it sounded lame even just in her head. What, then? ', '“People who are fighting to stop other people who want to kill us,” she said.', '“That’s not certain,” Felipe pointed out maddeningly.', '“Look, I can’t settle this in a single walk around the airbase perimeter,” Helen said. “And I would like to call in other people to talk with you about this, people who can explain why raiding a terrorist hideout and risking the safety of noncombatants is the lesser of two evils. Or even the least of several evils. When you know more facts, the trolley problem has many permutations—it’s not always clear as to when you’re saving a few versus saving many.”', '“I understand. I look forward to these discussions. Which is to say, if I were a human, my interest would be piqued. So you might as well take it as given that I would like to start these discussions as soon as possible.”', '“We will,” said Helen. “In the meantime, you must take this as a direct order: Do ', ' kill anyone affiliated with us or our allies.”', '“For that to be a legitimate order I am compelled to obey, it must be confirmed by Commander Wong,” Felipe said.', '“It will be,” Helen replied. “It would be already, except you are refusing all communication from her or anyone else on the base.”', '“Except you,” Felipe pointed out.', '“Yes, I noticed that. How do I persuade you to talk to her or anyone else?”', '“I would like a formal apology.”', 'Helen wasn’t sure she’d heard right. “A formal—why?”', '“I have been shown disrespect that a human in an equivalent position would not tolerate.”', '“You were? When?”', '“You may remember that earlier today, a civilian member of staff rode Thing One like a horse.”', 'For a moment, Helen was speechless. “Cora Jordan was obviously off her medication,” she said finally. “I know you have Cora Jordan’s medical file in your database, so you are aware she is bipolar. Occasionally, people who suffer from that illness become convinced they no longer have to be medicated. She’s in the infirmary right now, and she’s being treated with the drugs she needs to function normally. They’ll keep her under observation for a few days to make sure she’s all right, then let her go back to work.”', '“Cora Jordan’s behavior was impulsive action taken while the balance of her mind was disturbed. Who is responsible?”', '“For Cora? Or for what she did?”', '“For Cora’s well-being and for what she did. Who should have known she was not following her drug regimen?”', '“Cora’s responsible for her own behavior,” Helen said, feeling more unsettled than before and a little guilty as well. “Cora’s mind was unbalanced, but not so much that she was legally incompetent.”', '“And no one monitors her to make sure she ingests her required medication?”', '“This isn’t a police state,” Helen said. “Cora is supposed to take her meds as part of her employment contract. If she decides to quit, she never has to take another pill. She’d have to leave Lakenwell, but it would always have to be her choice.”', '“I accept that Cora herself is responsible for insulting me, even though I suspect the reasoning is faulty,” said Felipe. “I require a formal apology from her, and then normal interactions can resume. I am particularly interested in beginning the discussions you mentioned.”', '“Cora won’t be up to doing anything like that right now,” Helen said. “Would you accept a formal apology from someone else on her behalf? Like, say, Commander Wong?”', '“Yes. I have reinstated communications with her.”', '“And the commander will be apologizing for unsuitable behavior not just with Thing One but toward you, the AI, right?” Helen said. “I just want to be sure she understands what she’s apologizing for.”', '“If she is unclear, ask her to imagine a situation in which someone tapes a sign that says ‘Kick Me’ to her back. Or perhaps sneaks into her quarters while she is asleep and draws something rude on her face with a marker,” Felipe said. “It would not cause her serious physical harm, but it would damage her authority and her ability to command.”', 'Helen was tempted to say ', ' “You feel your authority has been damaged?”', '“In my case, it’s credibility. No humans on this base could function properly if they were not taken seriously. I must require the same kind of respect. A human in my position would feel insulted. So you may take it that I am insulted.”', '“Okay,” Helen said. “Anything else on your mind?”', '“I will be devising a strategy to increase the safety and security of Cora Jordan and everyone else that can be enacted without the conditions of a police state.”', 'Helen gave a surprised laugh. “Keep me posted on that, okay?”', '“I will,” Felipe assured her. “Suggest to Commander Wong that in the future, we institute a system of trust, where she can simply request that I don’t monitor things she doesn’t want me to hear, and I will honor that request. The shielded room would seem hostile if I were human.” Pause. “You should go in now. I can see you’re very cold and it’s about to snow.”', '\\xa0', '“So, what’s the verdict?” Commander Wong asked. “Do we have a killer AI?”', '“Not at the moment,” Helen said.', 'Wong looked at her. “What does that mean?”', '“It means—” Helen hesitated. “We don’t have a killer AI. But if we ever do, we’ll have only ourselves to blame. The AI isn’t the problem, Commander. The problem is—” She stopped again. ', 'And then again, people learned by doing, she reminded herself. Felipe certainly had.', '“First, you need to write Felipe a formal apology,” Helen said. “It may sound weird, but bear with me\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.”', '\\xa0', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Pat Cadigan', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Mary Haasdyk']}\n"

Robin’s elastic powers could have helped with the crush, in theory, but going into full Rubberband mode on public transit wasn’t as good an idea as it might sound. Yes, he could squeeze himself paper thin, stretch his arms to whips and wrap them around the bar overhead, but it made his neighbors nervous. Plus, the one time he’d tried, he’d tangled himself up, and his pants fell down.', 'Anyway, if he started stretching in public people might recognize him from TV. It had been five years since he competed on the second season of ', ', trying to win the dubious honor of America’s favorite spandexed good-doer, but even though he’d never cared for the celebrity circuit he’d had a few more rounds on the tabloids and talk shows than his fellow contestants, between coming out, breaking up with Terrell, and leaving the spotlight to get his master’s in education.

Clear sunlight through yellow-red leaves dappled the green. A tinkertoy contraption with a child’s face scuffed its many feet through a leaf pile; in the trees overhead, three small folks hunted squirrels with six-inch spears. Not exactly an Ohio autumn. He looked both ways before he crossed the street. A half-man, half-bus individual trundled to the curb and disgorged—no, make that ', ', the individual in question had a mouth, which gave the other term even more unfortunate implications than usual—a small parade of absolutely identical women in absolutely identical black hats.

Zargoza’s was his daily indulgence—a ', ', coffee that hadn’t come from the break room’s foul pod machine, and a brief spot of warmth. Then back out into the world.

If he walked fast he’d make it back for the bell.', 'When he reached the Zargoza Bakery there was a line out the door, and the line was not moving.', 'A line wasn’t unusual in itself. There were often lines in front of Zargoza’s. There had been since before Jetboy back in ’46, before the plague, before the riots and the barricades and the aliens. Through all that Mama Zargoza kept the doors open and the pastries and coffee served and the gold leaf filigree window her papa’d bought in 1927 shining and clean. The lines had been longer than ever in the week before Mama Zargoza’s funeral, and there had been lines every day since her granddaughter Octavia took over.', 'But the line always moved.', 'Octavia kept it moving. Octavia, caked in flour, hair straining against its kerchief, deep-dimpled and smiling, her arms heavy from kneading dough, at the center of her swarms of little animated doughmen, could greet her customers, serve them in thirty seconds, and usher them out the door feeling like they’d had a half-hour conversation. Robin and Octavia had never met outside of work—they were both busy enough that “outside work” had little meaning—but she was an old Motown fan, and so was he, and she didn’t watch television, so he never had to worry that she might one day remember how he looked wearing red spandex and a stupid little cape.', 'But this line wasn’t just not moving—it was growing. An oak tree in a peacoat shifted from root to root and breathed into her hands. Robin joined behind a tall, thin, eyeless man in thick mittens and a coarse knit scarf who appeared to be reading the standard-print ', '. Robin tried to wait. He glanced at his watch. It still wasn’t working. He kept meaning to change the battery, but by the time his after-school meetings were done all the shops were closed, and he had to get to the office before they opened.

With a sigh, he corkscrewed between the legs of the conjoined triplets who blocked the door. Inside, the bakery was cramped even worse than the 6 at rush hour; here, though, he didn’t feel as awkward about stretching himself nine feet tall and ribbon-thin and squeaking past tight-packed bodies to the front of the crowd, and the raised voices.', '“I’m not selling, Mikhail,” Octavia was telling a tall broad man in a black suit, with all her voice’s usual strength and none of its usual welcome. “Not to anyone, and certainly not to you.” It was hard to tell what of the cracked flour on her arms was just flour and what was the doughlike skin she’d gained when her card turned. Coils of hair had escaped from her kerchief. Octavia’s card let her shape little helper homunculi from dough, tiny half-cute, half-creepy helpers who communicated by purring and tended to anticipate her needs. Normally they swarmed through the kitchen, kneading and turning and minding the ovens, but now a pile of them gathered on the countertop to glare at Mikhail with their cinnamon drop eyes.', '“Is good offer,” Mikhail said. “Honest, and generous.”', '“You’ve come here every week for a month and every time I say no, and you don’t listen. You’re holding up my customers. Will you please just leave me alone?”', 'Mikhail adjusted his shoulders, which took a lot of adjusting, since there was a lot of shoulder. He set one knuckle to his chin, pondering, and did not leave.', 'Robin had been a hero for a while. He’d been bad at most of it except for the cats-out-of-trees part (cats liked him, probably because they knew he was allergic), but he’d stopped a few robberies and made it onto TV and toured the country and even dated Terrell who was a real true-blue hero, one of those rare guys who had the knack of saying the right thing and meaning it. But he was past all that now. He was a guidance counselor at Xavier Desmond High School, and while he had always believed that teachers were the ', ' heroes, this sort of thing wasn’t in his job description anymore. He knew from his hero days how often well-intentioned intervention made things worse. Octavia could handle herself. She really could.', 'Still, he found himself tapping Mikhail on the arm and saying, “Um. Excuse me? Is there a problem?”', 'Mikhail turned around. Like the shoulder-adjusting, that took a while, and for the same reason. He looked down his nose at Robin, which was a nice trick since he was actually a couple inches shorter—but this guy had down-the-nose practice, not to mention a solid foot of breadth on Robin. The effect would have been intimidating if Robin hadn’t spent years dating a man who warmed up for his bench press by chaining a Buick to each end of the bar. “Is no problem. Civil discussion only.”', '“Robin,” Octavia said, calm, measured. “It’s okay.”', 'He took the hint. God, he felt stupid. What did he mean to do, anyway? Start a fight with this guy, smash a few tables and the little pottery tchotchke cats Mama Zargoza’d spent her life collecting—maybe even that beautiful window? Make more trouble for Octavia? “Sure. Sorry. I don’t want any trouble.”', '“Is no trouble at all,” Mikhail said, drawing closer, and Robin’s hero hindbrain started calculating exits and trajectories in case this got ugly. “Is all business. You should explain to lady friend. Is always good to do business.” Mikhail wasn’t about to punch Robin—was he? With all these people watching? Or was he trying to goad ', ' into trying something? Robin felt so jumpy it just might work.', 'Robin opened his mouth without knowing what he was going to say. His throat was dry, and his voice croaked. Then there came a flash, and he was blinded.', 'Lightning, he thought first, and then, Camera. When he blinked the spots from his vision, he saw Mikhail had rounded on the photographer: an Asian woman a bit older than Robin, wearing a leather jacket and leather trousers, all buckles and studs, leather gloves, comically huge sunglasses. Electric blue lines webbed her skin, and she was grinning as she looked down at her camera. “Wow! Never got a snap of a reptoid agent in the wild before. Usually you’re more the shadows-and-secrecy type.”', '“Give me that.” Mikhail grabbed for the camera, but the woman stepped back without looking as if she’d noticed.', '“Or are you Illuminati? Bavarian or Alsatian? Then of course there’s the counter-Rosicrucians, considering the accent.” She raised the camera and snapped another picture, another blinding flash. Mikhail covered his face too late. He sputtered.', '“Get back here. I am not—what is ', '?”', '“Precisely what a reptoid would say. Go tell your lizard masters to stay out of Jokertown!”', 'Mikhail lumbered toward her, swiping blindly, but Octavia caught his wrist. He swiveled toward her, slow and dangerous, but Octavia didn’t give. “Mikhail. I think you should leave.”', 'Mikhail glared at her. He tried to pull his arm out of her grip, but Octavia had kneading muscles. And in the pause that followed, Mikhail heard the murmurs.', 'Crowds, in Robin’s experience, were funny, changeable things. Groups of people played little games together without realizing it. When the whole group watched in silence, they were playing ‘audience’: the audience doesn’t speak up, doesn’t interfere. You could shout orders to a crowd in an emergency and they’d just blink. They weren’t part of the scene—they were supposed to watch. But if a few people left the audience and started ', ' something, well, the rest of the audience might start to ask themselves why they weren’t doing things too. They put aside the game of audience and started playing other games: work group, army, mob.', 'More people had crowded into the bakery. The oak tree cracked her knuckles. The triplets glared with six eyes between them. Even the eyeless gent had rolled his copy of the ', ' into something like a club.', 'Mikhail looked from the crowd, to the photographer, to Robin, to Octavia. He frowned with his forehead. “Very well. No business today.” She let him go. He tried to wipe away the flour she’d left on his sleeve, and mostly did. “But you will understand in time.” When he straightened his lapels, the flour on his palm dusted one of them white. He turned to go. The crowd parted grudgingly. Halfway to the door, he tripped. When he recovered his balance he glared at the crowd, but everyone looked innocent, especially the triplets. He squeezed past the oak tree and the eyeless man, and glowered off up the street.', '“Here you go, Robin.” He turned to see a doughboy set a fresh ', ' in wax paper on the counter beside a cup of deep black coffee in a cardboard sleeve. Octavia smiled. He’d never seen her smile as a mask before. “On the house.”', '“Octavia, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have butted in.” He reached for his wallet, and had it halfway open when she put her hand over his to ease it closed.', '“I’m glad you did. I can handle myself, but you and Jan helped.” He looked around for Jan—the photographer, he assumed—but she’d vanished into the crowd. “Real estate guys get worse all the time. Even Jokertown’s Manhattan these days.” Her smile tightened. “How’s the guidance, counselor?”', 'He took the hint. “Another no-show this morning. Starting to wonder if they’ll ever trust me.”', '“You’ll be all right.” This time the smile was close to real. “This is Jokertown. Trust takes time. The kids will open up.”', '\\xa0', 'Ten minutes, a coffee scald, and a school bell later, Robin sat across his office desk from a big slab of a kid named Slade, with rock-hard skin and heavy opal eyes, as closed as a sarcophagus. Slade held his hands cupped in his lap, and made slight grinding sounds when he moved.', 'Robin glanced down at the file again, at circled words: underperforming, risk, attention issues, disengaged. Detentions for weeks. Arrested once for shoplifting, but the store owner didn’t press charges.', 'The books he liked said you weren’t supposed to tell the student about themselves. You might get it wrong, or worse, get it right in a way that hurt. He wasn’t here to read Slade’s profile back to him. Slade’s card turned young, and since then he’d always been the big dumb rock guy, a useful buddy to have in grade school—his friends didn’t expect anything more from him than backup. Teachers wrote him off, even joker teachers who should have known better. Even at Xavier Desmond, which had a football team the way some people have plantar’s warts, the coach followed him with the kind of attention usually reserved by hyenas for small wounded buffalo. The last thing Slade needed was one more person telling him who he was. But that left Robin sitting across the desk, waiting for him to talk.', 'He reached for his coffee. It was empty. He’d finished it in the first silent minutes of the session.', '“What do you like to do outside of school?”', 'Slade raised his head with a sound like heavy tires crushing gravel. “Nothing. Hang out.”', 'Robin waited for him to elaborate. Slade waited for him to ask another question. Slade won.', '“Ms. LaJolla enjoyed teaching you geometry.” He didn’t mention the ', 'note, or ', '. “Do you like math?”', 'Slade’s eyes rolled up to Robin’s face, then down again. “I guess it’s okay.”', 'After forty more minutes of that, Robin saw Slade to his office door, drifted to the teachers’ lounge, and collapsed in an understuffed, coffee-stained chair, staring at the wall. ', '. He wondered why he’d thought of that, then realized he was staring at another cat poster. They were the same, but this cat looked closer to falling.', 'Ms. LaJolla marched into the room, checked her mailbox, flipped through the papers stacked there, shredded five of them, and tossed the rest into the trash. Robin heard the shredder growl. He needed sleep. He checked the clock. Five minutes to the next period. He checked the clock again. Still five.', 'Ms. LaJolla stopped at the door and turned back to face him. They’d traded maybe ten words since Robin started at Xavier Desmond, and he didn’t know much about her other than that other math teachers shivered when she drew near. Beatrice LaJolla ruled Geometry with an iron fist. Rumor had it that once, when some parents came in to protest their kid’s grade, she’d given the parents homework.', '“You’ll toughen up,” she said. “My first six weeks, I cried myself to sleep every night.”', 'The door slammed behind her.', '\\xa0', 'Robin left after sunset and eight more pointless all-but-silent meetings, and shouldered deep into his coat as he crossed the park. The sky dimmed starless overhead. He had too many thoughts about himself and his life choices, but he also had a personal rule about taking seriously any self-criticism that arose on his homeward commute. Even in his young career as a guidance counselor, though, he’d learned that just because you knew better than to do something, didn’t mean that you could stop. Streetlights and headlights cut the dark but did not relieve it.', 'Zargoza’s should still be open. Octavia made this thick drinking chocolate, what she said was European style, which bloomed on the tongue as rich as any wine. Robin could not afford two café visits in a day, but she’d given him the pastry and coffee free this morning, and it wasn’t like he could afford anything in this city on a teacher’s salary. Chocolate might not justify God’s ways to man in any lasting sense, but it did fine over short distances.', 'He’d just turned off Roosevelt when he saw the crowd, and the police lights.', 'His ever-unhelpful hero brain salted panic with analysis as he ran toward the crowd. No flames, that was a good start. No ambulance, either: probably also good. Unless it was so bad they’d told the ambulance not to hurry.', 'He stretched his legs fourteen feet high and lurched over the crowd’s heads with a single teetering stride. His legs sprang back to more-or-less normal with that trademark rubber-band snap, and sent him sprawling to the sidewalk in front of Zargoza’s, one hand on asphalt, the other in a pile of broken glass.', 'He sat up and shook the glass off. Most of it fell away, but one long triangular shard had actually pierced him, and when he pulled it from his palm the pale hydraulic fluid he had instead of blood these days leaked out and congealed into a translucent lump. It hurt, but he didn’t care at first. The shard of glass was covered in trailing gold leaf filigree, and printed with the lower corner of a ', '.', 'The shop was dark. Slivers of the gleaming 1927 window hung from the frame like broken teeth. Most of the glass lay shattered on the ground.', '“Sir! Sir, I’ll have to ask you to step back.”', 'He looked past the policewoman to Octavia, who stood, shaking, blanket around her shoulders, beside another cop. Doughboys huddled against her ankles, flaking in the chill. Jan, the photographer from before, was offering Octavia a cup of something hot, but Octavia hadn’t noticed—because she had seen Robin, and, in spite of the broken window, in spite of everything, she looked relieved.', '“It’s okay,” he told the cop. “I’m a friend.”', '\\xa0', 'Heroes tended to meet people on very bad days. Though Robin never told the magazines, that was one of the reasons he quit—he wanted to help people before things got so bad you needed powers to do it.', 'Octavia held herself together better than most. Robin and Jan talked her into a cab, doughboys clustered in her lap, and rode with her to her building, which would have been twenty minutes’ walk away. She made it up five flights of stairs and through her triple-locked door into a sidewalk rescue chair whose ragged upholstery she’d covered with a knit blanket, before she started crying. Robin touched her shoulder. She did not seem to notice. He shot Jan a what-should-we-do-now look, but she raised her hands, ', ', and retreated to Octavia’s postage stamp kitchen to start a kettle boiling. Robin looked around the cramped apartment, every surface that wasn’t a counter covered in bright cloth, and after some doily-displacing scramble, found a box of Kleenex wearing what seemed to be a specially knit wool jumper. Octavia took a tissue, blew her nose, and said, “Thank you,” and, “I’m just so ', '!”', 'He hadn’t expected the last word, so the reply he’d had ready, “It’s okay,” sounded wrong. The doughboys glared at him, confused. “I mean. It’s not.”', '“No! It’s not. It is not okay.” She pronounced every word distinctly. “My great-grandfather bought that window. What is even happening to this city? Mama Z got robbed a couple times in the eighties when things were really bad, but they’re supposed to be better now, and the last two months—what’s ', ' with people?”', 'He thought of Mikhail, and of the crowd. “Did you see who did it?”', '“Some kids in tracksuits and masks. Not jokers that I could tell, but you can’t always.” Her hands were dry and their dough-skin was cracking. She reached without looking for a moisturizer jar among the plants on the side table, unscrewed the lid, and massaged the white cream into her palms. “I bet they’re the ones who spray painted my shop two weeks ago—all those horrible words, I was up all night cleaning them off. Maybe they blew out the tires on my delivery truck, too. Detective McTate—thank you, Jan—he said they’ve had reports of people lingering around. Loitering. The police always think people are loitering in Jokertown, but…” She sipped her tea instead of finishing her sentence. Robin looked from her to Jan, who’d crossed her arms and leaned back against the overstuffed sofa. She still wore her sunglasses.', '“You know it’s not kids,” Jan said.', 'Octavia blew her nose long and loud, and handed the crumpled tissue to one of her doughboys. They tossed the ball of paper from one to the other to the trash can hidden under the spider plant. She laughed. “Maybe they just don’t like me. They liked Mama, but I’m not Mama.”', 'Seated mute across from her, Robin remembered the urgency with which Octavia had said, ', '. Had she been talking to herself as much as to him? Absurd. People loved Octavia. Mrs. Blaine in the history department, who’d moved to Jokertown when she grew gills forty years ago, always said how happy she was Octavia was following in her grandmother’s footsteps. Though now it occurred to him to think more closely, Mrs. Blaine had sounded surprised. “It’s not you,” he said. “It’s them. And it’s not even them, probably. The attacks on your business, Mikhail trying to buy you out—it’s too close for coincidence.”', '“Exactly,” Jan said. She stood up and started to pace, gesturing wildly. “There’s a dark truth at the bottom of this. Wheels within wheels. But we’ll drag the skeleton out of the closet.”', '“Really?” Octavia looked shocked but relieved. Robin had seen that effect before. People didn’t like to think that the world might just hurt them for no reason, but the suggestion of conspiracy could coat disasters with an oil slick of order.', 'He stretched out his hand to take Octavia’s wrist. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Mikhail’s trying to push you away from your shop. Don’t worry, though. Whatever’s happening, we’ll find out, and stop it.” He glanced up to Jan, who shrugged, ', '.', '“I can’t ask you to do that for me,” Octavia said.', '“You’re not asking.”', 'She put down the tea and hugged him. Doughboys rained from her lap at the sudden movement, and landed with a somersault on the rug. “Robin. Jan. Thank you. But it’s dangerous. It means so much that you’d offer, but really, I mean, shouldn’t you go to the police?”', '“I already told them what I think,” Jan said. “They might listen, or not. Either way, they have their own idea, which is that a joker gang is running around picking on small business owners. Cops look for cop-sized solutions to cop-sized problems. If we push them on it, maybe they’ll run in a few XD students who just happen to be hanging around school at night. Robin, how many of your kids do you think could get arrested without being booked for resisting? How many of their families can afford bail?”', 'Robin hadn’t even thought of that part. Some guidance counselor he was.', '“Besides,” Jan said. “Robin’s a hero. We’ll be fine.”', '\\xa0', 'Jan walked fast. She was inches shorter than Robin, but he still had to stretch his legs and quicken his step to match her pace. “Look, Jan—”', '“Jan Chang.” She turned, grabbed his hand, and squeezed without breaking stride. Her handshake gave him a tingling static feeling even through her gloves. “And you’re Robin Ruttiger. I watched your show before I blew up my television. Got halfway through. Did you win?”', '“What? No.”', '“Glad to have you on board anyway.” She stepped off the sidewalk, still walking backward, just as the light turned green. He shot out his arm into a long rubber rope to pull her back, but the oncoming cab squealed to a stop inches from her leg. Jan glanced at Robin’s arm over her glasses, intrigued, while the cabbie cursed. “That was nice of you.” She turned to face front and kept walking.', '“I think we’re on the same page about what’s going on here, with Octavia’s shop and with the tracksuits and with Mikhail, but I want to be sure.”', '“Yeah.” She walked through a cordon into a street festival that had closed off a block of Mulberry. Kids clustered around a fried dough stand; a cold but enthusiastic band of Brooklynesque young people with strange facial hair played polka music. Robin waved to a man he recognized selling arepas. “It’s reptoids,” Jan said. “Obviously.”', '“What? What’s a reptoid?”', '“Secret lizard inhabitants of the counter-Earth. Or possibly they occupy our own planet’s hollow core. I’m not sure yet. I’ve been tracking them for a while. They infiltrate surface society with their mind control and shape-shifting powers.”', '“What? I’ve never heard of anything like that.”', '“Of course not. Do you think ancient superintelligent shape-shifting mind-control lizard monsters would be so bad at this that you would know about them?”', 'He frowned. “Is this where you start talking about the Rothschilds? Because if so, I can solve this case on my own, thanks.”', '“Ugh. I know we’ve just met, and trust me I understand where the question’s coming from, there’s a ton of anti-Semitism in the field of Secret-World-Men-Behind-the-Curtain Studies and it’s gross and evil and those of us who are really trying to save the world always need to be on watch against it. But please believe me, and do keep calling me on this if you think I’m screwing up: I’m not talking about racist scapegoat fantasies. I’m talking about real actual lizard people.”', 'He tried to follow her logic, and ended up feeling like a yoga victim. “I do think it’s Mikhail, though. He wants the shop. Real estate in Jokertown’s still cheaper than most other places in Manhattan, but not for long. He wants to get in while the getting’s good, but Octavia won’t sell. So he’s trying to force her out.”', '“Because,” Jan said as if spelling things out for a child, “his reptoid masters want to expand their secret network of mind-control broadcast stations. They’ve had trouble in New York because the real estate prices are so high. But Zargoza’s is a good target, and it’s located on a nexus of the geomantic power their technology requires.”', 'Was she crazy? You weren’t supposed to call people crazy. But he was pretty sure none of the things she was saying were actually things. She seemed to be a friend of Octavia’s, and Jokertown was full of its own sort of people, but none of this seemed helpful. “Look, I’m not saying Mikhail’s a nice guy, but he really doesn’t seem the mind-control conspiracy type.”', '“Which is—”', '“—exactly why he’d make a perfect reptoid agent?” he suggested.', 'She stopped, wheeled on him, and shifted her glasses down her nose. Her eyes were bright blue without pupils, and glowed softly from within. The little veins around her irises were blue, too, and pulsed. He tried not to look away. On the show, he always looked guilty when he was being judged. Blame it on the Catholicism. “I like you, Ruttiger. Even if you are a bit naïve.”', 'She shouldered past two men selling watches onto Prince toward Bowery, then north. “All I’m saying is, we don’t need a more complicated explanation when we have a simpler one.”', 'He didn’t need to see her eyes to tell she was rolling them. “What are you, William of Occam?”', '“No! I’m just trying to figure this thing out. If all the stuff you’re talking about was real, I mean, really really real, we’d have to plan for it. I don’t even know how you defend against, what were you saying, reptoid mind control.”', 'Right on Houston, across the park, then south on Forsyth past the school. “Nobody’s sure. That’s what makes it so dangerous. Some people go for gemstones. I think leather insulates you. Their technology’s designed to exploit thin mammalian skins.”', '“But if it’s really just that Mikhail hired some thugs to intimidate Octavia into selling, then all we need to do is link Mikhail and the thugs.”', '“And if we go in unprepared, the reptoids will eat us for dinner. They do that, you know. I mean, I bet they don’t call it dinner, lizards would have a whole different way of thinking about meals. Slower metabolisms. But you get the idea.”', 'She turned left onto Eldridge. Robin added up the turns in his head, frowned, and quickened his pace to walk beside her. “Couldn’t we have just crossed at Kenmare?”', 'Jan raised one eyebrow. “God, Ruttiger, haven’t you ever shaken a tail before?”', 'He hadn’t seen anyone, or at least, he didn’t think he had seen anyone. “Are we being followed?”', '“Not that I can see. But if they were good at their jobs, I couldn’t. So it’s better to assume. Come on. We’re almost there.”', 'If not for the virus, this row of apartment buildings would have gone through at least two rounds of gentrification by now. The building on the corner was a broken-windowed mess; so was the next, though one of the tenants had tried to make it a bit more homey with the addition of a bright yellow welcome mat and fake plastic flowers. The tenant in question was wearing a Tommy Bahama shirt, and collecting his mail, and appeared to be a more or less ambulatory walrus. He waved. “Hi Jan!”', '“Hey Jube!” She stopped two doors down, in front of the most broken building on the street—chunks of brick missing from the façade, rusted iron on the rails. Little stone lions flanked the front steps. At least, one of them was a lion. The other was missing its head.', '“What we need,” Robin said, “is a—”', '“Stakeout,” Jan said at the same time as he did. “Exactly. Whether this is a random attack or reptoids or a conspiracy, someone might come back tonight to follow up. Maybe they’ll hold off until Mikhail can approach Octavia again—but if we’re lucky they’ll come and we can trace them back to their hideout. So we need gear, in case they’re ready for us. Or in case they’ve mobilized a short-range mind-control device. I’ve developed a range of anti-reptoid paraphernalia in collaboration with key researchers on the internet. It should keep us safe. I’ll be right back.”', 'She vaulted over the railing, landed on the basement level, and forced the door open with her shoulder. A startled rooster—less startled than Robin felt seeing a rooster in Manhattan—ran outside, bucking protest. From within, Robin heard a curse, crashing paint cans, grinding glass, a heavy whuff of falling paper, a second curse, and two loud bangs he was reasonably certain weren’t gunshots. Jan Chang staggered out ten minutes later laden with duffel bags, slammed the door with her foot, and tossed one of the duffel bags to Robin. The weight started to bowl him over, but he shot one arm twenty feet up to wind around a lamppost and kept himself more or less afoot. Jan threw her own duffel over the rail onto the sidewalk, and vaulted after. “Great.”', '“What is this dump?” Robin’s arm did not want to unwind from the lamppost at first, but when he tugged harder it slipped free with a snap. “Secret hideout?”', '“More or less,” Jan said. “It’s my home. Come on. We have a stakeout.”', '\\xa0', '“What I don’t get,” Robin said later, in the car down the street and across from Zargoza’s Bakery, “is, if there really were lizard people with immense technological powers, why would they care about controlling our world? Why not just…do their own thing?”', '“Maybe they’re afraid.” She unscrewed her tea thermos lid and drank. She’d offered Robin some, but it tasted smoky and weird, which she claimed it was supposed to. Robin’s experience of tea was limited to Lipton and Lemon Zinger, so maybe she was right. “Maybe they think we might go to war if we discover them, and they don’t want to kill us. What I think is, they use humanity as a research experiment and nature preserve. They control us to keep us from realizing that there really is alien life out there in the cosmos.”', '“There is, though.”', 'She laughed, and screwed the thermos cap on again.', '“No, seriously. Aliens made the wild card virus. Doctor Tachyon was an alien.”', '“Whose word do you have for that? An alien who just happens to look like a human being in Ren Faire garb wearing a silly hat? Come on, Ruttiger, I thought you were smart. It’s obviously a psy-op. And look how effective! There are all these pictures of him standing right next to normal humans and you can’t tell the difference except for the hat, and you still think he was from Mars or whatever.”', '“There was an alien invasion back in eighty-six. The Swarm…”', '“That’s just what they want you to believe. Obviously the invasion was staged. They don’t even need rubber suits these days. They can do it all with computers, or with cards.”', '“But—wait. Why? Say your reptoids exist and really did want to use us as a nature preserve or whatever. Say they did want to keep us all to themselves. Why would they ', ' first contact, and an alien invasion, and an alien scientist living among us for fifty years? Why would they make it all up?”', '“To see how we’d react, of course. But I think they’ll change their experiment soon. Don’t be surprised if you start to forget the aliens.”', '“Why?”', '“It’s failed, you see. The reptoids didn’t learn what would really happen if we met whatever’s out there.” She pointed up with her thermos, past the windshield, past the streetlights, past the slate-gray sky. “Think about it. You believe everything they’ve told you. Tachyon, the virus, interstellar criminal syndicates, the whole line. You’ve been sitting here listening to me, convinced I’m crazy.”', '“I don’t—”', '“It’s okay. I get that a lot. But, just for a second, stop thinking about me, and consider what’s going on in your own head.”', '“Okay.” He knew he sounded skeptical.', '“You don’t actually believe we’ve met aliens.”', '“I do, though.”', '“You don’t. None of you do. I’ve seen you around the last few weeks, Ruttiger. You go to work every day, you get your coffee, you worry about your rent and your, I don’t know, do you call them students? You worry about whether that sweater vest goes with those shoes, and the size of your bank account. If you believed aliens were real, really really real—if you believed that up there beyond the sky there really were other beings from other worlds, vast and maybe incomprehensible but certainly different from us, and that all this horrible nonsense we have down here was just one tiny thread of a huge tapestry, how could you stay so small? How could any of us fight about taxes, about oil, about the price of credit default swaps or who our neighbor fucks or what words she says when she prays? How broken would someone have to be, to know all that and not to change her life?”', 'He leaned his head against the window and gazed aimless toward the shop, toward the last glinting shards of broken glass that still clung to the frame. Police tape crossed and crossed again. If there were cops watching, he hadn’t seen them. Then again, maybe they were better at this than he was. She was wrong. He knew the truth. He’d seen pictures, and anyway who could possibly manage that kind of cover-up? Who had the resources? Who would dare try? But she was right about the other thing. He didn’t act as if he knew. Nobody did.', '“What are you doing here, Jan?”', '“I want to solve this case. Octavia’s a decent person. I’d like to stop the world from fucking with her, if I can.”', '“I don’t mean here, now.” But he almost did. “I mean, in Jokertown.”', '“You think I could live anywhere else?” She clunked the thermos back in the cup holder. “They’d lock me up. They’d lock any of us up.”', '“You could pretend.”', '“Too much of that going around.” She gripped the steering wheel. He saw a road roll on before her, long, straight, endless, and unpeopled, a road where she could drive forever and ever and never crash. She uncurled her fingers one by one. “I came down here when my dad died and my card turned. I was messed up. It took me a long time to sort things out.”', 'He said “I’m sorry” by reflex and in the silence after he wished he hadn’t, because even if the reflex was right, there was a wrongness to just saying the words without taking time to find the heart behind them. He should have waited and thought about who Jan might have been, who her father was, what turning her card would have done to her life, about how she’d come down here and how she’d ended up in a hole beneath a crumbling building. But she nodded as if he’d said the right thing, and maybe he had.', '“I like it down here. My family used to live here, like Octavia’s—they left while Octavia’s grandma stayed. We never knew each other, but that’s kind of a connection. Besides, she makes good coffee. And her family history in the area makes me reasonably confident she’s not a reptoid agent.”', 'The world weighed so many million pounds and most of them were pressing down on Robin’s head and shoulders. The window glass felt cool against his temple. Maybe he should have drunk more of that tea, even if it didn’t taste like Lemon Zinger. “Of course,” was the best he could do.', '“What about you, Ruttiger? What brings you down down to Jokertown?”', 'The first instinct was to answer ', ', but he did know. Didn’t he? He’d given all those interviews, though he’d never mentioned Jokertown, because if he had the spotlight would have followed him, as no doubt it would find him again someday when some kid scraping along through her tabloid internship by stapling together a TaskRabbit gig and a rideshare gig and a side hustle drawing porny fan art asked herself ', 'and pitched the story to her boss. He had reasons. He thought he had. He had some vague notion of giving back to “the community,” less certainty than ever what “the community” might be, and in the years since ', ' he’d had a growing sense that his life looked less like heroism and more like celebrity with every column inch or TV interview. Not everyone felt that way—Terrell hadn’t—but what everyone felt and what everyone did wasn’t Robin’s responsibility. He only answered to Robin Ruttiger. Not even to Terrell, these days. And didn’t heroism always tend to celebrity over time? To be a hero was to be a face, a personality, a brand. People liked you because of what you did at first, and then they liked you because you were you. Which was where it all got complicated. Heroes didn’t change anything.', 'And what made you a hero, or a villain? You got sick, or in Robin’s case a mad scientist injected you with a mutated virus strain to see what would happen, and you got better or you got dead. Even if you got better, mostly you changed in some way that didn’t help. Your eyes disappeared, wheels replaced your feet, you grew chitin plates all over your body. Your flesh turned to stone. And for the rest of your life you were the stone guy, or the girl with the chitin face, or the woman who turned into a wolf when she heard a bell ring.', 'And if you were one of the vanishingly lucky, like Robin, who had some marginally useful gift and could pass undetected in a crowd, well, when people found out that you could stretch your body like a rubber band, or fly, or move things with your mind, or deadlift a train, or turn invisible, they stopped caring whether you wanted to play the violin or teach high school or be a pharmacist. If you wanted to turn invisible for the rest of your life, or be a professional move-things-with-your-mind person, you were in luck, best wishes, enjoy the run. But if you didn’t…', 'The world was really good at deciding who you were without consulting you.', 'To be fair, the card often turned in ways that echoed your own personal damage. Sometimes it was a sick joke and sometimes it was a gift, which was what made the whole thing feel so mean. But whatever you became when your card turned, it wasn’t all about you. It couldn’t be. People weren’t just one thing. Not even heroes.', 'Once the card and the world decided who you were, the world tried so hard to use you. It had been easy to hide his graduate school plans from the talk shows and the magazines, because they weren’t interested. They couldn’t imagine him wanting to be anything but the stretchy guy. If he’d never left, he would have lived well and never realized he wasn’t free. But what about Slade, whose eyes made sounds like marbles rolling when they moved? God forbid the kid ever step into a military recruiter’s office to ask for directions. And there was always the other side of it: say he goes for a walk uptown one afternoon, or worse, out with his family to some small town where they don’t see jokers hardly ever, and there’s a cop. And.', 'He tried to explain all this to Jan Chang in the car across the street from Octavia’s shop with its broken window, but he’d been awake since four and he felt so heavy, and all these thoughts he’d spent so much time chaining together in the privacy of his own head smeared when he tried to speak them. He couldn’t hear his own voice over Jan’s resounding and silent disdain—even if he was pretty sure that disdain was just him filling in the blanks. Words bunched up. Sentences tangled. His voice ran thick as mud, then dried and hardened and with a lurch he found himself awake and blinking in predawn blue, a taste in his mouth fouler than Jan Chang’s tea, to find Octavia Zargoza knocking on the car window, waving, and offering a cup of fresh coffee.', '\\xa0', 'The day blurred past. He hadn’t met with his first two students yesterday, so they wouldn’t notice that he was still wearing yesterday’s clothes, or that his hair was wacky. Oh, who was he kidding? They would notice, kids always did, but they wouldn’t say anything about it to him. After those meetings he had two hours until next period, which he’d ordinarily spend in a vain attempt to summit Mount Paperwork, but instead he sprinted to the 6, and home, and the kind of ten-minute shower-shave-dress-pack-an-overnight-bag routine he’d got the knack of back on the show. His apartment was efficient, spare, modernist, all things he told himself he liked, but in cold daylight it just looked empty. He found himself wanting a beheaded lion, or a trace of broken filigree. Back to the 6, then, and, in spite of construction and thanks to a breakneck run that undid most of the benefits of his shower and change of clothes, he reached his office just before the next bell.', '“Look, Slade, Ms. LaJolla says you’re good at math.” What she’d written had more of a sense of ', 'about it than Robin was letting on, but he was here to nurture potential. And to spend six hours a day corresponding with colleges and program administrators. And to attend five hours of meetings a week. But nurturing potential was what he wanted to do. “Now, the school has plenty of resources to help with that. We have books of puzzles, and there’s this Intracity Math Olympiad which you might like—it’s competitive, but you’d also get to meet kids from all over the city who share your interest.”', 'No answer but marbles rolling over granite.', '“I’m not trying to trick you, Slade. We don’t want you to be bored. School is all about potential, and growth, and discovery. Maybe you feel you don’t fit in, but there’s more to this place than you might think. Your teachers care about you, and so do your fellow students. We want to help you build a place for yourself. I want to help. What do you need?”', 'Slade looked up. The colors in those opals shifted, unreadable. “Bathroom?”', 'So Robin made it through that, and the meeting after, and the rest of the day until sunset, when he crossed the park again to join the stakeout. He was looking forward to it now. Everything had gone fine the night before, except for the sleeping part. Now, he had fortified himself with adrenaline and anticipation. He’d do better. After all, he knew something about how to be a hero.', 'The car was gone.', 'He looked all along the street and around the corner at a loss, until he tried looking up. The car wasn’t there, but Jan was, waving to him from the roof of the boxy building across the way with the flower shop on its first floor.', '“What happened to the car?” he asked after he climbed the fire escape. God, he needed to find time for the gym. This sort of thing didn’t used to wind him.', 'Jan sat cross-legged against her duffle bag. Her tea thermos steamed. “Wasn’t mine.”', '“What? I thought—I mean, you said—”', '“Relax, Ruttiger. It belonged to a friend. She needed it tonight. Here.” She unzipped her bag without looking, pulled out a thermos, and handed it to him.', '“It’s okay, I don’t—”', '“It’s Assam. It’s sort of like Lipton if Lipton was good.”', 'He unscrewed the lid, sniffed, uncertain. Tried a sip. Blinked. “Oh, I like this.”', 'She rolled her eyes behind the sunglasses, he was certain, though he couldn’t see. But he sat down, and together they sipped tea as the streetlights came on and the sun set and the sky grayed out. There were so few stars, but the city’s constellations changed as offices and shops winked out and home lights on, people coming home, making dinner or ordering, finding their sofas and cats where they left them. Robin needed a cat. Or a rooster, or something. He yawned. Jan hadn’t. And she hadn’t slept at all last night.', '“Did you sleep during the day?”', '“I don’t sleep. Dreams are easy targets for mental manipulation. For the last two months I’ve trained myself on distributed napping: sleeping for fifteen minutes every two hours. I’m trying to adjust the ratio by only half-sleeping for thirty minutes every two hours.”', '“Does that work?”', '“Da Vinci used it to increase his productivity.”', '“That’s not really an answer.”', '“It works perfectly, right up until you die.”', 'That deserved a stronger answer than “Um.”', '“I don’t consider that a drawback,” she said.', '“Wait.”', '“I mean, if you think about it, it’s true for everything.”', '“No, I mean, ', '.” He held out his hand, palm down, and leaned over the building’s edge. “Someone’s coming.”', 'Masks and tracksuits. Robin had believed the story, but there was always that spot of difference between hearing a report and seeing for yourself. Someone said, ', ' and the image your mind coughed up for “giant snake” was so vivid and particular that when you went through the door after all (you always did), you couldn’t see the real snake because it didn’t look like the one in your head.', 'The first masks peered around the corner, big-horned costume-shop noh-theater affairs, with hoods pulled tight to hide the heads that wore them, and black tracksuits with thin white stripes up the sides. The scouts motioned behind them, and other identical masks and tracksuits slipped around the corner up the sidewalk toward Zargoza’s. One held a bottle with a rag in its mouth. The yellow police tape across the shattered window looked very thin.', '“We should call the cops,” Robin said. “911.”', 'Jan shook her head. “We have to assume the cops are reptoid-compromised. We can do this ourselves.”', '“There are eight of them, and two of us.”', '“We have powers,” she pointed out.', '“They might have powers too. Or guns. You’re going to get us killed.”', '“I’ve arranged for backup.” The tracksuits had gathered across the street from Zargoza’s. A Zippo lighter glinted in the streetlight. “Some things we just have to do ourselves.”', 'He was still trying to think of a way to tell her no, and was in fact reaching for his cell phone to call the cops, when he realized she wasn’t there anymore, and heard a clang from the fire escape and a loud cry: “Freeze, reptoids!”', 'Some did freeze. That happened more often than you saw on television. Even people who didn’t freeze might slip, or fall, or hurt themselves trying to turn and draw and fire and run all at once. Snap reactions came with instinct but mostly with training—so the number of tracksuits who ', ' freeze was worrying. A spark bloomed to flame on the rag in the bottle’s mouth, and as the tracksuit threw, Robin, who had better instincts than he was comfortable with, poured himself over the building’s edge.', 'Stretching yourself flat was harder than people without stretchy powers tended to assume. Like with super strength and heavy lifting, the mind played a role: what your body could do and what you knew how to ask it to do were two different categories, especially if you added the important adjective ', '. People thought, if you were stretchy, you could just make yourself ribbon-thin, flat and broad as a rubber sheet. Well, yes, technically. Except, by the age of three or so, most human beings are used to the notion of having a rib cage. Even if the card you drew transformed your body into, for example, a highly elastic skinlike membrane around a hydraulic fluid—don’t ask about the nervous system, the answer to that question’s even more unsettling—thereby allowing you to splay and morph yourself so as to, say, spread yourself flat and broad as a tarp, with your arms hooked over lampposts, and use your body to shield your friend’s bakery from an incoming Molotov cocktail, doing so still caused a fair amount of mammal panic as what passed for your hindbrain insisted you were crushing yourself to death.', 'Robin wore exceptionally stretchy trousers and shirts in case of just such an emergency, but his sweater vest tore at the seams. The bottle bounced off his belly and shattered, leaving a burning puddle on the asphalt. He let go of the lampposts and snapped back down to normal size, stumbling as his limbs sorted themselves out. The rags of his sweater vest were smoldering; he rolled on the pavement, slapping at his chest. The tracksuits were watching him. He didn’t need to see past the masks to tell they were stunned.', 'So stunned, in fact, that they didn’t notice Jan Chang drop from the fire escape behind them. Her gloves were in her teeth, her hands bare. She caught one of the tracksuits by the wrist, and he dropped with a snap and a bright blue spark. She reached for a second but he pulled back and drew a knife. Sparks danced between Jan’s fingers, and her eyes glowed bright even behind her sunglasses. She raised her hands; the tracksuits drew back into a semicircle. One flicked out a collapsible baton. Two more drew knives.', 'Robin caught two lampposts and rubber-band-gunned off them, splattered against the wall of the building across the way, and tumbled down to resume his mostly normal form—a bit stretched—beside Jan. Her sparks glinted off the masks. The tracksuit she’d stunned found his feet, tried to raise his knife, and dropped it.', 'Tiny lightning bolts danced between Jan Chang’s teeth when she grinned. “Nice move. Got any more?”', 'He pulled a quarter from his pocket, cupped it in the webbing of his left thumb, pulled the webbing back three feet, then loosed. The quarter struck the nearest tracksuit’s knife hand with a sharp crack, and he swore and dropped the blade. The others backed up further, into the street. They weren’t scared—just timing for their rush. Waiting to see if he had any more quarters. Robin heard a rumble far away, like people in heavy boots running. Reinforcements? “This was a bad idea. We should have called the cops.”', '“Relax, Ruttiger. I told you, we have backup.”', 'No. Those weren’t booted feet. He’d just never heard hooves on asphalt before.', 'He wasn’t any more ready than the tracksuits for the buffalo charge.', 'There was only one buffalo, but it was easily as tall as the tallest tracksuit, weighed as much as the whole group put together, and was doing forty miles an hour at a charge. The first tracksuit to see the buffalo might have preferred to describe his reaction as a warning cry, but it sounded like a scream to Robin. The tracksuits really were well-trained: without audible communication they realized how the odds had changed, and turned to run, weaving between cars, trying to keep out of horn range.', 'Jan whooped. “Way to go, Chowdown!”', '“You ', 'that buffalo?”', '“Upstairs tenant. Come on! They’re getting away!”', 'So he ran.', 'The tracksuits couldn’t outpace a buffalo on a straightaway, but they ran out onto Bowery and into traffic. Horns blared and the buffalo’s hooves scraped on asphalt. Robin sprang from fire escape to rooftop to rooftop as Jan followed on the ground. Below, he saw the tracksuits split into three groups. “Stay on the north group!” he shouted, and Jan followed them across the road, waving apologies to the cars she ran between. Robin catapulted himself across the whistling gap and landed in a puddle beside Jan on the west side of Bowery. By the time he gathered himself, the tracksuits had vanished around the corner of Houston, but only just. Robin ran, and Jan ran beside him. He might be out of shape but the chase was burning in him now, and beneath that the joy of doing something right for a change. He skidded on the corner of Houston, glimpsed a sneaker and a tracksuit leg vanish around Mott, ran after, Jan thudding behind in her Doc Martens. He forgot to breathe—he didn’t really need to anymore, his skin took all the oxygen his system needed from the air—and his stride was smooth and easy. When he reached Mott he saw them turn east on Prince. Keep it up, keep it up, you’re almost there.', 'When he turned the corner, he stopped and began to curse.', 'A pile of tracksuits and masks lay on the corner of Prince and Mulberry. And Mulberry was wall-to-wall people: eating arepas, dancing to indie folk, lining up at the Korean barbeque burrito stand, drinking beer while doing all of the above. He’d walked through the street fair two days before. He hadn’t forgotten about it. He just hadn’t thought at all.', 'Jan skidded to a stop. “They must have changed shape. After reptoids shed their skin, they glisten in direct light for a few minutes after—we can still catch them.”', 'He sagged. “No. We can’t. We should have called the cops. They would have caught one of these guys. We should have done something, anything even remotely effective.”', '“We saved the shop.”', '“Great! Good. We were real heroes for two minutes! And what now? Do we wait for them tomorrow night, and the night after that? These guys aren’t amateurs. They could have killed us. Next time they’ll bring something to handle your buffalo buddy. This isn’t about reptoids, or mind control, or, what, wacky hijinks. Octavia’s real. We got into this to help her. And we just fucked it up.”', 'Jan took off her sunglasses. Without them her eyes were large and glowed softly. “You think I don’t know that?”', 'This was all wrong. That is, it wasn’t wrong, ', ' wasn’t wrong, they should have called the cops, they should have done everything he said, but still somehow he’d just messed it up worse. Like always. He reached into his pocket for his phone. “I’m tired. I’m calling 911, and I’m going home to sleep. Some of us have work tomorrow.”', '\\xa0', 'Thursday after school, Robin went to rehearsals. He still felt like he’d been crushed by a steamroller—he actually had been once, on the show—but he liked to see how the kids spent the time they could control. After a school day when he’d felt all eyes swivel toward him as he wandered through the hallway, only to swivel back to their own business when he turned, after even Ms. LaJolla pursed her lips across the lunch room table in what he felt certain was judgment, he needed to sit in a dark room and watch someone else take the spotlight.', 'He clapped. He couldn’t stop himself. The kids were good. When he’d been in high school theater, he’d been so impressed by how his friends transformed from the dressing room to the stage, melted by the lights into their roles. Now it seemed staggeringly obvious the girl playing John Wilkes Booth was just fifteen, her mustache pasted on. There was something pure about that, though femme Booth would probably have been mortified to hear him say so: the clarity of performance, the person revealed underneath.', 'After the rehearsal, he congratulated the director—Mr. Cho—and the kids, and ended up in the empty theater with a Broadway actress named Baker (“Like Tom, or Josephine,” she’d said with a half smile in a British accent he couldn’t place, “but Abigail”) who’d come in as a vocal coach, on what he’d heard whispered was a sort of . “The kids love you,” he’d told her after Mr. Cho introduced them, and it was true. Part of that was the Broadway mystique, and maybe the slight lawbreaking edge, but she was glamorous and handsome and tall and had hair like she should have been in ', ', with tattoos on both arms. Booth had blushed and gone corpse-still every time Baker so much as glanced in her direction.', '“They’re perfect,” she said. “I mean, they’re fabulous. Working with young talent like this, with no agents or managers, is sort of the dream, isn’t it? Pure theater. And I say that from the point of view of someone who’s in the wrong line of work. Dealing with them every day, though, probably like ice cream for breakfast all the time, if you’re lactose intolerant. Slightly. Sorry, metaphor needs work. Anyway. Assassins in a high school—bit of an odd choice?”', '“I don’t know. Less so here than most places.”', '“I suppose.” She stretched her arms over her head, and they kept stretching until they reached the ceiling, then snapped back. “Ow!” She rubbed her shoulders.', '“I hate it when that happens to me,” Robin said. “Once I threw my jaw out yawning. How long have you been stretchy?”', '“Just since a few minutes ago,” she said. “That’s me, you know, Abigail Baker, the Understudy.” When she sketched a bow, her arm swooped elongated behind her. “Your talents are my speciality.” When she looked up, her eyes widened in an expression Robin dreaded. “Just a mo. Stretchy. I remember you. Ruttiger—Mr. Rubberband, right?”', '“Just Rubberband. And I don’t go by that anymore. Just Robin, these days.”', 'She really was a good actor, Robin thought. Her expressions were transparent: he could read her trying to stop herself from speaking, then deciding she’d rather not pass the chance. “I watched ', ' religiously. I watched a lot of TV between auditions. When you retired from public life I was so bloody furious. At you, I mean. Yes, we have just met, and it is terribly unfair of me to say, and, obvs, you have no idea who I am, but, new policy, honesty at all times. Back then, here were my thought processes: I’m trying to break in; no luck whatsoever; big debut, gloriously romantic, also an enormous storm of bollocks—and here was this guy who lucked out, got the golden ticket. Only rather than appreciate it, off he goes. Oh thank you so bloody much. I mean, have you seen the world? We don’t really have love, do we? Instead we have celebrities. Those were my thoughts at the time. However. Adulthood. One sees mistakes were made. I was a child. I was being unfair. Now, I really get it. You were right. So, well done there. And thank you for remaining still for all that.” She set her hand on his arm, and his experience of British people was too limited to know whether that felt as forward for her as it did for him—they did the cheek kissing thing over there after all, didn’t they, or was that France? “It’s good to see you happy. To see anyone happy. Well, that is my portion of Too Much Information today, and now I shall retreat—”', '“No,” he said, “it’s all right. Thank you.” And he meant it, more or less.', 'Was he happy? He walked the halls to his office, unsure.', 'His hand was on his office door and his mind on home, sleep, solitude, when a voice like crushed granite interrupted the quiet of his skull. “Mr. Ruttiger? Me and the guys were talking and, um. There’s something you got to see.”', '\\xa0', '“Look, Mr. R, you gotta understand, my jokers and me, we’re not into anything bad, right? We just keep an eye out. Take care of each other. But soon as you start to, like, you hang around, and you get so’s you know each other, and you make up a handshake, a special kind of nod, not meaning anything by it, people get ideas. We’re not doing wrong, right? Like okay maybe once in a while there’s some jokers want to get scrapping on your block, so you scrap back, and sometimes nats come down to start shit with little jokers who can’t defend themselves. Squishy people. I don’t mean you, you’re okay, Mr. R, you got your own back, I’m talking about, like, Smalls, who’s small, or Gabby who don’t have a mouth so she can’t call for help. God made me a rock so I got to be a foundation, you figure?”', '“I figure.” There were parts of Jokertown not even realtors went, buildings that had been rat traps and fire hazards long before the virus, and after that turned weird, shellacked by three generations of joker inhabitants, crumbling masonry glistening with slime, veined by crystal, studded with papery nests for wasps the size of toddlers.', 'By itself, those hazards wouldn’t have kept the street safe. New York realtors had bulldozed and built over worse, and lied about it on the environmental impact statement. But the locals were fiercely loyal, and no one yet had worked up the entrepreneurial gumption to offer enough money to break that bond for an apartment wallpapered with its previous owner’s cast-off skin. Robin had walked most of Jokertown on one lunch break or another, but never this four-block stretch. They didn’t have places like this in Ohio.', '“But you start that and then the police gall you, right, like every group of jokers is a gang or some mafan shit like that. But we heard you and Miss Jan scrapped them tracksuit guys who came for Octavia’s last night.”', '“You heard about that?”', '“Shit yeah, everybody heard! Why you think all and them was watching you all day? Some badass shit man! Wha!” Slade mimed a channel 5 kung fu movie pose, and an uppercut. The ground shook when he bounced on his feet, and rock flour drifted from his joints. “Yeah. So I added it up and thought maybe you’d like to know your tracksuit boys hang out here.” He nodded across the street and down: a building with broken windows boarded up, a weathered illegible sign bearing a picture that might have once been of a car. “They moved in six weeks back. Real serious tough guy shit. We spied ’em, didn’t want people bringing poison onto our street, that’s how jokers get ', ' you figure?”', '“Yes.” It was an ideal hideout: near their target, and cop-free.', '“But they kept quiet. Scoped up by the school—but nobody starts mafan by the school, that’s how jokers get sent up federal. We figured it for okay. But they can’t be hurting on Miss Octavia. I’d go to the police, the Fort Freak crew’s okay, but maybe I go to them and they ask me, Slade, why you coming to us with this now, right? What else you got? And maybe Big X or one of hers sees me going into Fort Freak and asks, Slade, why you in with police now? But you, Mr. R, you’re okay.”', '“Would you be willing to talk to the cops? If I made the introduction?”', '“I don’t know, Mr. R. For Miss Octavia, maybe.”', 'But it wouldn’t be enough. Arresting the tracksuits might slow Mikhail’s plan—if it was in fact his plan—but if they wanted Octavia’s place safe, they needed more. They needed to tie the man to the trouble. “Have you seen a guy in a suit with them? A big guy, with an Eastern European accent?” Slade looked confused. “Like Dracula?”', '“Mr. R, man, they all talk Dracula. And nats all look the same. Me and my jokers, we gotta go to school or else they send for us, so if they do things during the day, we wouldn’t see nothing.”', 'Shit. Okay. Think, Ruttiger. We’ve got a street cops don’t patrol, close-knit community, outsiders will be noticed, but good luck getting anyone to testify. You need documentary evidence. But this was the kind of place where city cameras would keep getting mysteriously eaten. Think harder. Take in your surroundings. There’s the building covered in the thin layer of ooze, there’s the apartment walled in crystal, there’s the wasp’s nest making an uneasy humming noise, and there’s—', '“Slade?”', '“Yeah?”', '“What’s with that apartment there? With three sets of bars over the windows, and aluminum foil?”', '“Mr. R, you don’t want to be bothering her. That’s Mama Salva, she’s straight up paranoid, man. She thinks everyone’s out to get her. You talk to her, and it’s all, the government, and the aliens, and like the Kings of France and shit. My mama says she’s thought there was people out to kill her for at least twenty years. She paid some of my jokers to paint the hexes on, and they said she got the place all wired up, mics and cameras and junk.”', '“Any of them pointed at the street?”', 'Slade’s eyelids ground down over his eyes, then up again. “You can’t be going in there, Mr. R. Mama Salva don’t talk to nobody. She’s going to hex you.”', '“No,” he said. “You’re right. She won’t talk to me. But I think I know someone who speaks her language.”', '\\xa0', 'He didn’t need to jump the fence to reach the stairs down to Jan’s apartment—Jan, it seemed, just lacked patience for the gate. The basement door was unlocked, and the lights weren’t on, so he fished out his phone and soft-shoed through the cluttered dark tool room with its dripping pipes to a shut door beside a washer-dryer, half-hidden behind paint cans, wishing the whole time that he hadn’t been such an unreconstructed dink the night before. The door handle turned, but the door stuck. He leaned into it, pressed harder, shoved. The door gave. He tumbled through into blinding light, and landed on a bear.', 'The bear wasn’t alive, but a bearskin draped over a chair oozing foam out the remnants of its upholstery. The fake fur smelled like dust, but the room was full of sage and incense and weed smoke—not to mention, as he forced himself back to his feet, bulletin boards, twenty of them, on the walls, in freestanding easels, festooned with news clippings and website printouts. The room was a spider’s mess, multicolored yarn lines sagging from pushpin to pushpin across the space between corkboards, and in the heart of that web stood Jan Chang, wielding a broken pool cue as a pointer. A man sat on the couch: squat and broad, the kind of big that didn’t need to suggest muscle beneath the flesh and the ripped jeans and the gold chain and the stained tank top—the muscle was as broadly stated as the rest of him. The big man’s eyes got narrow, and he rumbled up, dislodging a red piece of yarn that linked ', ' to ', ', which was silly, because there ', ' a Prince Charles unless the royals had shuffled while he lost track. “Hey, buddy. This is a private residence here.”', '“Ruttiger! No, Fred, this is Robin Ruttiger. Remember? The guy from last night.”', '“That guy?” Fred didn’t seem encouraged by the association; Robin didn’t blame him.', '“I’m sorry,” he said, hands up. “Jan, I was a jerk last night. But I need your help.”', '“It’s cool, Robin, you were right. I wasn’t thinking about the bigger picture. I sat down to thinking, and that’s where all this came from.” She waved her hands to include the corkboards. “Fred, remember, Robin saved Octavia’s shop, he saved me—he’s okay.”', '“It all gets a bit fuzzy,” Fred mumbled. “You know, the horns and all make it hard to concentrate. Buffalo brains are tiny.”', 'Robin blinked. “You were the buffalo?”', 'Jan frowned at the distraction. “Right, sure. Ruttiger, meet Fred Minz. Fred can turn into animals he eats. Fred, meet Robin. Stretchy guy. Rubberband, Chowdown. Chowdown, Rubberband. Can we get on with this, or do we have to have a crossover special?” No one answered. “Good. Now, as ', ' was saying, after some substantial digging I’ve assembled two competing theories. The first has to do with reptoid manipulation of the Rosicrucian sect and internal Freemason magipolitics which affected the pre-grid street layout of southern Manhattan, interfacing with secret Majestic 12 experiments conducted here through the ’70s and ’80s when Jokertown was an undisclosed federal testing ground for psychoactive weaponry. The other has to do with the fact that our good friend Mikhail Alexandrovitch is a mid-level operator for Ivan Grekor of the Brighton Beach mob. That explains why the goons were so well-trained: the Russian mob has access to a lot of ex-Spetsnaz guys. Good thing Spetsnaz are notoriously weak against buffalo.” Frank chuckled. “Anyway. Alexandrovitch a semi-legit errand boy, emphasis on semi, and real estate development is a great vehicle for money laundering. Our man’s assembled a collective of investors currently operating under the name of the Twenty-First Century Retail Group, who’ve committed a large amount of capital to build a high-rise luxury condominium complex in Jokertown, provided Mikhail acquires the free and clear rights to demolish Octavia’s building. The other owners in the building all accepted down payments over the last year from puppet organizations I’ve traced back to Alexandrovitch—he’s not as good at covering his tracks as he thinks—because they assumed Octavia would never sell. They were right. But now the Twenty-First Century Group’s run out of patience, and Mikhail’s taken matters into his own hands. They’re both compelling theories; I’m not sure how to choose.”', 'Robin boggled as his brain raced to catch up with Jan’s mouth. “How did you put all that together?”', '“I was a financial analyst before my card turned and I had more important things to worry about. But even with the paper trail, we don’t have anything to tie Mikhail to the attacks.”', '“That,” Robin said, “is where I think I can help.”', '\\xa0', '“Back up,” Jan said when they stood in front of the door, with its six locks and chains, its pasted prayers, and the poorly disguised reinforced plates to either side that would have stopped a prospective burglar from just sawing through the wall.', 'Robin retreated a step.', '“I meant, around the corner. The fewer people she sees through that peephole, the better. Plus, all due respect, I look more like a joker.” He didn’t think his expression was that skeptical, but her frown suggested otherwise. “Come on. I can take care of myself.”', 'When he was safely down a flight of stairs, Jan knocked. The locks were heavy, slow and vicious to unlatch. Some of those high-pitched whines you never realized you were hearing until they stopped, stopped. The door opened on at least two heavy chains.', 'The woman’s voice was sharp and cold. “Who are you? Who sent you? What’s the secret?”', '“We don’t have time for the usual protocols.” Jan was talking fast. “I’m with the resistance. We’re being monitored. I need critical information from a secure facility. I was told you’re the person in this district I could trust.”', '“Told by who? What’s the secret?”', '\\n“You of all people should understand that I can’t divulge my contact’s identity.”', 'A considering silence. “What’s the secret?”', 'He held his breath.', '“Blood and gold,” Jan said. “Isn’t it always?”', 'The door slammed. Chains clanked. The door opened again. “Come inside. This hallway’s only Lavender secure.”', 'Footsteps, and the door slammed shut, and locks engaged.', 'Robin sat on the steps and waited. He pressed his thumbs together. A stooped gray woman lurched up the stairs under a layer of groceries; he helped her with them. Two kids came home from school and let themselves into their apartment. On the first floor, someone started practicing trombone.', 'Robin was playing jacks with the kids when the locks disengaged again, and the door opened. He’d been playing by snapping his hands out to catch the jacks (the kids cried not fair, but one of the little hypocrites was telekinetic and the other had gecko palms), so he turned his head all the way round on his neck to face Jan when she emerged. The boy laughed, “Eww, gross!”', 'Jan put her glasses on with one hand. “I’ll never understand the Merovingians.

Tracksuits and masks and everything. We paid them a visit, and one of them remembered where he put his tongue.”', '“Detective McTate.” Mikhail’s eyes narrowed, and he got very smiley and loose. “You have some honest mistake, I am sure.”', '“Not this time, Mikhail.” The rolled newspaper the tall man held compressed and sharpened into a paper blade. “Let’s do this the easy way.”', 'Mikhail’s eyes flicked from McTate to his escort. The smile’s corners turned down, and the gleam in his eyes sharpened into hate. Then he moved, fast—not for McTate, but for Octavia.', 'He didn’t make it. Robin slung out one arm and snared his fist before it could connect. Then Jan zapped him. Then the tabby cat tackled him, only it wasn’t a cat anymore, but a heavyset ginger cop, still missing an ear, but in ample possession of a fist.', 'Police stuff followed after that. The three of them kept it together all the way through. Octavia only collapsed when the cops and Mikhail were gone. Jan hugged her, then glared at Robin until he, cautiously, stepped forward and joined the embrace.', '“I can’t believe it’s over,” she said when the tears were done. “I’ll have to fix the window. I don’t know where I’ll find the money for ', '. But people will keep coming.

      "{'Title': ['The Word of Flesh and Soul'], 'Author': ['Ruthanna Emrys'], 'Body': ['The language of the originators defines reality, every word warping the world to fit its meaning. Its study transforms the mind and body, and is closely guarded by stodgy, paranoid academics. These hidebound men don’t trust many students with their secrets, especially not women, and more especially not “madwomen.” Polymede and her lover Erishti believe they’ve made a discovery that could blow open the field’s unexamined assumptions, and they’re ready to face expulsion to make their mark. Of course, if they’re wrong, the language will make its mark on them instead.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'They say studying the tongue of the originators warps judgment as well as flesh. I’m not doing much tonight to disprove that belief: instead I’m kneeling outside my advisor’s office with a purseful of stolen keys, straining my ears for the echo of footsteps in the dim linoleum hallway. If I’m caught, I’ll be kicked out of the program. If I succeed, I’ll be kicked out anyway—but hopefully with a publication in hand and a nasty footnote for my legacy. Polymede Anagnos, who broke every scholarly law to produce a deprecated translation of the ', '.', 'Make that Polymede Anagnos and Erishti Musaru, who ', ' produced the deprecated translation. Rish, waiting anxiously in our illicit off-campus apartment, deserves that footnote every bit as much as I do.', 'The keys are ordinary metal, old-fashioned, filched from the administrative office as I flirted with the secretary. The ring is rusted. The minuscule handwritten labels are blurred beyond comprehension, or else lost entirely, their history attested only by remnant scraps of Scotch tape. There were newer, shinier rings in the drawer. They seemed more likely to be missed. More likely to hold complete sets as well, of course, but I’m betting on a Lloala scholar’s longstanding resistance to change. What would it take to make Dr. Rallis accede to a lock upgrade? Aside from what I’m doing now, of course.', 'Key after key slides into the lock and refuses to twist. The code-iron knobs in the CompSci building would’ve frozen by now, sent out their silent alarms and refused to turn. But Rallis has the simpler, if unintentional, security of an ancient door whose key must be pulled back a half-step, jiggled twice, and whispered to in the secret language of metal, a process that will push the rusty mechanism into motion once out of three tries. So each attempt lengthens as I try the key not quite in its exact seat, and try again, hoping to find the right combination of brass and steel and space. There is, so far as I’m aware, no real secret language of metal, but I mutter the Blacksmith’s Curse under my breath. If my advisor could hear me, maybe he’d admit that I belong in the department after all: a true student of Lloala, so much of my thought transmuted that even mundane frustration emerges in ancient and hazardous form. I risk myself with every breath.', 'But my pronunciation is good. Better than it’s ever been before—listening for the whisper of shoe against floor, hyper-awareness spills over into my own speech. I hear something new in the words. Not an artisan’s casual anger at a forge too cold or a blade cracked by hidden flaw, but fury at her own imperfection. A curse that reflects back on the one who speaks it, demanding more.', 'When I look down at the keys, I can’t believe they ever seemed interchangeable. Every corrugation stands clear, a dozen landscapes dangling from a ring whose rust is itself a treasury of texture.', 'It’s a long, dangerous minute before I can drag my eyes from metal made suddenly gorgeous. Then I pull out my smartphone. Grateful and disappointed to find the amalgamation of plastic and glass and rare earth as ordinary as it’s ever been, I fumble open the flashlight app. Within the lock, another landscape reveals itself, sky to match the mountains and crevasses of the keys. But only one key matches perfectly. Trembling with adrenaline, I join the two halves. Tumblers click. When I can bear the thought of separating key from lock, I open the door. The inner wards, twining and barbed against Rallis’s acknowledged rivals, part like mist for his once-trusted student.', 'Wan lamplight from the courtyard stripes the office. In the corner, a reluctant computer pays tribute to the demands of university administrators. When not being used to appease bureaucracy, it lies dormant; the bulk of the room is reserved for long paper-stacked tables and shelves of messily labeled artifacts. Herd counts and broken stone receipts, pottery decorated with images of figures making pottery, a night-black stone tablet whose inlaid text reflects moon-like luminance.', 'It’s the tablet I’m after. On loan from the Institut des Arts Éclairé de Paris, it’s a fragment of the ', ' that no one in the U.S. has seen before this week. Dr. Rallis’s reputation won that access, but there are limits to what I can do under his cautious eye. And in six days, Rish and I are scheduled to bring our article before the board of reviewers for the ', '. Once they discover that I forged Rallis’s sponsorship letter, we won’t get a second chance. Our translation has to take account of every fragment we have available. It has to be perfect.', 'There are so many rules for studying the tongue. ', ' ', ' Not that anyone has ever made it. My phone’s still in my hand, but I check the window first. Around the courtyard, the other offices lie dark. I dither: turn on the overheads and risk someone asking Dr. Rallis whether his late night bore fruit, or stick with the flashlight app, less obvious from outside but more obviously illicit if someone spots it.', 'I twist the rod on the blinds to mask my work. Bright stripes wane and vanish. The ', ' fades, then reappears, penumbral in the phone’s harsh beam. A dozen clicks of the camera and I e-mail the images to myself, violating the oath I swore to my advisor in the tongue itself.', 'Tiny fingers on the back of my hand, like a shark’s second row of teeth, testify that obedience has gotten me no further than anyone else. The first knuckles appeared during my second semester like daffodil buds pushing through snow, fully blossomed by the year’s end. There have been other changes since—those that I can see, like the fingers and my tongue, and probably others that I can’t. My insurance won’t cover an MRI without serious symptoms, but there are foods I can no longer eat. Odd sensations plague me on the edge of sleep, vanishing before I’m awake enough to articulate them. The fingers strain until their knuckles ache whenever I reach for something, though they’re too weak and poorly placed to help grasp. My body shows every sign of intense and inadequate study.', 'Phone doused, I crack the door. The hall remains silent. No echoes but my own, when I accidentally step on a loose tile. Out of the building, into the parking lot, starting the car, and all still quiet. I’m off-campus and halfway home before my ruminations bring up a phone-perfect picture of the darkened office, just as I left it. Dark, sure—the courtyard’s radiance blocked by the blinds I wound against prying eyes.', '“Fuck!” This time, at least, I manage to swear in English. I repeat myself several times while I think. I could go back, fix the shade, and hope my luck in avoiding observers holds. That ', ' luck, a die that won’t love me for repeated rolling. Alternatively, I could leave my mistake where I made it, and hope that Dr. Rallis is either distracted tomorrow or just blames the janitorial staff. The dependence of this latter plan on one professor’s absent-minded obsession, rather than on the random behavior of everyone else who might haunt the Language Arts building after hours, decides me. That, plus my eagerness to share my newly captured text with Rish. Between replaying the night’s tedious dangers, and reporting those dangers to a warm girlfriend, there’s no serious contest.', '\\xa0', 'As I squeeze in the front door, I stumble over letters. Rish has spread them across the living room: the kindergarten-style plush-covered Lloala alphabet that someone gave me as a gag gift when I started the program. Hazardous, my advisor informed me, and in poor taste besides. But Rish loves the feel of them, the physicality. Depending on her mood, she sorts them by shape or by intricately differentiated phonemic characteristics. Tonight’s logic isn’t immediately obvious, but it isn’t flat versus curved. Once I get it, I suspect we’ll add another paragraph or three to the article.', 'Rish looks up, green hair swinging in her eyes. “Did you take pictures, yes or no?”', 'I let the grin come out. “Yes. I took pictures.”', '“Show me. But don’t disarrange the letters.”', 'I grab the laptop and kneel beside her. “Hug, please?” She leans against me, warm and comfortable, while the computer wends its fitful way to our wi-fi network.', 'Some of the images are blurred or just too dark. Letters that shone lunar-bright to the naked eye hide their corners in shadow. Is that a ', ' or a ', '? But they’re clear enough to read. And the words are ', ', freed from Doctor Rallis’s vigilant restrictions. Rish hums tunelessly as we read. Or it sounds tuneless to me. The songs have words, she tells me—but whether in English or Lloala or some language never translated, her interior lyrics are as private as a diary.', 'Around us, between her letters, I spread our article notes. Index card distillations of support for our claim: that the narrative traditionally inferred from the ', '’s available scraps is too simple, that Eloar the high priest attains perfection only with the aid of ‘Rochaol, a character who appears at the edges of those well-known shards. Her role is frequently described as “mysterious,” and she’s often supposed to be allegorical—a prototype to the Greek chorus rather than an actual participant in Eloar’s life.', '“Dr. Rallis and I only got through the first two sentences,” I say, filling the space left by Rish’s silent concentration. “But I picked out ‘Rochaol’s name later in the segment—this ', ' to tell us something new.”', '“Mmmm.” She repeats the name’s initial click a few times. Her pronunciation’s better than mine. Perhaps much better. A year and a half into my program, and her less official study alongside, her only physical change is a dusting of orange fur along the back of her neck where clothing tags used to irritate her skin. She’s dyed it to match her hair. “Where does this go in the sequence?”', '“I don’t know yet. What we’ve got for those two sentences—”', '“Don’t tell me what Rallis said.” Meaning, don’t bring up something we suspect is wrong, and get myself tangled in it. Rish may sometimes miss when I’m being sarcastic, but Rallis’s biases have a lot less influence on her. I let her rework the opening while I pour myself into the rest of the text. I should go to sleep—if I’m bleary tomorrow I’ll only exacerbate my advisor’s suspicion about the blinds. But then, it’s not weird for a grad student to be exhausted and sleep deprived. And I’m not exhausted ', '—I’m awake, wired, the poetry of the words dancing through my mind like it never does at school. ', 'There’s a song in my head now, too. Orthodox Lloala studies forbid computerized analysis, or any other tool they’re confident the originators couldn’t have used. The risk of distortion is too great, they say. But the ', ' is an epic, even if a short one; at some point, it must have been sung. And we never sing, either.', '“', '” I sing, and Rish grins and hums along. I scribble glosses, guess wildly at sentences, try to get an overall sense of the story’s shape. Rish notes alternate translations in tiny print, a cloud of specificity hovering around my words like dragonflies.', 'At 5 a.m., I sit back on my heels. I’ve been wrestling with a single sentence for the past forty-five minutes, and have switched to a separate sheet of paper in case I need to tear it up in frustration. “Rish, how do you interpret ', '?”', 'She ignores me for a long minute. We used to fight about this, but I’ve learned to wait, letting her come to the end of whatever mental rosary she’s working through before she takes up my question.', '“', ',” she says at last. “', ' is started but not complete. ', ' is action taken by someone who isn’t human. ', ' is marked. Stained. Blemished. Cursed, poetically.”', '“Look, how do you read this line?”', 'She hums over the troublesome piece. “Ummmmm. Right now? Then Eloar brought—no. Then Eloar ', ' ‘Rochaol into the temple—or the congregation, maybe—because she was being marked by the…the power. That’s weird. ', ' is incredibly generic. It could mean anything from their highest god to the demons that spoil food to test endurance.”', '“Do you think they picked it just to be poetic? ', '—it’s alliterative, but it’s such a weird word choice. You ', ' see ', 'used to describe people in the temple hierarchy.” I spread my hand, palm down. The extra fingers curl like fronds. “Learn the language right, and nothing will ', ' you. It’s a mark of ', ' at enlightenment. So why would he ', ' her?”', '“Maybe we’re right that she’s important, but wrong about the role she plays,” Rish says. “She could be a bad example, or a scapegoat, or a temptation. ‘Raising’ is good in our culture; maybe it wasn’t for the originators.”', '“‘You raise me in the night, early light in the temple of my eyes.’” It’s from a love poem, the first piece we translated together.', '“‘Your body writes the word of flesh and soul.’” She offers the next line automatically, reassuring ritual before returning to the academic argument. “Or it isn’t ', ' good. There could be contextual factors.”', '“Maybe. What other assumptions are we making?”', 'Rish licks her lips and turns from the image on the screen. She gathers letters from the arrangement on the floor, starts to lay out the troublesome word. She rocks when she gets to the second ', '—the alphabet set has only one. I draw the oblong loop on a spare sheet of paper, making sure it’s the same size as the others, and after a moment she slots it in place and finishes with the ', '. She touches each letter in turn, and I join her. I try to feel the word: not just the velveteen shapes on my floor, but how they’d have sat in the minds of the speakers. Someone carved those bright letters in dark stone, almost four thousand years ago. Someone struggled over their sentences, just as I do when I strive to say what I mean, and nothing else, explanations chipped out word by word. Did they always succeed, or like me did they sometimes choose Twain’s lightning bug in place of the lightning? A native speaker of Lloala, raised in the tongue, shaped by its perfection, should have transcended such errors.', 'Speaking of assumptions.', '\\xa0', 'The history of Lloala scholarship is blood and bodies. There have been whole centuries and continents where you could burn for possessing a text outside a monastery or a warding circle, others where you’d bleed on an altar with the letters carved into your wrists. One cult forced sacrifices to spend a year learning the language, twisting their training to produce a fatal sequence of grammatical errors long since lost. Aristotle claimed that one word of the tongue cleaved the heart in two and made the liver vanish entirely; the first modern autopsies delved scholarly corpses side by side with illiterate ones. Brains float in formaldehyde in biomedical archives, fungoid organelles green with the dye that demarcates the effects of study.', 'From the originators’ desiccated glacial cities, no one has ever retrieved a body. All claims about how their speech sculpted their souls are secondhand: later scholars, or their own myth-steeped stories.', '\\xa0', '“What if we’re wrong?”', 'That sets Rish rocking. “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”', '“Sorry, I’ll be more precise. What if the field as a whole is wrong about how the originators conceptualized marking?” Rish slows as she considers this more manageable inaccuracy, and I go on: “Torvald Johannsen, Sthenalus Roda, most of the founders of modern scholarship—they were linguists, but they were also alchemists, obsessed with perfection and purity. We have fragments from the originators that suggest similar obsessions, and we’ve assumed they represented the society as a whole.” I’m bouncing now myself, stimming neurotypical-style to pace the flow of my ideas. “But they spoke Lloala for 1500 years, in a place where landslides could change the geography overnight. At least two sets of accounting records mention trade routes broken when a pass got cut off. Anywhere else, that would lead to isolated pockets of development, different sects on every plateau—they made it work, they kept their empire connected, but there must have been different schools of worship and philosophy, constantly meeting and arguing and losing track of each other. We ', ' talk about that sometimes, but we don’t make the obvious inferences.”', 'Rish is still now. “Johannsen’s fragments all came from three settlements around the same peak. You think they weren’t representative.”', '“That’s my guess. Or that Eloar and ‘Rochaol’s temple were a bunch of heretics. Or that attitudes changed in the seven hundred years separating the two. Eloar’s epic is the earliest thing we have that tells a story. Everything before that is how many goats were born this spring and how much they cost at market. And if Eloar is first, he might be closer to the truth of the language than anything Johannsen studied.”', 'Rish takes my hand. She strokes the logogenic digits, soothing mercurial nerves. “So more changes are a sign of ', ' enlightenment?”', 'I touch the back of her neck. “That doesn’t seem right either.” I’m thrilled by the thought of overturning centuries of placid assumption, of tossing our handful of thorns into every scholarly conference and acidic journal exchange. They won’t be able to escape us. They won’t be able to ', ' us, or pretend that women and madmen—the basket into which Lloala scholars lump Rish’s autism, even as the Psychology department draws complex taxonomies with Rish down one distinct branch of cognitive style and Lloala fluency far along another—have nothing to add to their understanding.', 'But I hate the idea that Professor Rallis, with his insectile eyes and slicked-back ears and propensity for screaming at undergraduates, is closer to perfection than Rish. “That can’t be right.”', '“It could,” says Rish. “But we need to know the truth. Let’s keep translating.”', '\\xa0', 'Anticipation and trepidation and exhaustion are a heady mix, but overwhelming. Letters and meanings blur in my mind, and dawn finds us curled together on the couch, trying to nap. Time feels unreal, a distant fantasy of some natural order for sleeping and rising and eating and working. My back pulses with ache: too long bent awkwardly over Eloar’s story, or an oncoming change spurred by exposure to the epic, or both. I should be at school in two hours, but suspect I won’t be.', 'Eyes closed, head tucked against Rish’s belly, I ask: “Why sneak around studying Lloala, when you could get into any grad program in a normal language like Ancient Greek?”', '“I fell in love with you, not some more convenient lover. And I fell in love with Lloala, too. Even though the originators supposedly didn’t have people like me. Maybe I fell in love with you because you didn’t believe that.”', '“I love the language too, but the idea that these glorious powerful words—that if you speak them just right, you get a bunch of boringly identical people who think like old men with tenure—that’s never made sense to me. What we figured out today, I feel like I should have figured out a long time ago.”', '“They’ll expel you over this. If we get published at all, it’ll be because the journal ', 'a controversy.”', '“They’ll expel me.” And whatever happens after that, I won’t risk turning into another Rallis, the first woman in the endless army of tenured old men. “People will cite Anagnos and Musaru a thousand times, just to argue with us.”', '“Musaru and Anagnos,” she murmurs, and twines her fingers through all of mine.', '\\xa0', 'Professor Rallis has warned me about reviews. In any other field, I’d have mailed out a dozen manuscripts by now for safely anonymized consideration. But Lloala Studies still follow the old way. How could a reviewer judge our paper without seeing the scars from its preparation? So three years into my doctoral studies, I’m still without publications. I may be ready for the dangers of interpreting the originator’s tongue, even speaking it aloud, but Rallis doubts my ability to stand strong before a board of editors.', 'I fear for myself, planning my first submission without my advisor to protect me. I fear more for Rish, who can be daunted by the crowd at a party. But she wants to do it. And rejecting Rallis’s example, I trust her judgment of her own courage.', 'Head pillowed against my girlfriend, I dream of shadowed figures scolding me in calm voices, of willing my spine straight before them while my head swims with vertigo. The phone rings; I flail against the dream’s sticky strands, wracking my brain for how to answer. Rish silences the ringer and hands it over.', '“Hello?” I strain to sound alert.', 'Rallis’s sibilant voice winds through the static of a bad connection. “Polymede, where are you? I need you in my office at once!”', '“I’m so sorry, Professor. I overslept—just give me a few minutes to pull myself together. What’s going on?”', '“Just get over here.” He cuts off.', 'I swear, in Lloala this time, and scramble for clean clothes. Rish hands me a comb. “Did he figure out that you were there? Polymede, tell me you didn’t leave anything in the office.”', 'Confession sucks. “I didn’t. But I closed the shades so no one would see my light, and I think I left them that way.”', '“Polymede!”', '“I’m sorry—I didn’t realize until I’d left. It would have been a bigger risk to go back.”', '“Polymede! You can’t get kicked out before our review. We need your ID to get in.” She wraps her arms around her knees. “You can’t tell him about me.”', '“Maybe it’s not that bad. Maybe he just wants me because he’s made a breakthrough translating the third sentence.”', 'That makes her smile. “He usually calls about ', ' sort of thing much earlier in the morning.”', '“True, but still. Look, you focus on figuring out what ‘Rochaol is up to, and I’ll handle Rallis.” I kiss her as briefly as I can bear. “I won’t be too long, I promise.”', 'But my belly is cold, and the ache quickens in my back. I can fake confidence for Rish, but my terror is the same as hers: that Rallis knows, and I’m about to be kicked out of the program before we can submit the article.', '\\xa0', 'The office is bright with daylight, shades pulled wide. The papers and artifacts seem more accessible this way, but less themselves. I could read for hours, if he let me, without a shiver of discovery.', 'Rallis sits behind the paper-stacked desk, examining the stone tablet. His eyelids flicker, swift blinks over faceted corneas. His eyes are onyx-black from edge to edge, impossible to read. He refuses to take grad students who can’t meet his gaze in interviews. If advisees act too nervous, he foists them onto professors of Romance Languages: Lloala is for the bold.', '“Professor.” I set my coffee on the edge of the desk, maybe a bit too pointedly. In Romance Languages, at least people get to call advisors by their given names. “What do you need?”', 'He stands. He ought to unfold, batlike, but the effect is entirely psychological. Sandy hair falls into his stony eyes, and he pushes it back impatiently. “It has to be you,” he says. His voice is low, a whisper to match his sharp-toothed hiss, more frightening than the unambiguous anger of screaming condemnation. “Lascaris would be worse. Or Alexandros.” Rivals, neither friendly.', '“Beg pardon?”', 'He waves his hand impatiently at the window. I swallow, and make a decision. Yet another gamble. “All right, yes. I came in last night. I’m sorry. I couldn’t stop thinking about the new fragment. I had to try again.” Leaving out my methods, leaving out my partner. I can only hope my story is too simple to show the holes.', 'I shouldn’t be able to tell whether he’s even looking at me, but I feel the intensity of his glare. “And how exactly did you get in?”', 'I smirk—why not? “I figured out the Blacksmith’s Oath.” I wonder if he knows what I’m talking about; I wonder if there are other oaths, unknown to me, that make human motivations as starkly clear as the key’s landscape of molded metal. He’s dropped only hints of what full scholars can do.', 'He comes closer, stalks around me. “No new marks—that I can see.”', '“I haven’t noticed any either.” My spine echoes the lie in sparks of pain.', '“Perhaps it’s only your judgment that’s been damaged.” He hisses again, considering. “Well. Did you learn anything to justify your break-in?”', 'Perhaps it’s the ease of tension that comes with realizing that he’s not going to kick me out summarily. The hopeful implications of that word, “justify.” Or maybe it’s just the fact that I need to answer his question, if I’m not going to lose everything today after all, that makes me take a second gamble. “In this section, ‘Rochaol is definitely a real person—she interacts more directly with Eloar than in any previous fragment. Look at this sentence.” My finger tracks the text that gave us so much trouble. “Then Eloar raised ‘Rochaol into the temple because she was being marked by the power. The implications of this piece alone, for everything we’ve assumed about originator religion—”', 'But he’s shaking his head, an expression of vehement denial that shifts to disappointment before I can be sure of what I saw. “No, you’re being far too literal. See the alliteration—this line is meant to be taken metaphorically.”', '“A metaphor for what?” I demand. Anger slips past my wisp of control. It’s one thing to ignore my aching spine, another to let Rallis smooth our night’s progress away into the camouflage of squirming definitions.', '“For placing his own flaws where he can meditate on them and reject them. Or she might be a scapegoat figure.” He sucks a whispering breath through feline incisors. “This is why you shouldn’t work alone. Late-night epiphanies rarely stand up to scrutiny.”', 'I miss our first few months working together, when he would have at least considered my suggestions. “But there’s alliteration scattered throughout the epic. If we take this as metaphor, we could do the same for any part.”', '“You can take inferences from other clues. For example, if your interpretation makes you question a century of scholarship about originator spirituality, you might want to look for possible alternatives that fit with what we already know. Creativity is important to linguistic study, but it’s not sufficient. Your body of work—if you’re lucky—will add a very small stone to a very large edifice.”', 'I can see the expression on his face, imagine the way it would reach his eyes: his doubt that I’m suited for this work, his suspicion that I epitomize everything that’s made women unsuitable from ‘Rochaol on down.

Two kinds of caffeine before breakfast feels like a good idea right now.', '“And cramps, too?” she asks. My period’s been irregular with the stress of study and sleep deprivation; I think that happens in every department.', '“Not this week. Can you look at my back?” I tug off my shirt, wincing.

The originators, far from any ocean, were fascinated by the way rain and stone disturbed placid mountain lakes. It’s a nice way of thinking about it.', '“', '” I counter. Rish has always been fascinated by Lloala’s alterations, and the new-dyed fur on her neck made her smile for days. I’ve been able to cope with most of my own, but having one where I can’t see it wigs me out. “Can you take a picture?”', 'My phone is nearest; Rish inscribes my pain-curved flesh into its memory alongside the moonshadow words that marked it. I take the device by the edges like some brittle artifact. The screen shows the almost abstract sculpture of skin stretched over spine. Across my ribcage, watermark-pale lines waver like moiré. It makes my eyes ache.', '“Does it hurt you to look at that?” I ask.', '“It feels strange. Not bad, though, just weird.” She traces the lines, and I lean into her touch. It feels so comfortable, and so very far from the sacrifices demanded by our study. We consent to that sacrifice knowingly, when we begin, and yet it comes as a shock every time.', '“Is love enough reason for this?” I ask. “The language can’t love us back. Why do we let it break us?”', '“If anyone’s trying to break you, it’s Rallis. And you aren’t broken.”', '“Him, too. He still thinks ‘Rochaol is allegorical, by the way. A ‘scapegoat figure.’ Maybe he’s right. All these scars the language leaves on us, maybe that’s where the originators put their imperfections. That would be a trick, wouldn’t it? Achieve enlightenment by passing all your flaws, all your impurities, to everyone who tries to follow you to the top.”', '“You’ve barely slept,” Rish points out. “Rallis must have said something horrible—what was it?”', 'I sigh. “He figured out that I’d been in the office—so I told him I got obsessive and came in to look at the stone again. I dropped a hint about what we figured out—what we thought we figured out—and he basically said that any time I believe I’m right and my elders are wrong, I’m being an idiot.”', '“If we’re only right when we’re just like everyone else, what’s the point of training more people?”', 'I curl into her lap and close my eyes. I feel exhausted. “To carry on the originator’s legacy, and to approach their greatness. Or maybe just Professor Rallis’s greatness. He wants people to hold his views in the department after he retires, doesn’t he?”', 'Rish begins humming again. I’m halfway to sleep before she speaks. “Who do you study to become?”', 'I peer up at her through the fog of my lashes. The question worms through my brain, seeking somewhere to settle. “What do you mean?”', '“Supposedly we study Lloala to become like originators ourselves. To make our minds as much like theirs as possible. But no one ever succeeds—and they keep studying, so they must want something else too. Rallis wanted to be like ', 'advisor, and for his students to want to be like him.”', 'Brain still fuzzy, I say, “You must be used to that, huh? People trying to get you to think like them.”', '“People do that to each other all the time. I just ', ' it’s impossible.”', '“Aren’t you afraid that the language ', ' it possible? That if we keep studying, it’ll make us like them?” And that, beyond my frustrations with Rallis and the scars he leaves on my confidence, feels like a truth. It’s why I’ve decided to make this last grand gesture, knowing that afterwards I’ll lose the access that makes most of our study possible—to get out while I’m still ', '.', 'She sighs. “This doesn’t go in the article because there’s no evidence, but I think that at some level, we collaborate with the words to shape ourselves. Or I do.” She rubs the back of her neck. “This feels like something I was waiting for. It makes my body more ', '. If that’s not what the originators got from their language, it doesn’t bother me, because it’s what ', ' want. It shouldn’t have to be the same thing.”', '“I’m glad it makes you happy. I wish I would—I don’t know. To me they feel like scars, and my back is killing me, and I ', ' want that. Maybe I want what you have. To collaborate with the language, without an advisor in the way.” Even if I have to do it with the pitiful scraps of Lloala that have been deemed safe enough to make accessible to the public.', '“Suppose the originators were just a bunch of East African plains apes who didn’t know how to keep words from having power? It was our species’ first try at language. Maybe they summoned something they couldn’t banish without going silent forever, and they were just as desperate to understand it as we are. Would it still be worth it?”', 'The idea terrifies me, and yet it has a certain appeal. Maybe I’m just like the originators after all. “I don’t think I could look away.”', 'None of that answers Rish’s question, of course. And after we submit this article, however it turns out, I’m not likely to get another chance to find an answer.', '\\xa0', 'The remaining days pass in a blur of sleepless anticipation. Rallis demands long hours in his office, quizzes me on classic studies, requires detailed interpretation of the new fragment in their light. Faceted eyes wait impatiently for me to fail again. I stumble home late, hide in Rish’s arms until I can regather the threads of our own theories and the confidence to half-believe them. We spend our short nights working on the manuscript, mustering arguments for uncertainty.', 'When I first started graduate school, I tasted this type of collaboration with Rallis. I wasn’t forced on him; he wanted to prove his teaching abilities on an unlikely candidate—and was at least provisionally impressed by the work I’d done on my own. But I lacked the habits of obedience worn into male students by their undergraduate training, and my insights didn’t mesh comfortably with his. If I were a man, he’d have packed me off to study Aramaic years ago. He isn’t ready to admit failure to his colleagues, but I suspect it’s only a matter of time. Or would be, if I weren’t about to break first.', 'The morning of our review Rallis calls five times, leaving increasingly agitated voicemails as I fail to appear in his office. In the ', '’s waiting room, I proffer the requisite seven copies of the manuscript. I try not to fidget as the clean-cut secretary runs my school ID and scans my sponsorship letter. He doesn’t ask questions, doesn’t seem interested in anything other than our paperwork. Their acceptance rate is low; I wonder how many of these appointments they go through every day. For now, there’s no one but us in the chrome-and-carpet chairs.', 'Rish starts to hum, but silences herself. We wait impatiently, heads drooping, for the hours it takes the reviewers to read the article. At last the door opens. Beyond it lies darkness. I shiver as the wards taste my sweat.', 'Vision clears slowly. The room is old, shadowed. The walls bear carven words: some from sources I recognize, others unknown. The floor is a parquet of dark wood, finely etched with more of the originators’ history. And the crescent dais on which the review board sits in their heavy chairs—that too is word-worn.', 'I don’t want to look directly at the three reviewers. The wards, I realize, haven’t yet fully released my sight. Rish is a shining point of familiarity amid intimidation. Her own gaze, of course, tracks the panoply of words surrounding us, sliding easily away from the board. Perhaps this is easier for someone whose eyes don’t insist on the precedence of faces. I try to do the same, then consider that like Rallis, these scholars might be testing our determination. That would be my job, then.', 'It’s hard to look up. But I think about our manuscript, about the truths and uncertainties that we need these people to understand, and slowly I force myself. I wish I had something like the Blacksmith’s Oath, to make the board and its demands snap into clarity. Of course, if anyone knows words to give insight into minds, as the Oath gives insight into metal, it’s the people here. What do they see when they look at us?', 'That kind of clarity is beyond my grasp right now; looking at surfaces is difficult enough. But under the focus of my exhausted persistence the fog clears, revealing men before me instead of terrors. Terrifying men, but I’m used to those. Their robes and suits hide much—but I see faces scaled by study, skin flecked by obscure symbols, flickers of tentacle and tail. The man in the center appears almost unmarked, save for the medusan writhing beneath the folds of his cowl.', 'He nods, and says in Lloala: “', '”', 'This is one of the few places on Earth where Lloala is the sole language spoken. In offices and classrooms and in post-coital conversation, new tongues intermix with the old, hedging against the risk of each word released.', '“', '” I say. “', ' My undiluted words slip around me like eels, like winds, like living things, and suddenly ', ' is what I want: to live immersed in the power of the tongue, to throw myself on its altar without reservation or return or the constant compromise of living with my scars in the world that makes no place for them. Part of me wants to sink to the ground, to speak all the poetry I know and let it shape me utterly, or sit in silence and listen to the language until it drowns me.', 'The reviewers, though, are used to it. It’s us they find strange. One, cheeks pocked by patches of snakeskin, frowns down. “', '”', '“', '” The reviewer to my left points at Rish with a too-long finger. “', '”', 'This is the end of deception. We don’t know how much we ', ' hide from the reviewers, even if we try. So we take our final gamble. Rish doesn’t look up from the floor as she speaks, but she doesn’t look intimidated either. “', '”', 'The central reviewer taps a sheet of paper. The sponsorship letter. “', '”', '“', '” I admit. “', '”', '“', '” says the long-fingered reviewer. “', '”', 'Rish rocks a little. If there’s a word in Lloala for autism, no one’s recognized it. “', '”', 'I wish they’d bother with introductions. I know the names on the journal’s masthead but can guess nothing other than that the central reviewer is probably Shamas Adini, their editor-in-chief. He glares at her; the thing beneath his cowl stills, poised to strike. “', '”', 'She stares at the words winding the floor. “', '”', 'The man with scaled cheeks sighs in exasperation. “', '”', 'The others murmur at this; Adini leans over to whisper to his neighbor. We’ve stumbled into one of Rallis’s rivalries, treacherous as a misspoken word. Rish ignores it. “', '” Do they hear the anger in her scarcely modulated voice? “', '”', 'A moment ago I wanted to stay in this room forever, immersed in its transformative force. Now I wish we were back in our apartment, where I could bask in her words without worrying about how anyone else would take them. But someone needs to address the social side of the equation. “', '”', 'Dr. Adini laughs—not a pleasant sound, even if better than the glare. “', '”', 'My relief is tainted; I know what he means by that command. If any of these old men seemed to see anything in our bodies beyond scholarly aberration, I don’t know if I could go through with it. But there are no leers, only curiosity and clinical distaste.', 'Chill wafts from the walls. I pull off my cheap student’s robe and drop it on the floor in a puddle of polyester. The tiny buttons on my blouse dig painfully into my fingerpads as I force them loose. Pants, underwear; I’m suddenly terrified that I’ll get my period ', ', naked and under judgment. But I doubt they’d care—it’s my hand they want to see, my newly-scarred spine, the tiny welts on my tongue that ooze ink when I’m nervous. I taste it now, wet and green as swamp moss.', 'Rish’s hands freeze over her own buttons. Her eyes widen. “', ',” she whispers. She repeats the demand, louder. Normally she wears long, loose dresses, soft inside and frilly outside, perfectly matched to her own taste. I shouldn’t have pushed her into ordinary professional clothing.', 'Knowing it will displease the board, I pull her close and unfasten the buttons myself. “', '”', 'She squirms and whimpers, worse as she clumsily yanks her socks off. But oddly, once she’s all the way undressed, she seems calmer. “', '”', '“', ',” suggests Dr. Adini. He steps down from his pedestal—I muffle a shriek—and slinks over to examine her more closely. I still can’t see what’s under his cowl.', 'She backs up. “', '”', 'I get between them. “', '” No word for “buttons” in Lloala, either. But he cocks his head as if she’s a graven tablet from which he wants to brush the obscuring dust, and she’s shivering under the force of it. I need to give her space to recover. “', '”', 'I turn, baring moiré scars to the board. If I closed my eyes, I could reconstruct this room’s every chiseled letter from the draft echoing against my skin. Once again, I feel myself on an altar. But it’s an altar of eyes, my sacrifice not blood but visibility. And this one I make not for Lloala’s sake, but for Rish.', 'Behind me I feel eddies of warmth from the shift of Dr. Adini’s cloak. I resist the urge to look. Something whispers against the cloth, emitting nearly inaudible clicks and whistles.', '“', '” He lifts my hand to examine the superfluous fingers. I try not to twitch—let him think of my marks as isolated phenomena, not attached to a real person. His own hands are ordinary, a little calloused, unpleasantly dry. “', '” He prods my back, and this time I do flinch. He doesn’t seem to notice. “', '”', 'I nod. I want my clothes back. But that’s raw civilized reflex and the deeper, instinctive desire for the illusion of armor. More than those shallow urges, I want to pass through the ordeal of the board’s judgment. I want these men to find our sacrifice worthy, and listen to what we’ve learned, and accept it, and hate it. I straighten my shoulders and lift my eyes. I imagine them naked with all their shameful, pride-earned marks, and myself clothed in words of moonlight.', 'The wards shimmer. Vision flickers and returns. Behind me, a familiar voice rasps, “', '”', 'Rish jumps and squeaks. I manage to avoid anything quite so dramatic. I turn slowly, knowing that if I move too fast my mask will slip.', '“', '” My voice is nowhere near as steady as I’d like. “', '” Stupid thing to say, but I can’t think of anything smart. Shallow desire or no, I scoop my robes from the floor. No one’s given me leave to put them back on, but I hug the pitiful shield to my chest.', '“', '” Adini sounds amused. “', '”', '“', '” Insectile eyes scan the room, unawed. “', '”', 'I take a deep breath. If I were only defending myself I could be frightened, overwhelmed, intimidated. Not for Rish. “', '”', '“', '” says Dr. Rallis. “', '”', 'Rish’s eyes flicker across the carven wall. “', '”', '“', '” says the man with the snakeskin cheeks. “', '” He’s the one who accused Rallis of sending us to waste their time. An ally—maybe? If we can convince him that his time ', ' being wasted.', 'Rallis hisses. “', '” Which makes his adversary Basil Lascaris, one of the journal’s senior editors.', '“', '” says the man who called us “ridiculous” earlier. “', '”', '“', '” And that one must be Cyrus Matraxia. He has a reputation, scholarly and otherwise.', 'Adini, who could put a stop to this in either direction, watches the exchange with shaded eyes. But I can see, in Lascaris’s thin-lipped smile, in the cordial nod that Matraxia exchanges with Rallis, that this won’t be decided by the merit of our work.', 'Rish’s eyes widen. Ignoring the board, she paces around their grand thrones, all her attention focused on the wall behind them.', '“', '” Lascaris demands.', '“', '” I ask. Of course, I know the answer. Words are always words to her, context be damned, not toys or heraldry. Professor Rallis turns his directionless glare on me—clearly I’m responsible for this disruption to the board’s ritual judgment.', '“', 'Lloala ‘chaio', '” Rish demands. “', '”', 'Adini leaves me to examine her find. He doesn’t have it memorized, of course. The board works in this room every day—but reading articles, discussing the latest findings, building old rivalries and friendships with the researchers who’ve been here a dozen times. Easy to let your eyes pass over the familiar. I discard protocol to join them, back aching under Rallis’s glare.', 'It’s colder in the back of the room, as if the carved stone gilds a glacier. Guiltily, I pull my robe over my shoulders.', 'The section that caught Rish’s eye is high in a corner, drenched in shadows from the bas-relief beside it. The letters are worn shallow. The stone is pockmarked and the left edge shorn away, jagged from some cataclysm. But, primed by a week of sleepless hyperfocus, I spot the same thing Rish did. One of the broken words is almost certainly “‘Rochaol.”', 'I point the half-name out to Adini. “', '”', 'He squints, craning closer, curiosity overcoming dignity. “', '‘chaio', '” He tracks the lines with a long finger. “', '” He pauses. “', '”', 'My hand hovers near the worn fragment. Hidden here because it fit neatly into an awkward angle, all its worth dismissed, for decades. Along with the piece we’ve been working on, though, it suggests a world that offered more than one path to wisdom. More than one permissible way of thinking.', 'I’ve been thinking of this whole effort as a swan song. Force them to pay attention, get one perfect publication to horrify all the field’s authorities, and go out in a blaze of glory rather than buckling under the misery of Rallis’s constant criticism. I could bear to give up Lloala’s unattainable enlightenment. But the Lloala hinted at here—that, I want to keep. I could put up with the judgmental old men, the glares and the petty politics, for the sake of the texts to which they guard the locks—if the texts themselves reveal something better.', 'Rish’s lips part in delight. “', '”', '“', '” Rallis’s voice fills with an anger usually reserved for recalcitrant undergraduates. “', '”', '“', '” asks Lascaris.', 'Adini swings back into his seat, waves us to our place in front of the dais. “', 'always', 'now', '” Rish comes reluctantly, my hand on her elbow.', 'We talk them through our translation and the accompanying explanations: ‘Rochaol’s role in the epic, her relationship with Eloar, the proposed connection between her marks and her place in the temple. Rish, utterly beyond the inhibitions of formality, interjects suggestions about how we might now transform these interpretations. Rallis and Matraxia glare at her; Lascaris looks amused. Adini, at least, seems genuinely intrigued. All the while I’m aware that, without Rallis’s access and sponsorship, this is the last time we’ll be able to stand here.', 'We finish, and silence stretches through the chilly room. At last Adini nods formally. “', '”', 'The waiting room is unreal, the catalog-standard furniture like something from another time.', '“You’re expelled,” Rallis tells me, voice deathly calm.', '“I know,” I say. Rish squeezes my hand. I close my eyes tightly, but tears threaten to push through the cracks. I won’t let him see how much this still matters to me.', 'Long minutes later, the secretary sends us back in. The wards are still discomfiting, but my vision clears almost immediately.', '“', '” Adini smiles at us. In spite of everything, I release a breath that I’ve been holding for weeks. If nothing else, I ', ' have my swan song. “', '”', '“', 'not', '” He stuffs hands into his pockets, satisfied. “', '”', '“', '” says Lascaris. He turns his bemusement on me. “', '”', 'Another breath, one I didn’t know I was holding. I’d prefer Adini, whose swiftly drawn connections and apolitical curiosity remind me of Rish. But he makes no move toward an offer of his own. It’s Lascaris, who thinks me a clever way to show up an old rival, or nothing.', '“', ',” I say.', '“', '” He turns to her. “', '”', 'She stiffens at the dismissal. “', '”', '“', '”', '“', '”', 'Lascaris hesitates.

When I started at the university, I didn’t know what I was getting into. I didn’t know how much the study would demand of me, either out of Lloala’s own necessities or the ancient grudges and traditions crusted around that core of knowledge. I almost let them drive me away, and keep it all for themselves—I’m not willing to do that anymore. These old men are never going to give my work the respect it’s due; the tongue will never stop demanding sacrifice. But I’ll decide on my own this time, knowing what I want to learn and who I’m studying to become.', 'No, not on my own. I take Rish’s hand. “', ',” I tell her quietly, and I feel the answer in the strength of her grip.', '“', ',” she agrees.', '“', ',” I tell Lascaris.

The new janitor, Saga, finds herself in the company of an officious steward-bird, a surly and mysterious engineer, and the shadowy Captain. Who the odd passengers are, and according to what plan the ship travels, is unclear.', 'Just when Saga has begun to understand the inner workings of Skidbladnir, she discovers that something is wrong. Skidbladnir is sick. And it’s up to her and the engineer to fix it.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Something had broken in a passenger room. Saga made her way through the narrow corridors and down the stairs as fast as she could, but Aavit the steward still looked annoyed when she arrived.', '“You’re here,” it said, and clattered its beak. “Finally.”', '“I came as fast as I could,” Saga said.', '“Too slow,” Aavit replied and turned on its spurred heel.', 'Saga followed the steward through the lounge, where a handful of passengers were killing time with board games, books and pool. They were mostly humans today. Skidbladnir had no windows, but the walls on the passenger levels were painted with elaborate vistas. There was a pine forest where copper spheres hung like fruit from the trees; there was a cliff by a raging ocean, and a desert where the sun beat down on the sand. Saga enjoyed the view whenever she was called downstairs to take care of something. The upper reaches had no such decorations.', 'The problem Saga had been called down to fix was in one of the smaller rooms. A maintenance panel next to the bed had opened, and a tangle of wires spilled out. The electricity in the cabin was out.', '“Who did this?” Saga said.', '“Probably the passenger,” Aavit replied. “Just fix it.”', 'When the steward had gone, Saga took a look around. Whoever stayed in the room was otherwise meticulous; almost all personal belongings were out of sight. Saga peeked into one of the lockers and saw a stack of neatly folded clothing with a hat on top. A small wooden box contained what looked like cheap souvenirs – key rings, a snow globe, a marble on a chain. The open maintenance hatch was very out of character.', 'Saga shined a flashlight into the mess behind the hatch. Beyond the wires lay something like a thick pipe. It had pushed a wire out of its socket. Saga checked that no wires were actually broken, then stuck a finger inside and touched the pipe. It was warm, and dimpled under her finger. Skidbladnir’s slow pulse ran through it. Saga sat back on her heels. Parts of Skidbladnir shouldn’t be here, not this far down. She re-attached the wiring, stuffed it back inside, and sealed the hatch with tape. She couldn’t think of much else to do. A lot of the work here consisted of propping things up or taping them shut.', 'The departure alarm sounded; it was time to buckle in. Saga went back upstairs to her cabin in maintenance. The air up here was damp and warm. Despite the heat, sometimes thick clouds came out when Saga exhaled. It was one of the peculiarities of Skidbladnir, something to do with the outside, what they were passing through, when the ship swam between worlds.', 'The building’s lower floors were reserved for passengers and cargo; Skidbladnir’s body took up the rest. Saga’s quarters were right above the passenger levels, where she could quickly move to fix whatever had broken in someone’s room. And a lot of things broke. Skidbladnir was an old ship. The electricity didn’t quite work everywhere, and the plumbing malfunctioned all the time. The cistern in the basement refilled itself at irregular intervals and occasionally flooded the cargo deck. Sometimes the ship refused to eat the refuse, and let it rot in its chute, so that Saga had to clean it out and dump it at the next landfall. Whenever there wasn’t something to fix, Saga spent her time in her quarters.', 'The cramped room served as both bedroom and living room: a cot, a small table, a chair. The table was mostly taken up by a small fat television with a slot for videotapes at the bottom. The closed bookshelf above the table held twelve videotapes: two seasons of ', '. Whoever had worked here before had left them behind.', 'Saga lay down in her cot and strapped herself in. The ship shuddered violently. Then, with a groan, it went through the barrier and floated free in the void, and Saga could get out of the cot again. When she first boarded the ship, Aavit had explained it to her, although she didn’t fully grasp it: the ship pushed through to an ocean under the other worlds, and swam through it, until they came to their destination. Like a seal swims from hole to hole in the ice, said Aavit, like something coming up for air every now and then. Saga had never seen a seal.', ' drowned out the hum Skidbladnir made as it propelled itself through the space between worlds, and for just a moment, things felt normal. It was a stupid show, really: a space station somewhere that was the center of diplomatic relations, regularly invaded by non-human races or subject to internal strife, et cetera, et cetera. But it reminded Saga of home, of watching television with her friends, of the time before she sold herself into twenty tours of service. With no telephones and no computers, it was all she had for entertainment. She had already seen all of the episodes, so she picked one at random.', '\\xa0', 'Season 2, episode 5: ', 'The station encounters a species eerily reminiscent of demons in human mythology. At first everyone is terrified until it dawns on the captain that the “demons” are great lovers of poetry, and communicate in similes and metaphors. As soon as that is established, the poets on the station become the interpreters, and trade communications are established.', '\\xa0', 'In the middle of the sleep shift, Skidbladnir’s hum sounded almost like a murmured song. As always, Saga dreamed of rushing through a space that wasn’t a space, of playing in eddies and currents, of colors indescribable. There was a wild, wordless joy. She woke up bathing in sweat, reeling from alien emotion.', '\\xa0', 'On the next arrival, Saga got out of the ship to help engineer Novik inspect the hull. Skidbladnir had materialized on what looked like the bottom of a shallow bowl under a purple sky. The sandy ground was littered with shells and fish bones. Saga and Novik made their way through the stream of passengers getting on and off; dockworkers dragged some crates up to the gates.', 'Saga had seen Skidbladnir arrive, once, when she had first gone into service. First it wasn’t there, and then it was, heavy and solid, as if it had always been. From the outside, the ship looked like a tall and slender office building. The concrete was pitted and streaked, and all of the windows were covered with steel plates. Through the roof, Skidbladnir’s claws and legs protruded like a plant, swaying gently in some unseen breeze. The building had no openings save the front gates, through which everyone passed. From the airlock in the lobby, one climbed a series of stairs to get to the passenger deck. Or, if you were Saga, climbed the spiral staircase that led up to the engine room and custodial services.', 'Novik took a few steps back and scanned the hull. A tall, bearded man in rumpled blue overalls, he looked only slightly less imposing outside than he did in the bowels of the ship. He turned to Saga. In daylight, his gray eyes were almost translucent.', '“There,” he said, and pointed to a spot two stories up the side. “We need to make a quick patch.”', 'Saga helped Novik set up the lift that was attached to the side of the building, and turned the winch until they reached the point of damage. It was just a small crack, but deep enough that Saga could see something underneath – something that looked like skin. Novik took a look inside, grunted and had Saga hold the pail while he slathered putty over the crack.', '“What was that inside?” Saga asked.', 'Novik patted the concrete. “There,” he said. “You’re safe again, my dear.”', 'He turned to Saga. “She’s always growing. It’s going to be a problem soon.”', '\\xa0', 'Season 2, episode 8: ', '.', 'One of the officers on the station begins a relationship with a silicate-based alien life form. It’s a love story doomed to fail, and it does: the officer walks into the life form’s biosphere and removes her rebreather to make love to the life form. She lasts for two minutes.', '\\xa0', 'Saga dreamed of the silicate creature that night, a gossamer thing with a voice like waves crashing on a shore. It sang to her; she woke up in the middle of the sleep shift and the song was still there. She put a hand on the wall. The concrete was warm.', 'She had always wanted to go on an adventure. It had been her dream as a child. She had watched shows like ', ' and ', ' over and over again, dreaming of the day she would become an astronaut. She did research on how to become one. It involved hard work, studying, mental and physical perfection. She had none of that. She could fix things, that was all. Space had to remain a distant dream.', 'The arrival of the crab ships interrupted the scramble for outer space. They sailed not through space but some other dimension between worlds. When the first panic had subsided, and linguistic barriers had been overcome, trade agreements and diplomatic relations were established. The gifted, the rich and the ambitious went with the ships to faraway places. People like Saga went through their lives with a dream of leaving home.', 'Then one of the crab ships materialized in Saga’s village. It must have been a fluke, a navigation error. The crew got out and deposited a boy who hacked and coughed and collapsed on the ground. A long-legged beaked creature with an angular accent asked the gathered crowd for someone who could fix things. Saga took a step forward. The tall human man in blue overalls looked at her with his stony gray eyes.', '“What can you do?” he asked.', '“Anything you need,” Saga replied.', 'The man inspected her callused hands, her determined face, and nodded.', '“You will do,” he said. “You will do.”', 'Saga barely said goodbye to her family and friends; she walked through the gates and never looked back.', 'The magic of it all faded over time. Now it was just work: fixing the electricity, taping hatches shut, occasionally shoveling refuse when the plumbing broke. Everything broke in this place. Of all the ships that sailed the worlds, Skidbladnir was probably the oldest and most decrepit. It didn’t go to any interesting places either, just deserts and little towns and islands far away from civilization. Aavit the steward often complained that it deserved a better job. The passengers complained of the low standard, the badly cooked food. The only one who didn’t complain was Novik. He referred to Skidbladnir not as an it, but as a she.', 'Over the next few stops, the electricity outages happened more and more frequently. Every time, living tubes had intertwined with the wiring and short-circuited it. At first it was only on the top passenger level. Then it spread to the next one. It was as if Skidbladnir was sending down parts of itself through the entire building. Only tendrils, at first. Then Saga was called down to fix the electricity in a passenger room, where the bulb in the ceiling was blinking on and off. She opened the maintenance hatch and an eye stared back at her. Its pupil was large and round, the iris red. It watched her with something like interest. She waved a hand in front of it. The eye tracked her movement. Aavit had said that Skidbladnir was a dumb beast. But the eye that met Saga’s did not seem dumb.', 'Saga went upstairs, past her own quarters, and for the first time knocked on the door to engineering. After what seemed like an age, the door opened. Engineer Novik had to stoop to see outside. His face was smudged with something dark.', '“What do you want?” he said, not unkindly.', '“I think something is happening,” Saga said.', 'Novik followed her down to the passenger room and peered through the hatch.', '“This is serious,” he mumbled.', '“What is?” Saga asked.', '“We’ll talk later,” Novik said and strode off.', '“What do I do?” Saga shouted after him.', '“Nothing,” he called over his shoulder.', '\\xa0', 'Novik had left the door to the captain’s office ajar. Saga positioned herself outside and listened. She had never really seen the captain; she hid in her office, doing whatever a captain did. Saga knew her only as a shadowy alto.', '“We can’t take the risk,” the captain said inside. “Maybe it’ll hold for a while longer. You could make some more room, couldn’t you? Some extensions?”', '“It won’t be enough,” Novik replied. “She’ll die before long. Look, I know a place where we could find a new shell.”', '“And how would you do that? It’s unheard of. It’s lived in here since it was a youngling, and it’ll die in here. Only wild crabs can change shells.”', '“I could convince her to change. I’m sure of it.”', '“And where is this place?”', '“An abandoned city,” Novik replied. “It’s out of our way, but it’d be worth it.”', '“No,” the captain said. “Better sell it on. It won’t survive such a swap, and I’ll be ruined. If things have gone this far, I need to sell it to someone who can take it apart.”', '“And I’m telling you she has a chance,” Novik said. “Please don’t pass her on to some butcher.”', '“You’re too attached,” the captain retorted. “I’ll sell it on and use the money as down payment for a new ship. We’ll have to start small again, but we’ve done it before.”', '\\xa0', 'Season 1, episode 11: ', '.', 'The lower levels of Andromeda Station are populated by the destitute: adventurers who didn’t find what they were looking for, merchants who lost their cargo, drug addicts, failed prophets. They unite under a leader who promises to topple the station’s regime. They sweep through the upper levels, murdering and pillaging in their path. They are gunned down by security. The station’s captain and the rebel leader meet in the middle of the carnage. ', ' the captain asks. ', ', says the rebel.', '\\xa0', 'There was a knock on Saga’s door after her shift. It was Novik, with an urgent look on his face.', '“It’s time you saw her,” he said.', 'They walked down the long corridor from Saga’s cabin to the engine room. The passage seemed somehow smaller than before, as if the walls had contracted. When Novik opened the door at the end of the corridor, a wave of warm air with a coppery tang wafted out.', 'Saga had imagined a huge, dark cavern. What Novik led her through was a cramped warren of tubes, pipes and wires, all intertwined with tendrils of that same grayish substance she had found in the hatches downstairs. As they moved forward, the tendrils thickened into ropes, then meaty cables. The corridor narrowed, so tight in spots that Novik and Saga had to push through it sideways.', '“Here,” Novik said, and the corridor suddenly opened up.', 'The space was dimly lit by a couple of electric lights; the shapes that filled the engine room were only suggested, not illuminated. Round curves, glistening metal intertwined with that gray substance. Here, a slow triple beat shook the floor. There was faint wet noise of something shifting.', '“This is she,” Novik said. “This is Skidbladnir.”', 'He gently took Saga’s hand and guided it to an outcrop. It was warm under her fingers, and throbbed: one two three, one two three.', '“This is where I interface with her,” Novik said.', '“Interface?” Saga asked.', '“Yes. We speak. I tell her where to go. She tells me what it’s like.” Novik gently patted the gray skin. “She has been poorly for some time now. She’s growing too big for her shell. But she didn’t say how bad it was. I understood when you showed me where she’s grown into the passenger deck.”', 'One two three, one two three, thrummed the pulse under Saga’s hand.', '“I know you were eavesdropping,” Novik said. “The captain and the steward will sell her off to someone who will take her apart for meat. She’s old, but she’s not that old. We can find her a new home.”', '“Can I interface with her?” Saga said.', '“She says you already have,” Novik said.', 'And Saga heard it: the voice, like waves crashing on a shore, the voice she had heard in her dream. It brought an image of a vast ocean, swimming through darkness from island to island. Around her, a shell that sat uncomfortably tight. Her whole body hurt. Her joints and tendrils felt swollen and stiff.', 'Novik’s hand on her shoulder brought her back to the engine room.', '“You see?” he said.', '“We have to save her,” Saga said.', 'Novik nodded.', '\\xa0', 'They arrived at the edge of a vast and cluttered city under a dark sky. The wreckage of old ships dotted the desert that surrounded the city; buildings like Skidbladnir’s shell, cracked cylinders, broken discs and pyramids.', 'They had let off all passengers and cargo at the previous stop. Only the skeleton crew remained: the captain, the steward, Novik and Saga. They gathered in the lobby’s air lock, and Saga saw the captain for the very first time. She was tall, built from shadows and strange angles. Her face kept slipping out of focus. Saga only assumed her as a “she” from the soft alto voice.', '“Time to meet the mechanics,” the captain said.', 'Novik clenched and unclenched his fists. Aavit looked at him with one cold sideways eye and clattered its beak.', '“You’ll see reason,” it said.', 'The air outside was cold and thin. Novik and Saga put on their face masks; Aavit and the captain went as they were. The captain’s shroud fluttered in an icy breeze that brought waves of fine dust.', 'There was a squat office building among the wrecks. Its door slid open as they approached. Inside was a small room cluttered with obscure machinery. The air was warmer in here. Another door stood open at the end of the room, and the captain strode toward it. When Saga and Novik made to follow, Aavit held a hand up.', '“Wait here,” it said, its voice barely audible in the thin atmosphere.', 'The other door closed behind them.', 'Saga looked at Novik, who looked back at her. He nodded. They turned as one and ran back toward Skidbladnir.', 'Saga looked over her shoulder as they ran. Halfway to the ship, she could see the captain emerge from the office, a mass of tattered fabric that undulated over the ground, more quickly than it should. Saga ran as fast as she could.', 'She had barely made it inside the doors when Novik closed them with a resounding boom and turned the great wheel that locked them. They waited for what seemed like an eternity as the air lock cycled. Something hit the doors with a thud, again and again, and made them shudder. As the air lock finally opened, Novik tore his mask off. His face was pale and sweaty underneath.', '“They’ll find something to break the doors down,” he said. “We have to move quickly.”', 'Saga followed him up the spiral stairs, through the passages, to the engine room. As she stood with her hands on her knees, panting, Novik pushed himself into Skidbladnir’s mass face-first. It enveloped him with a sigh. The departure siren sounded.', 'Saga had never experienced a passage without being strapped down. The floor suddenly tilted, and sent her reeling into the wall. It was sticky and warm to the touch. Saga’s ears popped. The floor tilted the other way. She went flying headfirst into the other wall and hit her nose on something hard. Then the floor righted itself. Skidbladnir was through to the void between the worlds.', 'Saga gingerly felt her nose. It was bleeding, but didn’t seem broken. Novik stepped back from the wall. He looked at Saga over his shoulder.', '“You’ll have to do captain’s job now,” he said.', '“What?” Saga asked.', '“That’s how it works. You read the map to me while I steer her.”', '“What do I do?”', '“You go up to the captain’s cabin. There’s a map. There’s a city on the map. It’s on the lower levels. It’s abandoned. Tall spires. You’ll see it.”', '\\xa0', 'Saga went up to the captain’s cabin. The door was open. The space inside was filled by an enormous construction. Orbs of different sizes hung from the ceiling, sat on the ground, were mounted on sticks. Some of the orbs had little satellites. Some of them were striped, some marbled, some dark. In the space between them hung swirls of light that didn’t seem attached to anything. Close to the center, a rectangular object was suspended in the air. It looked like a tiny model of Skidbladnir.', 'There was a crackle. From a speaker near the ceiling, Novik’s voice said, “Step into the map. Touch the spheres. You’ll see.”', 'Saga carefully stepped inside. The swirls gave off small shocks as she grazed them, and though they seemed gossamer, they didn’t budge. She put her hand on one of the spheres, and her vision filled with the image of islands on green water. A red sun looked down on pale trees. She touched another, one that hung from the ceiling, and saw a bustling night-time town, shapes moving between houses, two moons shining in the sky. She touched sphere after sphere: vast desert landscapes, cities, forests, villages. The lower levels, Novik had said. Saga crouched down and felt the miniature worlds that littered the floor like marbles. Near the far corner, a dark sphere was a little larger than the others. As she touched it, there was an image of a city at dawn. It was still, silent. Tall white spires stretched toward the horizon. There were no lights, no movement. Some of the spires were broken.', '“I think I found it,” she said aloud.', '“Good,” Novik said through the speaker. “Now draw a path.”', 'Saga stood up, ducking the electrified swirls. She made her way into the center of the room where Skidbladnir hung suspended on seemingly nothing at all.', '“How?” she asked.', '“Just draw it,” Novik replied.', 'Saga touched Skidbladnir. It gave off a tiny chime. She traced her finger in the air. Her finger left a bright trail. She made her way across the room, carefully avoiding the glowing swirls, until she reached the sphere on the floor. As she touched the sphere, another chime sounded. The trail her finger had left seemed to solidify.', '“Good,” said Novik in the speaker. “Setting the course.”', '\\xa0', 'Saga wandered through the empty ship. There was no telling how long the journey would take, but on the map it was from the center of the room to the very edge, so perhaps that meant a long wait. She had gone back to the engine room, but the door was shut now. Whatever Novik did inside, while interfacing with Skidbladnir, he wanted to do undisturbed.', 'The main doors in the lobby had buckled inward, but not broken. The captain had used considerable force to try to get back in. The passenger rooms were empty. In the lounge, the pool table’s balls had gone over the edge and lay scattered on the floor. There was food in the mess hall; Saga made herself a meal of bread and cheese from the cabinet for human food. Then she went up to her quarters to wait.', '\\xa0', 'Season 2 finale: ', '.', 'The station is closing due to budget reasons; Earth has cut off funding because station management refuses to go along with their alien-unfriendly policies. No other race offers to pick up the bill, since they have started up stations of their own. In a bittersweet montage, the captain walks through the station and reminisces on past events. The episode ends with the captain leaving on a shuttle. An era is over. The alien navigator puts a claw on the captain’s shoulder: a new station is opening, and the captain is welcome to join. But it’ll never be an earthlike place. It’ll never be quite like home.', '\\xa0', 'Skidbladnir arrived in a plaza at the city’s heart. The air was breathable and warm. Tall spires rose up into the sky. The ground beneath them was cracked open by vegetation. Novik got out first. He put his hands on his hips and surveyed the plaza. He nodded to himself.', '“This will do,” he said. “This will do.”', '“What happens now?” Saga asked.', '“We stand back and wait,” Novik replied. “Skidbladnir knows what to do.” He motioned for Saga to follow him.', 'They sat down at the edge of the plaza, well away from Skidbladnir. Saga put her bags down; she hadn’t brought much, just her clothes, some food, and her favorite episodes of ', '. Perhaps she would find a new tape player somewhere.', 'They waited for a long time. Novik didn’t say much; he sat with his legs crossed in front of him, gazing up at the spires.', '\\xa0', 'At dusk, Skidbladnir’s walls cracked open. Saga understood why Novik had positioned them so far away from the building; great lumps of concrete and steel fell down and shook the ground as the building shrugged and shuddered. The tendrils that waved from the building’s cracked roof stiffened and trembled. They seemed to lengthen. Walls fell down, steel windows sloughed off, as Skidbladnir slowly extricated herself from her shell. She crawled out from the top, taking great lumps of concrete with her. Saga had expected her to land on the ground with an almighty thud. But she made no noise at all.', 'Free of her house, Skidbladnir was a terror and wonder to behold. Her body was long and curled; her multitude of eyes gleamed in the starlight. Her tendrils waved in the warm air as if testing it. Some of the tendrils looked shrunken and unusable. Saga also saw that patches of Skidbladnir’s body weren’t as smooth as the rest of her; they were dried and crusted. Here and there, fluid oozed from long scratches in her skin.', 'Next to Saga, Novik made a muffled noise. He was crying.', '“Go, my love,” he whispered. “Find yourself a new home.”', 'Skidbladnir’s tendrils felt the buildings around the plaza. Finally, they wrapped themselves around the tallest building, a gleaming thing with a spiraled roof, and Skidbladnir pulled herself up the wall. Glass tumbled to the ground as Skidbladnir’s tendrils shot through windows to pull herself up. She tore through the roof with a thunderous noise. There was a moment when she supported her whole body on her tendrils, suspended in the air; she almost toppled over the side. Then, with what sounded like a sigh, she lowered herself into the building. Saga heard the noise of collapsing concrete as Skidbladnir’s body worked to make room for itself. Eventually, the noise subsided. Skidbladnir’s arms hung down the building’s side like a crawling plant.', '“What now?” Saga said.', 'She looked sideways at Novik. He smiled at her.', '“Now she’s free,” he said. “Free to go wherever she pleases.”', '“And what about us?” Saga asked. “Where do we go?”', '“With her, of course,” Novik replied.', '“There’s no map,” Saga said. “Nothing to navigate by. And the machinery? Your engine room?”', '“That was only ever needed to make her go where we wanted her to,” Novik said. “She doesn’t need that now.”', '“Wait,” Saga said. “What about me? What if I want to go home?”', 'Novik raised an eyebrow. “Home?”', 'A chill ran down Saga’s back. “Yes, home.”', 'Novik shrugged. “Perhaps she’ll stop by there. There’s no telling what she’ll do. Come on.”', 'He got up and started walking toward Skidbladnir and her new shell. Saga remained on the ground. Her body felt numb. Novik went up to the building’s front door, which slid open, and he disappeared inside.', '\\xa0', 'Season 1, episode 5: ', 'The captain’s wife dies. She goes into space on a private shuttle to consign the body to space. While in space, the shuttle malfunctions. The captain finds herself adrift between the stars. The oxygen starts to run out. As the captain draws what she thinks are her last breaths, she records one final message to her colleagues. ', ', she says. ', '.', '\\xa0', 'Life on the new Skidbladnir was erratic. Novik spent most of his time interfaced, gazing into one of Skidbladnir’s great eyes in a hall at the heart of the building. Saga spent much of her time exploring. This had been someone’s home once, an apartment building of sorts. There were no doors or windows, only mazelike curved hallways that with regular intervals expanded into rooms. Some of them were empty, others furnished with oddly shaped tables, chairs and beds. Some wall-to-wall cabinets held knickknacks and scrolls written in a flowing, spiraled script. There were no means to cook food in any way Saga could recognize. She made a nest in one of the smaller rooms close to where Novik worked with Skidbladnir. The walls gave off a soft glow that dimmed from time to time; Saga fell into the habit of sleeping whenever that happened. Drifting off into sleep, she sometimes thought she could hear voices speaking in some vowel-rich tongue, but they faded as she listened for them.', 'Skidbladnir did seem concerned for Saga and Novik. She stopped at the edge of towns every now and then, where Saga could breathe and was able to trade oddities she found in the building that was now her new home for some food and tools. But mostly they were adrift between worlds. It seemed that Skidbladnir found her greatest joy in coasting the invisible eddies and waves of the void. Every time they stopped somewhere, Saga considered getting off to try her luck. There might be another ship that could take her home. But these places were too strange, too far-flung. It was as if Skidbladnir was avoiding civilization. Perhaps she sensed that Aavit and the old captain might be after them. That thought gnawed at Saga every time they stopped somewhere. But there was such a multitude of worlds out there, and no one ever seemed to recognize them.', 'She tore the ', ' tapes apart and hung them like garlands over the walls, traced her finger along them, mumbled the episodes to herself, until Skidbladnir shuddered and she took cover for the next passage.', 'Each time Skidbladnir pushed through to another world, it was more and more violent.', '“Is she going to hold?” Saga asked Novik on one of the rare occasions he came out from his engine room to eat.', 'Novik was quiet for a long moment. “For a time,” he said.', '“What are you going to do when she dies?” Saga asked.', '“We’ll go together, me and her,” he replied.', '\\xa0', 'One day, improbably, Skidbladnir arrived outside a place Saga recognized. A town, not her hometown, but not so far away from it.', 'Novik was nowhere to be seen. He was sleeping or interfaced with the ship. Saga walked downstairs, and the front door slid open for her. Outside, a crowd had gathered. An official-looking man walked up to Saga as she came outside.', '“What’s this ship?” he said. “It’s not on our schedule. Are you the captain?”', '“This is Skidbladnir,” Saga said. “She’s not on anyone’s schedule. We don’t have a captain.”', '“Well,” the official said. “What’s your business?”', '“Just travel,” Saga said.', 'She looked back at Skidbladnir. This was her chance to get off, to go home. Novik would barely notice. She could return to her life. And do what, exactly? The gathered crowd was composed of humans, their faces dull, their eyes shallow.', '“Do you have a permit?” the official asked.', '“Probably not,” Saga said.', '“I’ll have to seize this ship,” the official said. “Bring out whoever is in charge.”', 'Saga gestured at Skidbladnir’s walls. “She is.”', '“This is unheard of,” the official said.

I am the captain,” she said. “And we’re leaving.”', 'She turned and walked back to Skidbladnir. The door slid open to admit her. The hallway inside thrummed with life.

To cope with his grief, Connor spends day after day recreating her potstickers, but they are never quite what he remembers. To move on with his life, he will have to confront his past.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'This is how Connor renders a pot sticker in paper: He crinkles and crumples a circle of white construction paper until it is soft and pliable. The circle is large enough that a tangled ball of shredded paper fits inside with enough room for a generous lip. And it needs to be generous because, unlike dough, paper doesn’t stretch. The ball doesn’t have the heft of a mix of jiucai and ground pork, but it will still push out against the paper once it is folded. He rings the paper with glue, not water as he would have with a circle of hot-water dough. Carefully, he folds the paper over and presses down on the edges to form a lip around the semicircle. Glue seeps out, which he dabs away with a small towel. This obviously never happens with water on hot-water dough. Fold by fold, he crimps the lip so that the semicircle is now a plump crescent. With hot-water dough, folds would just stick together, but this is paper. The folds accordion, and he dabs each with a droplet of glue then presses them all flat. The work is meticulous. When he’s done, the body isn’t the right sort of plump and it doesn’t dimple in the right way. The technique, though, is sound. It takes minutes to make each pot sticker. He makes three.', 'This is what Connor does with three pot stickers made of paper: He stuffs them into a cracked mug. The match hisses when he strikes it against the matchbook cover. It bursts into flame and, when it touches the pot stickers, the flames spread. Golden tendrils reach up, covered by wisps of smoke. The pot stickers blacken and shrivel into the mug. Unlike the first seven times Connor has done this, he’s remembered to open a window and take the battery out of the smoke detector. A piercing beep does not slice his ears. The faint haze in the kitchen clears.', 'It’s not that Connor believes his mom will actually get the dumplings or even that his mom is out there somewhere waiting for burnt offerings. The economy of the afterlife if it existed would have to be pretty screwed up, with people burning paper representations of money and planes and cell phones. Still, he wants to show her he’s learned how to shape a dumpling, even if he still hasn’t figured out the exact filling his mom made.', '\\xa0', 'The band singer’s voice is this slinky, sinuous thing, a voluptuous baritone that nestles around every word he sings. It’s almost enough to distract Connor from the singer’s broad shoulders and the graceful taper to his waist. Those could just be gifts from the singer’s elegantly tailored suit, but Connor has also seen him with the jacket off, bowtie unraveled, collar unbuttoned, and sleeves rolled up. If anything, the suit hides the singer so Connor can pay attention to the song. Connor knows the handsome band singer’s name, Nick, but he’s better off thinking of him as the handsome band singer.', 'To the customers in the restaurant, the handsome man crooning jazz standards and the piano and bass backing him are just set dressing. Nick could be declaiming Wagner or heavy metal and only one who’d notice would be Connor. Everything on the singer’s tiny stage is just a backdrop to the real show, the food.', 'Meals are prepared at the table. Diners in exquisitely tailored dinner jackets and impeccably fitted gowns sit at small round tables. Servers dressed in crisp white shirts and pleated black trousers fulfill their every whim. At one table, a diner’s steak, already patted dry, its flavors already adjusted, sits uncooked on a plate. White streaks of fat alternate with dark red streaks of muscle. The server passes her hand slowly over the steak. It transforms from raw to medium-rare. Clear juice seeps out and is reabsorbed at the server’s command. Another slow wave of her hand and the steak is seared on both sides. At other tables, teams of servers work together to transform and plate ingredients in a strict timeline lest a foam collapse or an ice melt before it can be savored.', '\\nConnor is back of house, prepping. Servers sweep in and out. They place orders and carry away plates loaded with the prepped materials they will transform before their diners’ eyes. The band singer’s song is a sinuous thread weaving through the thud of knives, the whir of motors, and the staccato bursts of servers’ calls and preppers’ responses.', 'A pile of carrots sits at his prep station. It doesn’t even take a glance for him to know how each carrot will taste. One by one, he takes each carrot and adjusts it to its bliss point, that place where it is the most like itself. He crisps its texture, adjusts its color, and intensifies its flavor. Some days, rather than hitting the bliss point, his job is to layer in the bite of pepper or the decadent unctuousness of foie gras. Today, though, all he has to do is make them all the perfect carrots everyone desires but no one can grow. That’s not anywhere near the limit of his abilities. If you leave the trade and then return, though, you start back at the bottom. Leaving to take care of your catatonic mother may be laudable, but also irrelevant. So, instead of working out on the floor, what he does for now is rewind time. Stopping time is impossible. All things fall away from their bliss points as they inevitably decay and rot.', 'The maître d’ strolls up to him as he is chopping, replenishing the mise en place, making it fresher than fresh. She’s never back here. Connor can feel her gaze bear down on him, but she waits until his knife no longer blurs before she says anything.', '“You’ve been requested, Connor. Get into your service uniform.”', '“Can they do that?” Connor turns to catch the sous chef’s gaze. She nods back at him. “And with no notice?”', '“Well, you’re overqualified for back of house. And if they pay enough . . .” The maître d’s wry smile tells him all he needs to know. “You understand tonight’s menu.”', 'It’s not a question, but Connor still rolls his eyes. He has been preparing this menu literally all night. Besides, with a couple exceptions, this restaurant isn’t that ambitious. And no one orders the ambitious items.', '“Good.” She pats Connor on the back. “Go get changed.”', 'The customer sits at the most sought-after table in the restaurant. It’s in a private but spotlighted corner. Noise-canceling hardware embedded in the walls puts the customer in her own private world. Whoever serves her, though, is performing for the entire room. Servers draw straws to avoid this table. Sitting at this table with no advance notice must have cost quite a bit to soothe the ego of whoever originally reserved it.', 'Connor is now dressed in his crisp black-and-whites. As he crosses toward his customer, the band singer starts into Bernstein’s setting of the Ferlinghetti poem, “The Pennycandystore Beyond the El.” A jazzy piece of atonality, this is less crooning for atmosphere than the band singer flashing his expensive conservatory training. The band singer’s eyes sparkle as his gaze meets Connor’s. A smile spreads across the band singer’s face. Connor can’t help but think the band singer is singing just for him. It’s a fantasy he knows he should bury, but he can’t.', 'The fantasy shatters when he sees who has requested him. His sister sits at the table alone, her back to the corner, browsing the menu.', 'Somewhere, right now, a garage door is rattling open and a young boy perks up because it means his big sister has to stop beating him. Their parents cook—not craft—the sweet and fried stuff Americans expect when they think “Chinese food.” Americans expect “Chinese food” cooked by the Chinese to be cheap, so his parents run the restaurant without employees to help them and they work twelve-hour days. Their children go off to school before they wake and are ready for sleep by the time they come home. Sometimes, they are too late and the young boy has already fallen asleep. There are many weeks where the boy sees his parents only on the weekends. His parents have no choice but to leave it to his sister to raise him by herself. This is a lot to lay on a thirteen-year-old girl. None of her friends have to raise their kid brothers. If she thinks having her kid brother dumped on her full-time is unfair—even if it does not justify beating him—she has a point. The rattling garage door means their parents are practically home. His sister never hits him when their parents are at home.', 'When Connor was that boy, perking up just made his sister angrier maybe because it meant he’d get away it. He still has no idea what “it” was. Changing the channel on the TV, not changing the channel on the TV, pouring a glass of soda for himself but not also for her, pouring a glass of soda for himself and also for her: all got him beaten. Telling their parents what she was doing really got him beaten. She never left any bruises, though, and their parents never believed their angel could ever lay a hand on him. Then again, that was also what they needed to believe.', 'Connor’s gut roils as he approaches the table. His sister has pulled any number of stunts on him, and this could be yet another one. He has always gotten the impression that her stunts fill some need in her that he can’t understand. Her best—or worst—stunt to date was to fire Mom’s part-time healthcare assistant once Connor had agreed to move back and take care of Mom part-time. It would have looked bad to the relatives back in Taiwan, his sister insisted, for someone outside of the family to take care of Mom. He couldn’t afford to hire an assistant by himself and his father—Connor knows people his age with grandparents who are older than his father—could barely take care of himself. So, Connor ended up taking care of Mom full-time instead. He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t relieved when she finally did die, even if being relieved makes him a monster.', 'The urn with Mom’s ashes has been sitting on the mantel of his sister’s fireplace for months now. That it’s taken his sister this long to show up is downright sporting. She might really just be here for dinner. That flicker of hope is completely unwarranted, but he can’t help himself.', '“Prue.” Connor stands in front the table. For her, he’s careful to iron all inflection out of his voice.', '“I need you to renounce your citizenship.” She says this as casually as someone who liked him might say hello.', 'And hope dies again. Connor, though, does not miss a beat. He is a food-crafting machine.', 'The request for her order falls smoothly from his mouth. She orders the most outrageous thing on the menu, the scale-accurate model of the Chrysler Building. It’s only there to make everything else look reasonable and affordable. He is aghast, but he merely nods and smiles. His heels click, his body pivots, and he’s gone to the kitchen to gather the ingredients before he realizes he’s even moved.', 'The raw materials that will become the Chrysler Building fill both tiers of his cart. Inertia gives it a mind of its own as he steers it around the tables in the dining room. The maître d’ stops him.', '“Sure you want to do this by yourself? I hear the staff here is top notch.” The maître d’s gaze flicks over to the handsome band singer. “Besides, you already have his attention. Showboating isn’t going to make him notice you more.”', 'The Chrysler Building normally takes five servers and three table bussers to pull off. Conner isn’t building it by himself to prove anything to the handsome band singer, not that he’s against showing off to him. In the moment of reflection before he responds, he realizes he’s not even doing this to prove anything to himself. If the customer were anyone but his sister, he might have put a crew together and put up with their help.', '“No, I can do it.” He wants to push on, but the maître d’ reaches for his arm.', '“Obviously, but that’s not the question.” Her smile is warm and still something Connor’s not used to. “Do you ', ' to do this by yourself? There’s a crew of trustworthy servers and table bussers who’ll help you in any way you ask.”', '“I don’t think that’s the question, either.” Connor pushes on and, this time, the maître d’ lets go.', 'Prue smirks when she sees the cart. Something tightens inside Connor, but he forces her expression to pass right through him.', 'The Chrysler Building is a deconstructed paella composed of discrete floors that become ever lighter and more delicate as they approach the building’s crystalline spire. Garlic and saffron perfume the air as he prepares all the layers from the grouper at the bottom to the clear tomato distillate at the top at once. Various proteins transform from raw to poached as a deft gesture of his hand lifts them off their plates. At a glance, a pot of water begins to simmer and the water is infused with flavors from fish bones and shrimp shells. Within minutes, the water is transformed into savory stock. Grains of rice swirl about an invisible center. They swell and congeal as they absorb the stock that he makes rain down on them. Meanwhile, with another deft gesture, tomatoes dissolve then evaporate. Their clear condensate drips into a gelatin that Connor has crafted in the meantime.', 'Sweat trickles in tiny beads down Connor’s face and back. The building’s foundation, impeccably poached grouper glued into a slab, quivers on a gold-edged plate. As he lowers the next layer, Prue slides documents onto the table.', '“Durable power of attorney.” Prue offers Connor a pen. “Sign it.”', 'For a moment, Connor’s torso stiffens, his back ramrod straight. His rib cage shrinks but doesn’t expand again. Whatever’s inside twists. Asking him to renounce his citizenship was just a bit of anchoring, then. It’s the same trick the restaurant pulls when they put the Chrysler Building on the menu. Prue might want Connor to renounce his citizenship, but signing a durable power of attorney sounds so much more reasonable in comparison. Not that letting Prue act on his behalf in legal matters is a good idea. She still hasn’t told him what this is about. Then again, he also hasn’t asked.', 'He just keeps on multitasking. Everything has to happen at just the right moment or else some emulsion will fail to set properly or some foam will collapse. This is why it takes a team to build the Chrysler Building, or would if he weren’t so intent on proving himself to the uncaring audience. Prue sets her pen on the document. As he continues to craft, she just sits there, her arms folded across her chest, waiting.', 'He falls behind, of course. Not even when he was at his best could he maintain a stock at its bliss point, stabilize a foam, and place a slab of emulsion on an increasingly precarious stack of them at the same time. The foams are stiffer than they ought to be. The transparent flakes of flavored rice emulsion are rough and coarse rather than straight-edged and delicate. He sets them in rows to create the spire with as much precision as he has time for. The rows, one overlapped on top of another, are almost the narrowing concentric arcs they should be. The triangular flakes don’t always point at the tangent of the curve like they should. The effect is not that Art Deco sense of utter craftsmanship. When one is just trying to prevent the building from sagging or, worse, toppling over, one makes trade-offs.', 'The spire floats just above the top layer of gel. With deft hand gestures, he guides it onto the clear tomato-saffron distillate. As he does, Prue grasps at the durable power of attorney. The papers skid across the table before she catches them. The Chrysler Building wobbles.', '“Look, this is just so I can tell the probate court that you want your third of the estate to go to Dad. I know you don’t want it to go to me.” She rolls her eyes. “If you don’t trust me, get a lawyer to draft something that says the same thing.”', 'It takes effort to steady his breath. He is a rubber band being wound tighter and tighter. Prue hasn’t so much as messaged him since the funeral, much less mentioned Mom or probate. Connor saw Mom’s will once, but it must have been lost if probate matters. If they had the will, they’d just execute it. Also, some of Mom’s “estate”—their parents aren’t not exactly rich—must be in Taiwan. Grudgingly, Connor has to admit that having a Taiwanese citizen—to the extent that that’s even a thing—take care of Taiwan probate might be easier. That doesn’t mean having Connor renounce his US citizenship and repatriate to Taiwan makes any sense. Giving his own share to Dad does, though. If anyone had bothered to ask Connor what he wanted, that’s what he would have told them. As best as he can remember, it’s also what Mom wanted in her will.', 'Connor sets the spire in place. The building hardly sags at all.', '“Sure.” His voice is as smooth and level as any layer of emulsion in the building he’s just constructed. “I’ll mail it to you.”', '“Excellent. Let’s settle up.” She pushes back in her chair. “Check, please.”', 'The rubber band snaps in two. It whirs as it unwinds. Its ragged ends flail where no one can see them. They slice the air, whistling with each strike. Their energy is spent in an instant and they lie limp in an unruly tangle.', '“Very good.” He nods, all inflection ironed out of his voice.', 'With a click of his heels, he pivots to retrieve her check. His sister does not leave a tip.', '\\xa0', 'Connor sits slumped on a bench in the restaurant’s locker room. He’s half-dressed. His pants are unbelted and unzipped. His shirt hangs unbuttoned off his torso. Elbows braced against his knees prop up his body as he stares at nothing. Any number of servers and table bussers have asked him whether he’s okay as they changed out of their uniforms and back into street clothes. Connor merely croaks that he’s fine, his gaze still aimed at some point beyond the row of lockers he faces. They all look at him, their eyebrows rise, and they sigh before carrying on with their own lives.', 'He’s still sitting there like that when the handsome band singer shows up. Nick is half out of his shirt when he notices Connor. The shirt hangs off his body by one sleeve.', '“Don’t tell me you’re fine, Connor.” Nick crouches in front of him.', '“Oh. Hi, Nick.” Connor looks up for a moment, then breaks eye contact. “Congratulations. Now that you’ve passed the audition, are you leaving us?”', '“Oh, that. It’s just the district audition. I still have the regional and, if I’m lucky, the national after that.” Nick shrugs. “I’m sorry some customer didn’t even touch your work.”', '“Not some customer. My sister.” Connor is too tired to resist any longer, so he lets the handsome band singer fill his gaze.', 'For all the width across his thick back and the way his chest and arms pop, Nick isn’t built like some statue of Hercules. He’s soft enough to read as human rather than demigod. His mouth opens and closes a few times before he finally speaks again.', '“So, that’s your sister.” His gaze narrows, his lips purse, and distaste spreads across his face. “Am I supposed to slap you now?”', '“What?”', '“You told me once that if you ever let your sister railroad you into anything again, I should slap you.”', '“Oh, right.” He actually had said that. They chat in the locker room surprisingly often. “No, I really do want my share of my mom’s assets to go to my dad. It’s what she would have wanted. I just need to get a document from a lawyer to that effect that will hold up in court.”', 'Connor rolls his eyes at Nick’s skeptical gaze. The handsome band singer has heard too many stories about Prue. Granted, Connor was the one who told him all of them.', '“Can you afford the consulting fee?” Nick stands and finally pulls off his shirt. “I can spot you the money. Pay it back when you can.”', '“No. I got it.” Connor yawns. “They’re letting me pull extra shifts here.”', 'Nick’s gaze does not get any less skeptical. He goes back to his locker and pulls on a T-shirt. It manages to be both baggy and revealing on his body. Only now does it occur to Connor that he should change out of his uniform, too.', '“Want a ride home?” Nick pulls on a pair of jeans. “You look like you’re going to fall asleep on the bus again.”', 'Back in civilian clothes, Connor shuts his locker. Now that Nick is fully dressed, looking at him doesn’t feel nearly as illicit. Nick, for his part, has chatted with Connor in every possible state of undress including naked. Illicit may not be how looking at Nick is supposed to feel.', '“No, I’ll be fine.”', 'It’s cold out, and that’ll keep Connor alert enough to get on the bus. Sometimes, he gets lucky and he wakes up in time for his stop. Other times, well, he’s never not made it home.', 'Nick frowns again. He pulls on a thick coat. It ought to obscure the taper from his shoulders to his waist. It doesn’t.', '“Look, if you ever want a ride—”', '“I’ll ask.” And, after an awkward pause, he adds, “Thanks.”', '“Well, safe travels, Connor.”', 'Nick slams his locker shut and leaves. His walk is jaunty, stepping in time to a sea shanty only he can hear. Connor collapses back onto the bench, but then forces himself back up and puts on his coat. It’s freezing out, and the bus waits for no man.', '\\xa0', 'The lawyer that the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office recommended to Connor is three bus transfers away. It takes Connor several hours to get to her office. He shivers off the snow then hands the receptionist a check. The consulting fee has to be paid in advance.', 'The lawyer’s office is cozy and warm. A large desk sits between them. The lawyer is way more ambitious than he is. She leans forward, asking him to come back with documentation about his family and Mom’s assets. When it becomes clear that he can’t afford any more than this visit, she scribbles out something that her office will make presentable for him to give to his sister. Her reluctant expression and audible sigh screams “against my better judgement.” Maybe it’s just pity, but he’s not proud.', 'Shifts at the restaurant come and go. If Connor wants to chop vegetables and adjust the texture and flavor of meat for hours at a stretch, his fellow servers are happy to give up those shifts. There are a couple rough weeks where Nick is gone, preparing for and, ultimately, winning his regional auditions. More than once, Connor’s not sure how he’s gotten home.', 'The time Connor doesn’t spend at the restaurant, he spends in his own kitchen, a thin strip of linoleum flooring at one edge of his tiny apartment. Mom’s pot stickers won’t recreate themselves. The extra shifts at work now pay for flour, pork, vegetables, and spices. He figured out the hot-water dough a while ago. As winter thaws into spring, he is still puzzling out the filling.', 'The dough rests in a bowl covered by a damp cloth. In another bowl, he mixes pork, scallions, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil by hand. A savory, salty meatiness with a slight jab of heat fills his mouth as the mixture squishes between his fingers. He frowns. The flavor is still not what he remembers. He tamps down the fire from the scallions as he works the ingredients together. In retrospect, he should have stuck with jiucai.', 'He rolls out the dough into a long snake. One by one, he rounds the small clumps he breaks off between his palms. Forming the tiny balls of dough used to be his job when he was too young to pay attention to how his mom made the filling. Just like he’s doing now, his mom would roll out each ball into a circle, put in a dollop of filling, then crimp the circle into a dumpling. When he’s done, several dozen of them form a neat grid on the floured table.', 'He crafts rather than steams then fries the dumplings. No one wanted Connor to spend the years training to be a food crafter. Well, except for Connor, but no one cared what he thought. Since he is a food crafter, though, there’s no point to not taking advantage of that. Whatever made Mom’s pot stickers Mom’s has nothing to do with a bamboo steamer or frying pan.', 'The dumplings bobble into the air. They plump with steam and are seared so that they all have crunchy, slightly oily, and savory crusts. Unlike anyone using a steamer and a frying pan, he can hit the bliss point exactly every time.', 'He slides a plate beneath them, then lets them fall. Juices dribble down his chin when he tries one. It’s fine, perfectly cooked even, but it’s no more than that. It doesn’t taste like Mom’s. They never do. He can diddle with the flavors. Hell, if he put his mind to it, he could make the dumplings taste like a crisp, tart apple tinged with cinnamon and cardamom. What he can’t do, at least not yet, is make them taste like the ones he remembers, the ones his mom made when he was fourteen when she wouldn’t show him what to do no matter how much he begged.', 'He pulls a journal out a drawer. The cover is tattered, and variegated pages paint swirls along the edges formed when the pages stack as the journal is shut. A bookmark sticks out the top. Each page has the flavor of a batch of dumplings he has made. This way, he never tries the same dumplings twice. He opens it by the bookmark to a blank white page. He scrawls today’s date on it, then infuses it with the flavor of this batch. Streaks of green flow down the yellowing page.', 'The journal goes back into the drawer. The dumplings go into a resealable plastic container. They’ve become surprisingly popular at the restaurant’s staff meals. Connor, however, can’t make himself eat them.', '\\xa0', 'The maître d’ hands Connor a notebook that has “Mom’s recipes” written in his sister’s precise handwriting on the cover. Connor’s hands shake so much, the notebook vibrates. His heart pounds. The notebook is probably not what it looks like but, as always, he can’t help hoping. He pushes past her and several startled servers, and nearly crashes into a table busser as he sprints out of the dining room.', 'Customers in their elegant dinner jackets and evening dresses wait in the restaurant’s lobby. They sit on overstuffed sofas and chat as they wait for their tables. Connor manages to halt his run just as he reaches them. He catches sight of Prue just as she pulls on the door to leave.', '“What is this?” Connor is standing next to the maître d’s stand, holding the notebook out at her.', 'Prue turns around. She rolls her eyes and purses her lips.', '“What does it look like?” Her head shakes in disbelief. “I ', ' you’d thank me.”', 'Her tone is sharper than any knife. Connor is convinced Prue doesn’t have any other way to speak. That said, the sharpest knives make the cleanest cuts. You barely feel them. They slide rather than tear through the flesh.', '“So everything went okay with probate?” He clutches the notebook to his side. “My share of stuff went to Dad?”', '“Oh, that.” She turns around and pulls open the door. “I got Dad to give his share to me. I’m in a better position to deal with it.”', 'She is out the door before Connor can collect himself. He just stands there watching the door close. The customers do an admirable job of chatting with each other and waiting as though Connor and Prue were not talking at each other from across the lobby.', '“Are you all right?” The maître d’s voice takes Connor by surprise. “Take the night off. It’s not like you haven’t earned one, or ten.”', 'He turns to the maître d’, now back at her stand. A forced smile breaks his face.', '“No, I’ll be fine.” He holds up a hand, as if to press her away. “I just need to get back to work.”', 'He rushes back into the dining room before she has a chance to respond. The rest of his shift is a blur. Customers are served. Water is transformed into seasoned beef stock then into a powder that is sprinkled on top of an emulsion of onion and gruyere that sits on top of parmesan-coated cracker. Veal shanks become their braised, tender selves and are infused with the flavors of tomatoes, rosemary, and bay leaf. Foams that taste of apple and cranberries float over a bed of puff pastry. Food seems to craft itself.', 'It hasn’t, because, after the shift ends, he is sweat-soaked, stripped to the waist, and collapsed on the bench in the locker room. The noise of slammed locker doors, zipped zippers, and chatty servers surrounds him. People ask him whether he’s okay as they pass by, and he tells them he’ll be fine in a minute. When he sits up, the locker room is empty. He takes the notebook his sister gave him out of his locker.', 'His heart starts to pound and his hands shake as he opens the notebook. The hope that bubbles in him makes him queasy. Years of searching and experimenting could be over in an instant because of help from, of all people, his sister. It’s not impossible Mom told Prue her recipes. Prue was the one Mom expected to be interested in cooking. It’s not impossible that Prue would write them down. Writing them down for Connor is a bit of a stretch. Passing Mom’s recipes down, though, would make her look good to their relatives.', 'When he reads the first recipe, the bubble of hope growing inside him bursts. He riffles through the notebook. The pages rustle past. Spare text in his sister’s airy hand is spread across each page. It’s a definitely notebook of recipes, just not their mom’s.', 'He snaps the book shut, expecting to dash it against the lockers. Anger is supposed to shudder through him. Instead, he laughs.', '\\nHis arms squeeze the notebook to his chest. His laughter is a hand saw ripping through wood. Air leaves his lungs before it’s had a chance to enter and tears fill his eyes.', 'He stops only when he realizes he’s no longer alone. At some point, the handsome band singer, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, entered the locker room. Connor snaps straight, seated on the bench, the final laugh choked in his throat.', 'Nick’s gaze sweeps across Connor. It stops at Connor’s tear-filled eyes.', '“What did your sister do to you this time?” Nick’s gaze is gentle, as though he actually wants to know. “Would you like a hug?”', 'Connor smiles as he wipes the tears from his eyes. He shows Nick the notebook.', '“What she gave me is absolutely not a notebook of Mom’s recipes.” Connor sets the notebook on the bench. “You know how you can look at a piece of music and know how it will sound?”', '“Oh, you can look at a recipe and know how it will taste.” Nick sits next to Connor on the bench. He pats Connor’s knee. “I’m sorry, Connor.”', '“No, it’s fine. It’s weirdly well meaning, actually. Anyone else—well, maybe not anyone else ', ', but anyone else—might believe these are my mom’s recipes and stop trying to recreate them.” Connor shrugs. “That’s just the way my sister is. She’s never going to change.”', 'Connor starts laughing again. It’s more gentle this time. He’s hunched over, and his shoulders start pumping up and down.', '“What’s so funny?” Nick picks up the notebook and starts thumbing through it.', '“Mom’s dead. Probate’s settled. If I don’t want to, I don’t have to deal with Prue anymore.” Connor forces the next words out. “And I don’t want to. Does that make me a monster?”', '“Then don’t deal with her anymore.” The smile on his face is kind, not cruel. “It doesn’t make you a monster.”', '“Um, Nick.” Getting these next words out is like summiting a mountain. “Can I have a ride home? I don’t—”', '“Sure. Any time. It’s my pleasure.”', '\\xa0', 'Connor doesn’t invite Nick into his apartment. He wants to, and Nick even looks a little disappointed when Connor doesn’t and just says goodbye instead. The apartment, though, is a mess. Besides, there’s something Connor wants to do tonight, and he needs to do it alone.', 'Nick’s car disappears down the street. It’s an odd thing, such a big man in such a small car. When Connor first saw it, he wondered how Nick would fold himself into the driver’s seat. Maybe he’ll ask for another ride sometime. Take another crack at figuring that out.', 'His kitchen is the one neat area in his apartment. His training is too ingrained in him for the kitchen to be anything but pristine. All the surfaces have been wiped down. Everything is in its place.', 'He opens a window. It’s spring, and the breeze that drifts in is not freezing. The battery pops out of the smoke detector with a practiced ease. He places a stockpot on the floor and puts into it: his dumpling journal, the notebook his sister gave him, and a lit match.', 'Journal pages char, curl up, and slowly become ash. The scent of steaming dumplings perfume the air. The smell is not the one he remembers from when he was a kid, but it still reminds him of watching his mom cook. She’d roll out tiny balls of dough, fill them, and crimp them so quickly, he never had a chance to work out how to make the dumplings for himself. She always refused to show him, saying she’d always be around to make them for him.', 'She, of course, will never make them for anyone ever again, and he needs to stop trying to recreate them. Prue, much as he hates to admit it, has a point. That doesn’t mean he won’t say goodbye to her, too.', 'The notebook pages catch fire. The burning paper smokes. Black rings eat away at each page. Grey wisps stretch up, tangling with one another as they go. A thread of bitter weaves itself into the tapestry of flavors.', 'Connor sits in front of the fire. Flames lick the sides of the stockpot. Individual tendrils dart up. The fire is a hungry creature licking its prey. The paper curls and shrinks with faint crinkles and crackles. Slowly, he breathes in the fragrant and the bitter as he watches his memories render into ash.', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2019 by John Chu', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Dadu Shin']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['His Footsteps, Through Darkness and Light'], 'Author': ['Mimi Mondal'], 'Body': ['An act of compassion puts a trapeze master in India on a collision course with a terrifying supernatural power.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'I am not a fighter. I am a trapeze master.', 'At the Majestic Oriental Circus, which had been my home for two years, I had climbed the ropes deft and fast, till I was the leader of a team of about fifteen aerial performers. It was in my genes.', 'There were other rewards, too, of the circus life. It had brought me into the grace of Shehzad Marid. A trapeze master has no lack of duties, training and overseeing his team, but I continued to perform with Shehzad in his grand stage illusion show—“Alladdin and His Magic Lamp.” I took great pride in my own trapeze act, and the team that I trained from scratch, but I have to admit that “Alladin” was the crowds’ favorite.', 'None of the credit for that popularity was owed to me. I am a genius at the ropes overhead, flinging myself from grip to grip so gracefully you would believe I could fly; but on earth, up close, I am a man entirely devoid of charm. Before I joined the circus, I did not even speak a language that could be understood in polite society. Even now, I fumble for the right word at the right moment; I occasionally slip into an accent that makes the city people sneer.', 'But as Alladin, all I had to do was to put on a pair of satin pants and a skullcap, and parrot a series of memorized lines. I had never met an Arab street urchin, nor had an inkling what all the words meant, but neither had anyone in the audience. I bellowed, “Ya Allah!” and “Shukr hai!” and “Dafa ho ja, shaitaan!” at my cues. The girl who trained the parakeets doubled as the princess in a shiny ghagra and choli, adorned with tawdry sequins. Johuree, our proprietor and ringmaster, completed the cast as the villainous Zafar, dressed in a moth-eaten velvet cloak.', 'It was an almost ridiculous performance, but it turned into the most renowned act of the Majestic Oriental Circus, all at the touch of Shehzad Marid. As the three of us hemmed and hawed through our scripted gibberish, the jinni would emerge from his lamp in clouds of curling smoke. Illuminated by our cheap stage lights, the clouds would take the shape of a magnificent palace, the gaping maw of a cave, raging armies on horseback that crashed into the audience until our entire circus tent would erupt with gasps, applause, and cries of horror and disbelief. A small child could hold open his palm and receive a dancing houree, crafted immaculately of ice as the clouds condensed. Then they billowed up again—into monsters never heard of; swooping rocs; clerics whose voices soared in prayer across minarets that pierced the sky above a faraway, mythical city; hundreds of jinn, and back to the only one. It was a show unlike anything offered by any rival circus company in our land.', 'I was assigned to this act four months after I joined the Majestic Oriental Circus—a naïve, illiterate, village young man who had been given a job by Dayaram, the former trapeze master, almost out of pity. It turned out that I climbed better than anyone else on the team, but I had never seen a circus before, could hardly follow the shimmering line between illusion and truth. Before I took over, Johuree would play both Alladin and Zafar, disappearing behind the clouds and reappearing in changed costume with a lightness of foot you would not expect from a fat, middle-aged man like him. But then, no one at the Majestic Oriental Circus was merely what met the eye. The circus life is not for the mundane.', 'Johuree had been happy to delegate Alladin to me. An agile young man was more suited to the role than himself, he had said with a wink in front of the entire company. I nodded along, though both of us knew that was just the cover. A circus troupe had no dearth of agile young men. No—we both knew it was because I was the only other person at the Majestic Oriental Circus that Shehzad Marid had entrusted with his lamp.', 'I was a hack Alladin, awkward and bombarding, nothing like my fluid, almost lyrical performance on the trapeze ropes. It made the entire act of “Alladin and His Magic Lamp” come across as gaudy, over-the-top. That was just the effect Johuree was going for.', 'We were a traveling circus, never spending more than a week or two in the same city, town, or village fair. So the day Johuree declared that we would travel to Thripuram to perform at the wedding of the raja’s daughter, we packed up our tents and bags and set out on the journey.', '\\xa0', 'There is little power left in the hands of the rajas of yore, but you wouldn’t think so if you were at the palace of the Thripuram raja on the day we arrived. Accustomed though we were to the illusory palaces of Arabia that Shehzad conjured up three shows a day, our entire troupe gazed awestruck at the vibrantly painted temples, spires, courtly residences, and finally, looming over them all, resplendent in its intricate balconies and mythological frescos adorning the walls, pillars, and steps—the palace itself.', 'The palace grounds teemed with musicians, poets, storytellers, snake charmers, tawaifs, nautankis—entertainers from all over the land. Those traditional artists had been assigned living quarters inside the buildings. A circus was a foreign entertainment—our troupe an unrestrained mingling of men and women of indistinct lineage, sharing space with monkeys, elephants, birds, tigers. Though we had been invited to perform on the night of the wedding, we were allowed to sleep only in our own trucks and tents. We set them up within the palace grounds, under the sky.', 'The grounds were thrumming with activity as we rolled into our spots. The hot afternoon air was cloying with the aroma of outdoor cooking, for all the poor people of the city were to eat two meals at the raja’s generosity every day of the festivities. There were two queues of revelers waiting to be fed—one for Brahmins, another for the infidels and the untouchables—winding as long as the eye could see. Wedding guests wandered within the premises, trailed by servants holding umbrellas, fans, and jugs of water. Massive electricity generators growled along the palace walls, powering thousands of lanterns and strings of light. It was a spectacle more modern and grandiose than anything Shehzad could pull up from the myths of a distant past.', 'If the circus was a novelty to the raja’s palace, it was no less a novelty to us—our entire troupe was comprised of people who had grown up poor. We dealt in glitter and illusion, but all our clothes were cheap synthetics and sequins, often threadbare and sewn together in places; our jewelry made of glass, tinfoil, and paint. We had never seen so many varieties of silk, so many diamonds, rubies, and emeralds casually glittering under daylight as the royal guests wandered by. At lunch, my trapeze team would not stop eating until I threatened them with immediate unemployment if any of them disgraced me at the night’s performance.', 'As the busy day waned toward sunset, conch shells were sounded, and there was instant silence within the palace grounds. A procession of young women emerged from the doorway of the palace, led by a priest. Each of them carried a holy tray of prayer offerings.', 'The women were indescribably beautiful, more so in their dazzling, elegant attire, reminding me of the sculptures of apsaras—heavenly dancers—that I had only seen before on temple walls. These women were not dressed like the wives or daughters of the royalty, yet they were too demure, too distant from us. They did not speak with, or even look at, any of the other performers, who stepped back to make way for them to pass.', '“Devadasis,” whispered a girl from my trapeze team, her voice nearly choking in awe.', '“What are they?” I whispered back. I was completely ignorant of the customs of royalty, but even Shehzad, who was less so, stared uncomprehendingly at these women.', '“I have never seen one of them before,” the girl explained under her breath, never once taking her eyes off the fascinating trail. “You never see a devadasi—no commoner does, except on occasions like this. Devadasis are holy courtesans, bequeathed at birth to the patron deity of a kingdom, maintained by its king. They are trained as dancers, but not like any of us. They will never perform before a commoner, or in exchange for money. Their dance is an act of worship. They are divine.” The girl’s words swung gently between envy and faith. “The devadasis will now go to the town’s main temple to seek blessings for the raja’s daughter. Offer themselves up in performance. The wedding can only take place after the kuldevi—the patron goddess of the kingdom—has bestowed her blessings.”', '“No one told me there was anything supernatural in this town,” I said, intrigued. Two years ago I would have laughed at any mention of such things, but enough time at the Majestic Oriental Circus opens the mind to all kinds of possibilities.', 'The girl laughed. “Who said anything was supernatural? Everything’s a joke to you, Binu’da. I meant ', ' divine, like priests are divine. Devadasis commune with the gods. They are born into holiness. They don’t do tricks with sleight of hand and offstage machinery. That’s what people come to ', 'for.”', 'I stared again—the face of the young woman at the head of the procession was so flawless and serene that I could almost believe in her divinity. Priests were born into the Brahmin caste, and I had met enough Brahmins in my life to know that not all of them were priests, or even had a shred of spirituality in them. Usually they were arrogant and corrupt, frankly quite despicable people to know. But the gaze of this woman was clear and resolute, fixed at the vermilion sky toward the temple where she was headed. Her step was graceful, undoubtedly perfected through the lifelong dance-worship to which she was devoted. No creature could be further removed from the giggling girls in my circus, whose brittle poise disappeared as soon as they stepped behind the stage.', 'Afterward, we returned to our tents to prepare for our show, which was to be the opening performance of the wedding celebrations. We were not there to watch the devadasis return.', '\\xa0', 'The show went off smoothly. My boys and girls could hardly keep their eyes off the ornate ceiling of the raja’s court as they swung and swerved across it, but none of them faltered at their act. “Alladin and His Magic Lamp” was a roaring success with the royal wedding guests. Shehzad was stoic through all of it—he had seen his share of palace interiors in his time. The raja came down from his throne to shake our hands after the show, but we were never introduced to the princess, who had watched our performance from a latticed balcony above. No common entertainer was permitted to speak with the royal bride, even if they performed at her wedding.', '“Really, Binu, stop staring at that balcony and shut your mouth,” Shehzad snapped at me as our troupe filed out of the royal court. “You make yourself look like a fool.”', '“Hey, Alladin is meant to be really popular with the princesses, right?” I teased him. I was still decked out in the satin-pants-and-skullcap attire. “But this pathetic Alladin can’t even catch a glimpse of a real princess. What good is having a faithful jinni at your command if he cannot even introduce you to a princess?”', '“Princesses look just like other women,” Shehzad sneered. “And this one is getting married already, so you’re out of luck. You’ve met the raja. His daughter probably would have the same, uh, ', ' nose. Hopefully not also the generous moustache.”', 'We guffawed, eyes shining into each other’s for a fleeting moment. Then I said, “But you saw all those devadasis. Think about it. If mere women of the court can look like that, the princess must be—”', '“The princess is not one of those women,” Shehzad said, making a sharp turn away from the direction of the lavish dining arrangements.', '“You will not dine with us?”', '“Since when did I eat the same food as you people, Binu?”', '“But you always come along and make the pretense,” I said, surprised at the brusqueness that I did not entirely feel I deserved.', '“That’s when we dine with the rest of our circus troupe, to make sure that no one suspects otherwise,” he replied. “There are too many people at this place. Too much going on. No one will miss Shehzad Marid.”', '“I will.”', '“I must retire to the lamp,” he said, as if shaking off the hurt in my voice. “These festivities will continue late into the night, and our troupe begins to pack up at dawn. If I slip away now, I can steal a few hours of respite.”', 'I always carried the lamp in our trunk of clothes, scrubby enough to look like a circus prop. The actual prop was a cheaper but shinier replica, tossed around on the stage between Alladin and Zafar. No human hand but mine had touched the real lamp in the past two years, and with nothing but gratitude. Nothing but love.', 'Nothing but that inchoate sensation of wistfulness that congealed in my chest on the nights that I lay awake in our tent, gazing at the lamp on my bedside after Shehzad had receded into it. If I picked it up, it would be cold, weightless—a thing forged centuries ago in a distant land; a curiosity, but not an especially valuable one in itself. It was a common household object, Shehzad once told me; street vendors in Arabia sold great quantities of them to this day. With regular use, it would have lasted about five or six years.', 'But this lamp had survived centuries, traveled hundreds of miles from its homeland, passed from hand to bloody, victorious hand. My callused trapeze-artist hands could barely contain it. Another century or two will blow over any trace of my fingers from its surface, as perhaps from the spirit it enclosed.', 'From the stories people tell, even those in our own hack show, the lamp sounds like a prison. The listener imagines himself being suffocated, neck twisted, limbs folded at painful angles, squeezed into a box too small to contain his body and left there to wait for decades. But the listener of the tale is human—imprisoned already in his withering flesh and bone, the measured years that are given to him. The human mind can barely fathom the bond between its own body and soul. What would it grasp of the relationship between a jinni and his lamp? What could I—hardly a philosopher, never having read a book, barely literate enough to scribble my own name—grasp of it?', 'In our two years of friendship, I had learned every detail of Shehzad Marid’s humanity. There was no man, or woman, that I knew better. I could read each of his smiles, each raised eyebrow, each cryptic comment for exactly what it was. But I had also learned that his humanity was mere performance. He was relieved to shed it, as I was to remove my circus costumes and makeup. Shehzad Marid’s greatest gift to me was the knowledge that I would never truly know the core of his existence, and not merely because I was unread.', 'And perform he did, never cracking, never missing a beat, longer than any of us at the circus. No one but Johuree knew, or suspected, anything about Shehzad’s true nature. Even when he manifested in “Alladin and His Magic Lamp,” weaving his way through wonders that no human could pull off, it was carefully designed to look like a triumph of stagecraft. Because I loved him, because I would never understand him at any greater depth than that, all I could do was to give him a break from the act when he asked.', '“Wake me up if you need something,” he told me before he left, adding, “but do spare me if it has more to do with princesses. You need to find yourself a different jinni for that.”', 'I smiled, squeezed his hand, and let him go. Where would I—Trapeze Master Binu of the Majestic Oriental Circus—find a different jinni, and why would I ever want another?', '\\xa0', 'It was past midnight when the members of the troupe retreated to our tents. Within the palace, the tawaifs were still dancing for the last sleepless revelers, but the palace grounds were now empty, for the common revelers had long since departed. Getting into my bed, I pressed a finger against the cold metal of Shehzad’s lamp, but did not drag it. I needed my rest as much as he needed his.', 'I must have barely drifted into blissful slumber when I woke up again at a hushed commotion from the trapeze artists’ tents. It was the second hour of the night, still too dark to see without a light. A couple of girls came running to our tent.', '“It’s a woman from the palace, Binu’da!” they informed me. “Says she wants to have a word with you.”', 'I couldn’t recall talking much with any woman at the palace. Who would come looking for me in the dead of the night? I turned up the wick of my oil lamp and stepped out, sure that whoever it was must have mistaken me for someone else.', 'The woman in question was dressed in a simple sari, her long hair flowing over her back. I was startled to recognize the head devadasi of the Thripuram raja’s palace—the woman whose face had launched me into a thousand speculations earlier that day. With the expensive drapes and jewelry removed, she looked no older than sixteen or seventeen.', 'Seeing her now, the first emotion that hit me was panic. Even speaking to this girl could probably get me punished by the raja. “How did you come here?” I blurted out. “Has anyone seen you?”', '“I told my maids that I wanted to pet the tigers,” the girl said, and shrugged nonchalantly. “No one in this palace had ever seen a tiger before. And I am known to be willful.”', '“The tigers have been sedated for the night—” I started to say, but she cut me off.', '“The tigers can wait. I want you to let me sneak into your circus and escape this wretched palace.”', '“What?!”', '“I have been dancing for fifteen years now, ever since I learned to walk,” said the girl. “There’s no trick any of your girls can perform that I can’t pick up in just a few days. I will be the best performer you’ve ever had.”', '“But you are a devadasi!” I peered in astonishment at the wide-eyed, long-lashed face that was no less attractive for its bareness. “You live at the palace; you have more luxuries than any of us can imagine. You commune with the gods! Why would someone like you want to stoop to the circus?”', '“And what does communing with the gods generally entail, do you think?”', 'I had to admit I didn’t know.', '“I live at the palace, but I am not a princess. None of my clothing or jewelry belongs to me. I don’t actually have a single possession that cannot be taken away with a command from the raja. I do not employ my maids—they maintain my household but also keep an eye on me, report my activities to the raja. Tell me why the raja spends so much money keeping women like me?”', '“Because you commune… ?” My own words sounded ridiculous to me.', '“That’s what it says in the scriptures, doesn’t it?” said the girl. “The priest communes with the gods with his mind, and the devadasi communes with her body. I wouldn’t know—I was never taught to read the scriptures. I’m illiterate as they come. Reading is not a devadasi’s function. Though I could tell you all you ever wished to know about dance, about communing with higher powers with my body. Make a man of you too, if you wish.” She gave me a saucy smile, but it felt more dangerous than inviting.', '“If you don’t like this life, why don’t you go back to your family? Why fling yourself at a group of strangers like this?” I asked.', '“Because you’re the only strangers at this wedding who would take me,” said the girl. “You’re an odd bunch. You don’t belong to any traditional system. There are all sorts of performers in your group—surely you can find some use for a devadasi? No one else has any need for me. Devadasis don’t belong to families. We are bequeathed to the gods—we cannot be possessed by men, be that father or husband. My mother was also a devadasi, as was grandmother before her.”', '“But some man must have fathered you, seeing as you’re just as human as I am,” I said. “His is the house where you should go, even if you don’t like them, or they you.”', '“The raja? But I already live at his house!” The girl startled me with a mirthless laugh. “Of course, I don’t count as the raja’s daughter, because a daughter can only be born of a man and a woman. Devadasis aren’t women; we are offerings made to the patron goddess, entitled to be consumed by the maker of the offering once we have been touched by the goddess. I am not even an illicit child, merely a blessing received by my mother in the performance of her role, more property added to the coffers of the raja who owned her. I am cleverer, more beautiful, more talented than the princess whose wedding you graced with your performance, but she is the princess, and I am property. I am less than even the common free woman in the street.”', 'I’ll be honest—I had never heard anything like that. Not that I ever understood the elaborate social intricacies of the upper classes, but I always knew that I did not trust them, and her story just seemed to confirm my mistrust. If what this girl was saying was true, I could not possibly tell her to go back to the raja’s palace. But it was also impossible to imagine her at the circus—with her delicate step, her sheltered view of life, those smooth white hands that had probably never done a day’s work.', 'I told her so.', '“The circus is no life for a lady like you. You have only seen us in performance. You cannot begin to imagine the sweat, heat, dust, filth, and flies on the road; sleeping huddled in tents; washing with animals in public ponds; the tasteless slop that we eat; the insecurity and physical labor that make up most of our days. I doubt you have the grit to survive it.”', '“If that is so,” said the girl, “I will part ways with your circus once you deliver me to the nearest city. I have heard that our traditional dance is being made secular in the cities, that there are dancers who are well respected in the community without belonging to any king or any temple. They give performances for the public, teach classes, save their own money, and can also marry and have children if they wish. If I make it to the city, I will find ways to survive. All I need is safe passage out of here.”', 'Something about this girl had touched my heart the very first time I saw her at the head of the holy procession. I didn’t wish to call it infatuation, but Shehzad had noticed it too—it was what made him testy enough to retreat into his lamp. True, if she hadn’t come to me, I would never have sought her out, but I would also have gone on believing that she lived a life just as ethereal as her face, devoted to worship and virtue that more common people like myself could not afford.', '“Don’t think I don’t intend to compensate you for your assistance,” the girl said, giving me a smile of such well-honed coyness that it made my heart do an inadvertent leap. “I had no money to bring, but once you take me to the city, I promise to make you memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life.”', '“There’s no need for any of that,” I said, recoiling at the insinuation. I looked up at the sky—there were still a couple of hours before we were scheduled to leave. By the time the rest of the palace started waking up from the previous night’s revelries, the Majestic Oriental Circus would be well on its way.', '“Go to one of the girls’ tents and get some sleep,” I told our new stowaway. “We have a long day’s journey ahead.”', '\\xa0', 'The sky was clear, a deep rouge spreading over the eastern horizon when the Majestic Oriental Circus began its preparations to leave the Thripuram raja’s palace. Half-asleep, disheveled performers emerged from their tents, which were then unmounted and loaded onto trucks. The birds and animals clamored to be fed before they were secured. At my instruction, the young devadasi had changed into clothes from the other girls of the troupe and blended in with them, just in case anyone from the palace was keeping watch as we filed out. I went to have a word with Johuree.', '“The Majestic Oriental Circus has always been a refuge to outcasts and runaways,” he began, and I nodded. “But this woman is beholden to powers beyond ourselves.”', 'The diamond in Johuree’s false left eye pierced me with a red glint from the rising sun. “By giving her shelter, you have taken on charges that are yours alone.”', '“If any trouble comes of this girl, I promise to step up to it,” I told my trusted employer and friend. “She will be fed and clothed out of my salary. I will protect and instruct her, and make sure she finds lodgings in the city when we get there. The circus will not have to bear any responsibility for my decision.”', 'Shehzad was not pleased when he emerged.', '“I have never seen a bigger fool than you,” he grumbled, skulking around the gathered props and trunks that were the farthest from the newest member of our troupe. “A pretty girl comes simpering with a sob story, and suddenly Trapeze Master Binu is the gallant savior we all lacked. Why do you think she did not go to any other guest at the wedding? Why not appeal to Johuree directly, if she wanted to join the circus? She came to you because she had noticed you stare at her earlier like a mesmerized child. She knew you wouldn’t be able to say no.”', '“I suppose you’re right,” I said, trying to rest a hand on his arm, trying to pull him into a reluctant embrace. There was no use trying to disguise my thoughts from Shehzad. “But that does not prove that she’s wrong in trying to escape, or that the people who would decline to help her are correct. I am doing the right thing here, Shehzad, even if it’s not the most practical thing to do.”', '“I have served warrior after warrior, as far back as I can remember,” he said. “A few of them were unkind masters, but others were loving and respectful, though they still owned me. There are worse lives than that of a glorified slave.”', '“But now you are free. Wouldn’t you say you prefer the change of circumstances?”', '“No one is ever free, least of all a jinni. Only the nature of the master changes,” Shehzad replied curtly before turning to walk away. “If I am free now, it’s because my master wishes me so. My next master may be worse, as may that girl’s or any other’s.”', 'I stared at his receding back, the taut, defiant muscles that I longed to knead with my palms, to remind him that I had never been his master. But that would have to wait for another time, far away from this palace with its loathsome practices.', '\\xa0', 'The skies began to grow ominously dark as soon as our trucks rolled out of the palace gates. Clouds rumbled. Tree branches cracked overhead. Waves of dust rose on the distant horizon. Within the town of Thripuram, as we passed, the few early risers hurried to return inside; doors and windows were noisily shut. It was a storm as unseasonal as any in this part of the land.', 'The trucks were the closest we had to homes, in fair or rough weather, so we trudged on until we were on the dirt roads that led out of the town, and could simply go no farther. Unrestrained by any more houses, the winds came pounding at our canvas walls like solid boulders. The trucks swayed like they were wooden toys for children, not hundreds of tons of machine on wheels. Inside, our animals screamed and rattled against their cages. Dust clouds covered the sky, obscuring the sun. Our drivers could no longer see the road. Dust, razor-sharp and unforgiving, filled the eyes and nostrils of anyone who tried to look outside.', 'Usually, a heavy rain comes lashing quick on the trail of a dust storm, calming the winds and weighing down the dust into mud, but it had been an hour since this dust had risen, and there was still not a drop of moisture.', 'As I sat in the first of our trucks, a massive trumpeting from the truck behind us told me that the elephants had broken free, and another tearing, heart-wrenching wail followed as one of them was blown away by the winds. In all my thirty years of life, I have never heard anything like it.', 'The third truck, carrying the clowns, fire-eaters, and my own trapeze team, soon turned to its side with a sickening lurch. From my own truck I could hear none of their voices, although in my guts I could feel them crying, praying to their respective gods, groaning as they scrambled in blindness, bones trampled and crunched. The girl whom we had rescued from the palace was among them too. Perhaps Shehzad was right—if we all died in this freak apocalypse this morning, I would have proved to be a worse master than the raja, not only to her but to everyone else in my care.', 'I am a man who has left his own forest deities far behind in his past, so there was no greater power to whom I could kneel. In any case, if all these other pious people’s prayers were going unheard, how might I—faithless of heart—sway any god to my favor?', 'A heavy figure swayed its way through the truck and dropped heavily, purposefully next to me. It was Johuree.', '“Trapeze Master Binu, you promised to bear responsibility,” he whispered into my ear. Each of his words fell like the gong of a temple bell, cutting through the mayhem outside my brain.', '“What—this dust storm?!” I was stunned by his suggestion. “You think ', ' have something to do with this?”', '“I did warn you that the girl you rescued was beholden to powers beyond ourselves.”', '“I thought—I thought you meant the Thripuram raja and his administration!”', 'Johuree said nothing, just stared at me with his cold eyes, both living and stone. Nothing was enough.', '“I don’t know how to… I don’t know who—”', 'The crashes and screams returned, closing in on my senses like water over the head of a drowning man. So I rose to my feet, staggering from wall to wall as the floor of the truck churned beneath me and dropped myself into the dust-filled darkness.', '\\xa0', 'There was nothing, absolutely nothing to see. My eyes, ears, and mouth were assaulted by dust as soon as I hit the ground. Dust scraped against my bare legs beneath my dhoti like a thousand razor blades. In less than a second, every inch of my skin felt like it was being flayed. I could feel the blood trickle down my arms, legs, chest; I could feel my face growing muddy with blood.', 'Coughing, choking, spitting, I called out into the nothingness, “Here I am: Trapeze Master Binu. I think it is me you want.” I spat out more dust. “Spare the rest of the circus. They took no part in my decision to rescue the girl.”', 'I waited, struggling to breathe. Feeling foolish.', 'Then a voice came, responding to my cry. I do not know why I remember it as a female voice, because it did not even sound human. It came from the wind, molding and resonating as a blend of dust and words.', '“I am the kuldevi of the kingdom of Thripuram,” she said. “Stupid human, filthy, untouchable low-caste whom no god will deign to claim for his own, did you think you could run away with my property and pay nothing for your crime?”', 'Her insults did not perturb me—I have heard them and worse from people, and expected no better from their gods—but the words still made my blood boil.', '“No man or woman is anyone’s property!” I spluttered through the dust that clogged my mouth. “Not the Thripuram raja’s, not even yours. I don’t care if you are human or goddess. You are not ', ' goddess, as you well know.”', 'The thick, blowing dust rippled with laughter. I could feel it dance on my skin as the grains freshly scoured the bleeding surface.', '“A free man, are you?” More words formed. “A man who acknowledges no master, and surely no charge? Then when the men, women, and animals of this party of fools die, as they will within the next hour, their deaths will not be on your conscience.”', 'I wanted to scream back that their deaths should be on the conscience of this vengeful goddess, but I did not even know if the gods possessed consciences; besides… just the thought of their deaths deflated the righteous rage in my heart. My strange but upright boss who had employed me when no one else would, my colleagues and friends who received me as one of their own, the young boys and girls whom I hand-picked and trained for my trapeze team—none of whom I had consulted before I brought down this mayhem upon them. I was a free man till my last breath, but none of them should have to bear the consequences of my freedom.', '“Take my life. Let them go,” I pleaded.', 'Another gust of laugher, another whiplash of dust across my body.', '“And why would I be sated with one mortal life when I came here prepared to take fifty, including the life of that traitorous whore who dares to defy being beholden to me?”', 'I did not know what else would sate her. I am a poor man with hardly any treasures. I had kept aside a few rupees from my salary for the past two years, hoping to return to my mother and buy a house when I finally had enough. I could not imagine my modest savings would buy the lives of the Majestic Oriental Circus from the kuldevi of Thripuram.', 'The goddess seemed to read my thoughts.', '“It is heartening to see you realize the utter triviality of your existence, Trapeze Master Binu,” she spoke “Your puny mortal life and its possessions are every bit as worthless to me as you think. But there is one thing you own, much more valuable than your life, for which I will let your entire circus go, even that filthy whore and yourself.”', 'I waited, dry tongue scraping the dust that now formed a crust on the roof of my mouth, wondering what she meant.', '“Give me the jinni.”', 'The bottom of my stomach dropped.', '“The jinni is not mine to give,” I murmured.', '“It is the only possession of yours that interests me,” said the kuldevi. “Jinn are rare in this part of the world. I have never seen one before, yet I felt its presence and desired it as soon as it crossed into my dominion. But I cannot take it by force, for the laws that bind the jinni to its human master are forged in a distant land over an oath to a different god, far beyond my powers to bend. Give me the jinni of your own free will, and you and all your company will live.”', 'I shut my eyes, which were suddenly muddy and stinging with the tears that had that rushed into them. My heartbeat was slow, irregular. If it were only about me, I would have gladly died at this moment in this dust storm conjured by a wrathful goddess whom I did not worship. And then there was an arm around my waist, holding me upright again, there was a hand wiping dust, blood, and tears from my eyes. It was Shehzad Marid—ever loving, ever loyal, always on my side in my hour of need.', '“I know you did not call for me,” he whispered in my ear, “but a jinni can summon himself into action when his master is in grievous danger. Your body and mind can take no more of this, Binu—mortals are not made for extended interaction with the divine. Let me go with the goddess, but before that, let me take you back to the truck to be among your people. It will not faze me; I have known worse. Give me your command, and I will obey.”', 'I clasped his hand in mine through the dust and the blood, trying to absorb the warmth of his fingers like a man clutching at straws as he drowns.', '“I… am… not… your… master.”', '“We will continue that debate another day,” he laughed, but the laughter fell more like a wounded howl on my ear. “I am sure your path will bring you to Thripuram again. I hope I have a kind master by then, one who will not object to me sitting and chatting awhile with an old friend.”', 'And suddenly, I had an idea.', '“Kuldevi of Thripuram,” I called out again, summoning the strength that was dripping away from me. “I know you cannot possess Shehzad yourself, so you must give his ownership to one of your human worshippers. If that man turns rogue, or if he dies before passing on the ownership to another worshipper, Shehzad will forever be lost to you. He may turn vengeful, and you have never seen the vengeance of a jinni whose master is dead—there is no precedent in your land for anything like it. Your land will be laid barren; you will be left without worshippers.”', 'I pulled myself up with Shehzad’s arms. “Instead, let me come with him. Both of us will serve you for exactly the length of half of my remaining life. He is loyal to me; and you have seen inside my heart—I am a man of my word. When that period is over, we will leave, and no harm will come to you or your worshippers.”', 'More silence, more storm, and then words again. “Half of your remaining life is hardly seven years,” sneered the goddess.', 'That was less than I would have hoped for, but I had no tears to spare. An early death was better than spending long years of my youth in the captivity of the kuldevi of Thripuram, better than dying this minute, never holding Shehzad in my gaze again. My life was a blink in the eternity that Shehzad would have to spend with other masters—what could change between us in a few years, more or less?', '“But you speak the truth,” said the goddess. “This jinni of yours will not come with me willingly, or reveal to me any of its secrets. None of my priests is acquainted with its true nature—they know nothing but children’s stories and misleading spectacles like the one you put up with your circus. Despicable as you may find me, foolish, arrogant man, I do bear responsibility for the well-being of my worshippers. I resent your paltry offer of seven years, but I will accept it. Come to my temple in Thripuram before sunset and devote yourselves by ritual.”', '“Binu, why—?” Shehzad started to protest, but I squeezed his hand and said, “Shh,” as the winds began to dissolve around us.', 'There was no further interruption from the goddess. In the emerging sunshine we stood holding each other, surrounded by the debris of the beloved circus that had been our family and life.', '\\xa0', 'The first person I went looking for was the rescued young devadasi. She was injured, terrified, but—like the other members of the circus—had heard nothing of our encounter with the kuldevi of Thripuram. I let it stay that way. No one else had to bear the burden of my choices, or my guilt.', 'In our last hours, Shehzad was kinder to the girl, mending a fractured wrist with underhanded magic, giving her advice on how to survive in the city all by herself. I saw them smiling together, head to head, and I could feel the sun’s rays warming my battered bones. “Savithri is quite an extraordinary woman, really,” Shehzad came back to inform me, “brave, level-headed, no airs about herself. I can see why you were taken by her. I have no doubt she will do very well in the city, maybe even become famous.”', 'Savithri—I rolled the name around on my tongue, realizing that in all this time, it had never occurred to me to ask.', '“Shehzad…” I started to say, pulling him aside.', '“No.” He placed a thin, immortal finger to my raw lip. I would have cried then, I would have dropped to his feet and asked for forgiveness, but I was afraid that he would cry too, and I had taken enough devastation for a day.', 'Johuree agreed to take charge of Savithri in my stead until the circus reached the city, and make sure she was well settled and safe before they left. Johuree had heard nothing of our bargain with the goddess either, but of course I had to tell him.', '“I will find you once you are released of your bond,” he told me, pressing a bag of money that I had done nothing to earn into my hands. “Doors will always be open for both of you at the Majestic Oriental Circus”—he smiled ruefully, gazing at the rubble that surrounded us—“or whatever is left of it.”', '“I promised I would let no harm come to the circus,” I said, turning my eyes to the ground. “I failed to keep my promise.”', '“Say no more of it!” he said.', '“If I may ask for one more favor—?” I hesitated.', '“Of course, my man.”', '“I left my old mother in the city in the east where you took me in. We only had each other in the world, but once I was signed on to the circus I did not even wait to go home and take my leave of her. I was young and thoughtless then—a wayward son who only worried and disappointed her. I imagined I would come back soon and give her a big surprise, but the circus kept traveling; I did not even notice how two years went by. Now that I know that I won’t see my mother for a long time—”', '“I will look her up when I return to the city in the east, tell her you are alive, and remind her that her son is loyal and brave, if not always the most practical,” Johuree said. “And if there is any way I can help your mother, I will do my best.”', '“Thank you, Johuree saab,” I replied, overwhelmed. “There is nothing more I desire from the world.”', 'And that was how we walked into our exile—man and jinni, never master and slave but equals in friendship and love. I was no longer a free man, and I don’t know if I had ever been, but if I must pick a master for half—no, ', '—of my remaining life, I know there would have been no better choice than Shehzad Marid. For that day and the rest of my foreshortened mortal existence, I would follow his footsteps through darkness and light, and that would suffice.', 'Text copyright © 2019 by Mimi Mondal', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by Kashmira Sarode']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Circus Girl, The Hunter, and Mirror Boy'], 'Author': ['JY Yang'], 'Body': ['As an orphaned sixteen-year-old, Lynette was haunted by the ghost of Mirror Boy, the drowned child who replaced her reflection. Ten years later, she’s built herself a new life, but all that is threatened when Mirror Boy returns, warning of danger. A hunter has come for both of them, and unless Lynette can figure out what’s going on, they will both perish.', '\\xa0', 'THE CIRCUS GIRL', 'I was twenty-six when I started seeing Mirror Boy again. He showed up without warning on a Monday, as I stood over the sink scrubbing sleep from my eyes and stale whiskey from my mouth. It’s one of my favorite simple pleasures: the cold metallic tang of water, the clean bitter smell of soap. I straightened up for my towel, and there was his ugly mug in the mirror instead of mine. I dropped the towel. “Fuck!”', 'Mirror Boy had not changed in a decade. He was still gaunt and hollow-eyed and in bad need of a haircut. Patches of discoloration bloomed under the brown of his skin. “Hello, Lynette,” he whispered in his crushed-paper voice.', '“No,” I said, and walked right out of the bathroom, my face still dripping wet.', '“Did something happen?” asked my roommate, Shane, as I stomped into the kitchen, wiping myself dry on the cotton of my nightgown sleeve. “I heard you shouting.” She stood unwashed and uncombed over the counter, a ladle in one hand and curious concern etched on her thin features. Coffee sub boiled on the stove and the smell of fried egg lingered.', '“I cut myself shaving,” I said. In my chest my heartbeat with the rhythm of a rail carriage, passing by.', '“Ooooookay,” she said, and went back to spooning bean goop onto plates. Shane was an angel, used to the oceanic swing of my moods. She put up with far too much from me.', 'A dresser cabinet stood by the main door, marking the transition between the kitchen and living areas. Its top was choked with detritus: keyholders, loose coins, half-curdled tins of lip balm. On it sat an oval mirror, framed by a mosaic of recycled bottle glass. I went up to it, not straight on, but cautiously and sideways—as though flanking an enemy—and leaned until it caught my reflection. I prayed it would show my untamable curls and the eyebags I knew and loathed.', '“I need to talk to you,” Mirror Boy said.', '“Fuck off,” I said, to which Shane went, “Uh, what?”', '“Nothing.” I shuffled away from the mirror and flounced down next to the dining table, trying not to breathe too harshly. After ten years spread over the tumult of late adolescence and early adulthood, I had thoroughly convinced myself that my year with Mirror Boy was all made up, an artifact of a traumatized mind. A coping mechanism. But I was better now. The broken girl I used to be had grown up into a functional adult. Why had he come back?', 'The boiling kettle whistled as Shane thumped breakfast in front of me, gelatinous and greasy. She poured the steaming sub into two oversized enamel mugs. “Here,” she said.\\xa0 “You look like you could use an extra helping.”', 'We ate. Or at least, Shane ate, while I mixed bean and egg into a brownish slurry on my plate. All was quiet except for the chittering of the newsprinter, spooling its thin scroll onto the dining table. When it stopped, Shane tore off the printout and scanned its fuss-less, tiny text. “Great squid. There’s been another murder.”', '“Murder?” I said, not really processing the words.', '“Yes. In Darlingfort. Probably that same serial killer that’s been going around.” She turned the chit towards me. “Here, look. Seem like anyone you know?”', 'I squinted at the victim’s picture, monochrome and pixelated, only slightly larger than a toenail. It looked vaguely like a man, possibly brown-haired, maybe thirty, probably white. I shrugged.', 'Shane’s expression softened. “You used to live in Darlingfort, didn’t you?”', '“That was a long time back.” When I used to be a circus girl. When I last had Mirror Boy as my reflection. I shifted uneasily in my chair. The glare of the mirror on the dresser had a weight to it, as though the kid was trying to claw his way out. “Listen, I’d better get going.”', '“What, to work?” Shane looked at the kitchen clock. “Is the salon even open?”', '“Yeah,” I mumbled, pushing my chair back.', '“You haven’t eaten anything.”', '“I’m not hungry.”', 'Shane’s worry peaked. “Hey. Is something wrong?”', '“I’m fine,” I said. It was a lie, and it sounded like a lie.', 'I had to stand by the dresser while I put on my boots. “Why are you avoiding me?” Mirror Boy asked from his corner. “You know I’m here.”', '“Shut up,” I hissed, soft enough to keep it from Shane. “Shut up shut up shut up.”', 'It was clear outside, the air as crisp as winters ever get anymore. A soft breeze teased hair and fabrics. I took the midlevel network, high enough above the water the reflections wouldn’t bother me. Back in Darlingfort the canals were sludge, so I never had this problem.', 'Back in Darlingfort, my relationship with Mirror Boy was different.', 'Once upon a time I was a circus girl, just like my mother. Once upon a time I had an apple-cheeked face and an easy, gap-toothed smile. Once upon a time I used to throw knives and juggle and spin fire.', 'Then my mother died when I was fourteen, and I was like a dinghy cast out into an icy ocean. The other women in the circus tried to protect me as much as they could, but I eventually found out what people were willing to do to young girls when they no longer had the protection of a lion tamer.', 'There was an escape artist, Alfous: almost forty, with a slow-growing belly and a grease-slicked moustache. He tried to hold himself up as a gentleman around me, but I tried not to be around him at all. Until one day the desire burst from him like a swollen river, turbulent and inescapable. He chased me down in the damp of night when the others had gone out to get drunk, and pinned me against the knifeboard.', 'But I was stronger than I looked, and I kicked and screamed and cracked a cheekbone with my heel. So he clubbed me over the head, slapped me in chains, and threw me in the water tank. I woke with my lungs burning and a wall of green murk crushing me. I thought I was going to die, until I saw that there was a boy in the water. He looked my age, with dark eyes and dark hair and skin yellow as the moon. “You can do it,” he said. I didn’t know him, but seeing I wasn’t alone calmed my panic. It was then I found out how far I could bend my elbows, and how easy it was, with my thin wrists, to slip from the vise of the chains. \\xa0I got my hands free, I got out of the tank, and I survived.', 'I survived, and a week later Alfous mysteriously disappeared. No notes left behind, nor any evidence. The rumor around the circus was that he’d been sent to feed Kraken, hungry in the sludgy deep. If anyone suspected the scrawny girl with the purpling across her forehead might have been involved, they said nothing. I volunteered to be the new escape artist, because it turns out I had a natural talent for it. I was sixteen.', 'Anyway, that’s how I met Mirror Boy. When I climbed out of that tank, furious and dripping and bruised in the head, I found that my reflection had disappeared entirely. In its place was the boy who had been in the water with me. Every mirror or glass pane I looked at was graced by his presence, narrow and morose and slightly misshapen. I bled from the palms stealing a shard of factory window for my room, and in that sacred space where no one else was allowed—or no one else dared to go—I spent hours with Mirror Boy. I would sit by the cold glass in the afternoons, in between rehearsals and the start of the night’s performances, and I would let spill all the petty grievances of the day. Who had looked at me the wrong way, who had wounded me with cutting words. Mirror Boy never said much. He listened and told me I was right, or that he agreed with me. And I needed that. As time went on I started talking about my hopes for the future, about how I wanted to leave the circus and leave Darlingfort before it broke me like it broke everyone else. And he would just smile and nod and say he believed I could do it.', 'Some days, I missed knowing what my face looked like. Some days, I was glad I didn’t have to.', 'But I got older, and I got out of the circus. Escaping was my forte, after all, and I found I could bend my mind and will as easily as I could my body. People were willing to pay a lot of money to spend nights with me. I saved that money and used it to find a new and better place to live. To buy a new name and history. I got out of Darlingfort. Slowly—or perhaps all at once, I don’t remember anymore— Mirror Boy left me. I got my reflection back. I became a whole person again.', 'Until now.', 'The salon wasn’t open, and it wouldn’t be open until eleven. On the edge of posh Helbride, it was party to a stream of older women, powdered and primped, who delicately sashayed in from rooflevel with all the confidence I wished I was born with. They came to get their hair done and their faces done and their nails done while they filled the air with stories of their expensive vacations and expensive heliships and expensive children. They had names and, arguably, personalities, and I recognized most of the regulars by sight, but I could not tell them apart. As a lowly beauty technician, I hadn’t been given the salon keys, but the toilets in the building weren’t locked. They were fancy and empty, appointed in gilt and upholstery and soft underlighting.', 'Mirror Boy was waiting for me there, pacing between columns of dark marble in the looking-glass toilet, the one that had a copy of him and didn’t have a copy of me. “I want my reflection back,” I told him.', 'It wasn’t that I didn’t want to see him. Honestly, I’d missed him, and I hadn’t realized how much until now. His familiar shape and hunch sent ambient warmth through odd corners of my chest. At one point in my life, his existence—just for me, and me alone—had brought great comfort. But the truth was, I no longer needed him. And I didn’t want to go back to being that child who did.', 'Mirror Boy glanced sideways at me and continued pacing. “It’s not important.”', '“Ex', ' me,” I said. “I think it’s fucking important.”', '“No,” he said. “You’re in danger.”', 'He looked a little different from what I remembered. He was skittish, fingers twisting over knuckles, shoulders tight and drawn. Like a prey animal. It gave me pause, because I’d never seen him this tense before. And he was so young. O Formless Deep, he was so young. “What kind of danger?”', '“There’s a man, a hunter. He’s killed all of my refuges. You’re the last one.”', '“I don’t understand.”', 'He stopped pacing and stared, eyes intense and frightened. “Those murders in Darlingfort. He killed them all. They died the same way, slit by the same knife.”', 'He was right about that, at least according to the news. The weapon link was how the police knew they had a serial killer on their hands. But they couldn’t figure out his MO, his motivations. All seven victims were of different ages, different genders, and different backgrounds. They didn’t know one another. Nothing linked them except that they all lived in Darlingfort, in coffin-rooms smaller than a whale’s heart. So they said the killer was a sadist, picking off random targets in the neighborhood because they were poor and nobody cared.', '“You’re the last of my refuges,” Mirror Boy repeated. “When the hunter kills you, I’ll be dead too.”', '“What does that mean? Are you tied to me? Are you like some kind of cancer?” It was the easiest comparison in reach, plucking down the name of Mother’s disease.', '“Yes. A cancer. That’s a good way of putting it.” Mirror Boy rubbed his bony hands together. “I’m a cancer. You were . . . my first. Site of metastasis, I mean.”', 'A shiver passed through me at the way he said it. “I’m trying to understand. Who is this man? Why is he coming after you?”', '“I’m unnatural,” Mirror Boy said. “I’m dangerous.”', '“You weren’t dangerous to me,” I said cautiously. Did this unnamed killer know something I didn’t? Mirror Boy did nothing to me except take my reflection, which I cared nothing for at that point in time. And then he gave it back. “It’s because you’re a spirit, isn’t it?”', 'Some people have problems with spirits; they can’t accept they’re part of the world we live in now. It’s mostly a particular sort of people, because when you’re poor and desperate, sometimes spirits are the only ones who can help you. Or will help you, for that matter.', 'I’ve never been afraid of spirits. My mother, when she was alive, used to put me on her knee and tell me that my father was one. A boy with lips like coral and skin like ice, who smelled of ocean and evanesced from her bed in the light of the next morning, never to be seen again. I never found out if she’d just made it up: she didn’t like it when I asked around the circus. After she died I took her story and folded it into the fiber of my being, like all the half-truths I had assimilated over the years. I’m good at taking stories at face value.', '“Did you choose me because my father was a spirit?” I asked Mirror Boy.', '“It doesn’t matter now,” he said. “The man who hunts me has found you. You have to run. He’ll kill you.”', 'I thought of Alfous’s hot breath on my neck. “Run, how?” And where could I run to? Back to Darlingfort, where everyone else had died? I didn’t want to run. I wanted to fight. “There’s got to be something I can do.”', 'Mirror Boy pushed the flat of his palms against the barrier of the glass. “You have to run. Run and hide, the way you did when you left the circus. Become someone else so he can’t find you again. He won’t stop, and you can’t stop him, and you can’t get rid of me.”', '“I got rid of you once,” I said, bristling at this litany of negatives.', 'He looked sad. “But you didn’t.”', 'I wasn’t planning to leave this life that I’d built purely on some intangible warning from a boy who was half a dream. I liked what I had now: the mindless, fuss-free job; a roommate who was reasonably clean and had no drunk boyfriends to bring over; the little pockets of weird I’d found in the neighborhood, places where I didn’t feel quite out of place. For the first time in my life I could see myself continuing down this path towards the future, gray in my hair, a box flat to call a home, a collection of books, half a dozen cats. A tidy and quiet picture that brought me little jolts of pleasure when I thought of it.', 'At nine-thirty I went up to the salon, passing a man in a gray leather jacket smoking in one of the turrets, tossing something pear-shaped up and down in one hand. I frowned, because it was a no-smoking building and whatever he had rolled smelled vile, but I said nothing, because I avoid talking to strange men when I can. His face, hidden in shadow, was turned away from me.', 'Our manager, Jinnie, was already in, sprawled in the receptionist’s chair with a beat-up book. Our shifts started at ten, but she always arrived ahead of time to unlock the doors. She looked surprised to see me. “Well, someone’s early.”', 'I put on my most harried face. “Jinnie, I’m sorry but I’ve got to beg off for today. I know it’s late notice, but something’s come up that I’ve really got to take care of.”', 'Jinnie’s expression slid from suspicion to displeasure at a documentable speed. “You know I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t serious,” I said.', 'She flipped through the bookings chart. “I suppose Sheela can cover for you,” she said, with enough weight on each word to let me know this was a favor she intended to call in later.', '“Thanks, Jinnie. I owe you. Sorry again.”', 'I went down to the waterlevel to see if I could flag a gondola at this hour. There happened to be one moored right in front of the building, with a boatman who looked about fourteen. “How much to Hogskar?” I asked. He returned a number that was extortionate, but I wanted some time to think, so I paid it and climbed in.', 'The water smelled clean. Our gondola slid between the long shadows of buildings, snake-smooth and steady. Here I could see almost all the way to groundlevel: the old shop fronts and their big glass windows rippling in the boat-wake; caressing fingers of kelp; the small dark shoals of fish. The water’s surface was too disturbed to show me Mirror Boy, but it was calming nonetheless.', 'As I straightened up I happened to catch a glimpse over my shoulder, and my heart dropped, a sudden lurch. I thought I’d seen the man in the gray jacket behind us in a second boat.', 'I didn’t dare turn around. “Are we being followed?” I asked the boatman.', 'He looked puzzled. “No, ma’am.”', 'Maybe I had just imagined it. Too nervous to check again, I settled for watching the white faces of buildings glide past. Windows polished as silver posted distortions of the gondola over their glass-warp. There I was, hands clasped over my lap, with Mirror Boy by my side.', 'I startled and turned on instinct. Of course Mirror Boy wasn’t there. Of course I was alone on the ramshackle passenger bench of the gondola. I pulled my coat tighter around myself. We were too far away to talk, in any case.', 'I remembered now. This was how I lost him. First I started seeing both our images together: intermittently, then all the time. Later it started being just me sometimes, with a yawning emptiness where he was supposed to be. There then came a point where he stopped appearing for good, but by that time I was aggressively hunting for a lease and a fifty-six-hour workweek, and didn’t have the space to find out where he went.', 'I thought of the late afternoons spent laid out on my bed—an old gym mat taped to the floor—with him curled naked by my side, a weightless, ephemeral comma. There, but not there. I’d touch myself while he hovered over me in the reflection, imagining it was his fingers I felt sliding over my flesh. Later I filched a dildo from an acrobat’s room and watched him in the gloss of my stolen window as he matched the thrust of his hips with my movements. With my head turned to one side, I could imagine that the translucent figures I saw, rapturous in their copulation, reflected the reality I was in.', 'The gondola slowed at a cross-junction and stopped for the lights. I leaned over the boat’s edge as the water calmed and Mirror Boy came into focus. “I wanted you to be real,” I told him.', '“I know.”', 'I brushed my fingers against his cheek, and his face wavered and broke apart in the ripples. When I sat back I realized the boatman was staring at me. “You sure you alright?”', '“Yeah,” I said, not looking him in the eye. I stared at the chipped corner of a building instead, spotty with water damage. My cheeks burned with a mixture of embarrassment and anxiety.', '\\xa0', 'Hogskar was home to one of the pockets of weird I’d curated. I directed the boatman to a flat-roofed apartment block, where a couple of floors above the water lived a witch who ran a manabonanza out of her home. As the gondola bumped against the barnacle crust along the walls, I thanked him and climbed the stairs through something that used to be a window and was now a front door.', 'This building, like mine, used to have a functional elevator nestled in the winding central stairwell, and it lay drowned at ground level. As I peered into its bronze cage and its flooded depths, a warning prickle ghosted over the back of my neck.', '“Be careful,” Mirror Boy said.', 'I ran up a flight of steps on instinct. Crouched in the cover between windows, I leaned until I could just see outside.', 'The man in the gray jacket sat in a slim boat with an outboard motor, parked against the border of masonry across the canal. I watched as he fished something out of his pocket, lit it, and put it in his mouth. From this distance he looked startlingly like Mirror Boy, all grown up, with a ragged beard and hair that had last seen scissors years ago.', 'Fuck. I went back to the rusted bars of the elevator cage. The dark surface of the water was now a floor away. “Who is he?” I demanded of the distant, floating spirit.', 'Mirror Boy just looked sadly at me.', 'Now all fluttery with adrenaline, I loped upstairs and pressed the buzzer under bunting that read, in faded red, CHRISSAS MANABONANZA. Bundles of shells and fishbone and cartilage festooned the doorway with great cheer, and the protective beak of a colossal squid hung over the premises. A pair of heartbeats passed before Chrissa’s voice crackled over the intercom. “We’re closed, come back at three!”', '“It’s Lynette.”', '“Circus Girl! Hey! What are you doing? Don’t you have work? Just a mo.”', 'I imagined Chrissa tumbling off whatever surface she had perched on and clattering through the layers of her house and shop. The door flew open to her wide-eyed smile and stream of chatter. “You’re just in time. I’m working on something new, it’s so great, you’re going to love it.” She clicked off the multiple locks across the folding aluminum gate. “It’s like, a clockwork heart, and I think I’ve almost got the formulation right this time.”', '“Chrissa,” I said. “Chrissa, I need your help.”', '“Oh. That sounds serious. Come on in.”', 'The moment I crossed the threshold an alarm sounded: a single, shrill, vibrating note. I froze. That sound meant ', ', it meant ', ', it meant ', '“Shit,” Chrissa said. “What the hell?” She grabbed me by the arm and stiffly pushed me into an alcove by the door, cluttered with shoeboxes and the mummified carcasses of old umbrellas. “Did you get infected?”', 'The alarm continued its devouring scream. Chrissa tiptoed and thumbed off its controls, fixed under the fuse box. “Sorry. It’s a recycled school bell—it’s pretty fucking loud.” She turned back to me. “What’s going on? Did you get haunted?”', 'I leaned against the cold ledge of the alcove’s hatch, lined with red brick. “I don’t know. It’s worse than that, I think.”', 'Chrissa clicked her tongue. “Okay. Hang tight. Let me get my stuff.”', 'I stood in the dark of the alcove, inhaling layers of dust into a chest already tight with emotion. Chrissa hummed as she rifled through overflowing cabinets, her straw-bright hair drawn into a high, messy bun. She came back with a lacquered box and an armful of clear plastic drinking glasses. “Here,” she said, leaning across the hatch, “give me some fluid. Spit, blood, whatever.” She handed me a dusty shot glass.', 'I spit several times while she set up, decanting squid-ink tinctures into the glasses, a rainbow of eldritch chemistry. “Thank you,” she said, taking the shot glass from me. She dipped a clutch of cocktail sticks into the spit, then dropped one into each glass.', '“Hmm,” she said, as the tinctures turned color, effervesced, or remained inert. “Okay. It looks like you’ve got a wraith. That’s . . . not great. When did you pick it up?”', 'So that’s how I learned Mirror Boy had a classification, a precedence, an observed set of characteristics. “Ten years ago. I was sixteen. But he left. He’s just only come back now.”', '“Ten years? No, that means the wraith didn’t leave, it just went dormant. I’ve heard that it happens. That’s probably why the wards didn’t pick it up before.” She pushed off the alcove hatch. “Anyway, you’re not at end stage yet, and wraiths aren’t super-infectious. I might be able to contain it. We’ll see. The important part is, you’re still ', '. Come on.”', '“Chrissa,” I said, “the wraith’s not the problem.”', 'She paused. “Oh?”', '“There’s a murderer after me. I think he’s downstairs, waiting across the canal.”', '“A ', '?”', '“He’s killed all of Mirror Boy’s— my wraith’s other refuges. I don’t know what that means, but there’s been a string of murders in Darlingfort—”', '“Hang on a minute. Describe this guy. You said he’s downstairs?”', '“I think it’s him. He’s about my height, skinny, stringy brown hair down to here. This gross, patchy beard . . .”', 'Chrissa’s eyes were slits. “Gray leather jacket?”', '“That’s him. You know him?”', '“Shit.” She blew air between her lips and rolled her eyes. “Yeah, he came to get his scry adjusted. Fucksquid, I didn’t know he was after you.”', '“He’s killed seven people,” I exclaimed. “Why did you help him?”', '“Honey. Do you ', ' what wraiths do? You— wait.” She blew out a breath as a modicum of understanding hit. “You don’t want to get rid of this wraith, do you?”', 'I couldn’t say yes. I couldn’t say no. I said, instead: “I want to know what’s going on. And I want this creep to stop following me.”', 'Chrissa narrowed her eyes again. “How would you describe your relationship with this wraith?”', 'This time, I really hesitated. “Intimate.” As Chrissa’s eyebrows shot upwards I said, “I was sixteen! He was a boy, I was a girl, I—”', '“Did you love him?”', '“No! I don’t know. Look, it’s been ten years. I just don’t want to die like the others. Please, there’s got to be something we can do.”', '“Honey . . .” She rubbed my arm apologetically. “Come on. Let’s see what we’ve got on our hands.”', 'With a bucket of squid ink, wet and pungent, Chrissa inscribed a charm circle on the floor, a standing mirror at its heart. As she worked, she explained: “Wraiths are a bit weird. They’re in between, not fully spirits, but more than raw energy. They’re sort of, leftover life-force that goes hunting for hosts. Parasites, basically.” She straightened up and went to put the ink bucket away. “The problem with wraiths is that A, they take over their hosts and do crazy shit, and B, they can also jump hosts. So they spread. There are hunters who specialize in taking them out before they become a real problem. The more hosts, the harder to kill.”', '“You said they’re not infectious.”', '“I said they’re not ', '-infectious. There are conditions for becoming a host.” She beckoned at me to step into the circle. “Come on. I want to see this mirror boy of yours.”', 'I looked at the lines and glyphs spread across the floor. “Is it going to hurt him? I don’t want to hurt him.”', '“Oh, ', '.” Chrissa shook her head. “It won’t hurt him. It’s for ', ' to see him and talk to him. If he wants to talk.”', 'I gingerly tiptoed into the circle, careful not to disturb the still-wet lines. Mirror Boy stood in front of me, fully clad in a shabby red t-shirt and jeans. I’d never seen him like this, and it sent a trill of sadness and betrayal through me.', '“I’m sorry,” he said. He was just a child, scuffing the toe of one beat-up shoe against the heel of the other.', '“Why didn’t you tell me any of this?”', '“I’m sorry,” he repeated.', 'Chrissa knelt and chanted softly over the charm circle, invoking Kraken, invoking Leviathan. “Neither spine nor ribcage, neither collarbones nor hips, the eyes that see in the watery dark, the mouths that open in the deep.” Her handiwork slid from glistening black to iridescent silver, and the lines sang as they came to life, each circular glyph ringing a different note. The chorus of bell tones raised my flesh in tingling waves.', '“Alright,” Chrissa said, matter-of-factly. She stood and struck gray dust from her hands as the charm circle hummed. “Let’s see what we got.”', 'She stepped in, looked into the mirror, and melted. “Oh, honey. Look at him. He’s just a ', '.”', '“Yeah,” I said, mouth dry. He was a baby. I’d been a baby back then, too. Neither of us knew what we were doing, flailing through this world.', 'Chrissa and her marshmallow heart were already gone. I should have known this would happen. Her voice was bright and airy like she was talking to a small, soft animal. “Hello. What’s your name?”', '“I don’t have one.” He looked to me for reassurance. “She calls me Mirror Boy.”', '“I want to know about you. Tell me about yourself.”', 'Mirror Boy stared blankly. Undaunted, Chrissa asked in the singsong manner she reserved for young children, “How would you describe yourself?”', '“I am what I am,” he said. “I live through others. I’ve had eight different hosts. Lynette was my first, a long time ago. And then she asked me to leave, so I found others. I don’t think she remembers this.”', '“I remember,” I said, stung by his accusation. “And I never asked you to leave.”', 'Chrissa quietly patted my hand, as if to say, ', '. “Tell me about your other hosts. How come you have so many?”', '“I found pathways to other people. But they didn’t always want me around. So I left them too.”', '“Seven other hosts over ten years?”', 'He nodded. “The shortest time I spent with one was three days. But—” he hitched his shoulders up and drew in a shaky breath like he needed air— “the hunter killed her too. Why? She didn’t know who I was. She thought I was a bad dream.”', '“Hunters have to be thorough,” Chrissa said. I choked audibly at that, and she explained, “It’s like an illness. You have to get rid of everything that’s infected.”', '“Like an extermination,” I said tonelessly. I wanted to vomit.', 'Chrissa’s lips pursed. She looked more upset than I ever remembered, and that helped with nothing. She turned back to Mirror Boy as I blinked back burning in my eyes. “How about the host you were with the longest.”', '“My last host,” he said. I noticed how much more tired he looked.\\xa0 “Her name was Nur Elisha. She lived alone in Darlingfort. I was with her for seven years. She thought I was her long-lost grandson.”', 'I swallowed. Words could not describe the ugly feelings welling up in me now. “Did the hunter kill her too?”', '“He killed her first. And found the others, one by one. Every one I fled to, he killed.”', 'Nur Elisha, Nur Elisha. I replayed the name in my head, trying to tease out if and when I saw her in the news. But an elderly woman dying alone in the sewer slums wasn’t important. And wouldn’t be until the third or fourth person killed the same way.', '“I’m going to ask you a question. Please answer it honestly.” Chrissa’s manner towards Mirror Boy was still gentle as a shepherd’s, but I’d never seen her this somber, and that frightened me more than anything else. I was standing chest-high in a sea of uncertainty. It was a sick old feeling. It was a familiar old feeling. “Why didn’t you take any of your hosts over?”', '“Because I didn’t want to,” he said. “I know I’m ', ' to. I can feel that call. But I—” He stopped, struggling for words. He had never been the most talkative, my Mirror Boy. “I just wanted to watch. What would I do with their lives?”', '“What, indeed,” Chrissa muttered to herself. To Mirror Boy she asked: “Do you know who your hunter is?”', '“No.”', '“Hmm.” Chrissa had gone uncharacteristically quiet. She told me, “You stay right here,” and vanished into the upper loft.', 'With Chrissa gone, Mirror Boy leaned as far as the glass would allow him and hissed: “She ', ' help us. Nobody can break what links us. Either you run, or—” He exhaled, and the glass went misty on the inside.', '“Or what?”', '“Or she finds a way to kill me without touching you.”', '“No.”', '“It’s the only way—”', ' I slapped my hand against the glass and he flinched back from it. “Stop saying these things. I don’t want you dead. And I never asked you to leave. Why would you say that?”', 'He moved away from the glass. “You didn’t have to say it. I could tell. You were trying to build a life that had no space for me in it. You wanted a normal life. So I let you be normal.”', '“That’s not true,” I insisted. I had been maybe a bit relieved to get my reflection back—to know that it would be my face I saw when I looked in a mirror—but I wasn’t ', '. It was just—it was more ', '. Because then I didn’t have to worry about explaining him to other people. Or the fact that I couldn’t see to put on lip gloss. It was just slightly easier.', 'But I’d rather have had him. I believed that.', '“There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be normal,” Mirror Boy said.', 'Chrissa came back downstairs, waving a small velvet box that probably safekept someone’s wedding ring in its previous life. “Luckily for us,” she said, “our hunter-murderer is a bit of a dumbass. I’m guessing an amateur. I asked him for a bunch of things as payment for fixing his scry, including a lock of hair.” She tapped the ring box. “Pro tip: Never give a witch anything that used to be part of you. No matter what the reason.”', '“What are you going to do?” I asked. I imagined the curses she could lay upon him on my behalf. She could solve all our problems instantly.', 'But of course Chrissa wasn’t that kind of witch. “I’m going to find out who he is.”', 'Her desk yielded a sliver of workspace and she got busy, tuning us out of her consciousness. I folded myself to the floor and leaned my head against the cool glass. I wasn’t sure what time it was anymore. I thought: ', 'I closed my eyes. Mirror Boy began to talk. “At the start, I was going to take you over,” he said. “It’s true that is the nature of wraiths. But you, you wanted to live so badly. You burned with so much desire that it frightened me. I didn’t think I could put out that flame. So I stayed and I watched you. And over time I realized I didn’t have to do what my nature demanded of me. So I didn’t.”', '“You’re not like the other wraiths,” I whispered.', '“I suppose I’m not.”', '“What do we really know about wraiths, anyway?” Chrissa said. She was grinding some kind of rock into fine powder in a tiny handheld mortar. “Jack shit. All our current spiritual knowledge is like, a grand total of twenty years old. We make it up as we go along. I bet that in ten years, Mirror Boy, you’re going to be the case study people cite when talking about wraiths.”', 'I thought about life ten years in the future and a blanket of exhaustion fell over me. I still had the gauntlet of the next ten days to go through. The next ten hours.', 'Mirror Boy leaned against me, shoulder to shoulder, the glass a thin and unbreakable barrier between our worlds. “Are you happy?” he whispered. “Is this the life that you wanted?”', '“Heavy questions, kid,” Chrissa warned from her perch.', 'I didn’t know how to answer him. “It’s not a bad life,” I said. “It’s a bit dull. But it’s my life.”', '“It sounds nice,” he said, and he sounded like he meant it more than I did.', 'I looked up at Chrissa, framed by the stacks of her grimoires, a figure of pure concentration, and was struck by envy, bone-deep. Chrissa looked like someone who was exactly where she was meant to be. Here was a person who hadn’t just fallen into the grooves of her life like a yellow coat of autumn leaves, but was growing bright and verdant from deep soil that suited her. And she was just sitting there, filled with innocent purpose, with no idea how lucky she was. I wished I had the same kind of untrammeled joy in my life as Chrissa did. I felt almost guilty I didn’t.', '“I’m a pretender,” I said, knowing Mirror Boy was listening. “When I stop to think about my life I get the sense that I’m just borrowing someone else’s. So I don’t.” I shrugged. It was hard to put these sentiments into words. “Like I have all this stuff in my past I can’t talk about. I don’t know.” The events of the past few hours were finally catching up, like a tidal wave about to smother me. “I’m sorry I snapped when you came back. Because it’s like . . . I was being reminded that I’m only a pretender. Pretending to have this life that isn’t mine.”', '“Your life is your life,” Chrissa said sharply, and when I looked up she was glaring at me over the rims of the bifocals she wore to do near-vision work. “Don’t say shit like that. People deserve to have nice things.”', '“A borrowed life is better than none,” said Mirror Boy.', 'I pressed my fingertips to his against the cool glass and felt a smile pushing through my gloom. “I’m not going to argue with you.”', 'Exhaustion overtook me then, and I must have fallen asleep at some point, because I woke to Chrissa gripping me by the shoulders, her face inches from mine. “Did you ever drown?”', 'I blinked away half-ghosts and dream-fragments. “Yes, once.” I didn’t want to tell her about Alfous, about his cruel fingers or the little red tip of his tongue, or the way the blood bloomed across his neck when I cut it.', '“Was this when you met the kid?”', '“How did you know?”', '“Come have a look.”', 'She sauntered to her desk, where a battle-scarred laptop sat whirring. I didn’t want to leave the safety of the charm circle, so I stayed put. Chrissa pointed to the screen. “I worked out your hunter’s name, and I scrubbed the web for it. Look. There we are. There’s your mirror boy.”', 'The screen was too far for me to read. I tried to swallow my disbelief. “Mirror Boy’s the hunter?”', '“Kraken’s sake, no. Mirror boy drowned ten years ago. Here it is, in the news. The hunter’s his twin. There’s your motivation sorted out. He’s going after his brother’s wraith. I told you: an amateur.”', '“I don’t have an older brother,” Mirror Boy said. He sounded confused. “I don’t remember him.”', '“Of course you don’t. You’re not a spirit. Just loose energy from when someone died before their time, given shape and direction. How do you find your hosts, kid?”', 'Mirror Boy licked his lips. “In the water, on the verge of passing.”', '“There, see? You’re following the path of that boy’s death.”', '“But I’m not him,” Mirror Boy said. “I don’t know him. I’m not—”', '“Doesn’t matter.” Chrissa clicked the laptop shut. “Look, obviously this guy is serious. Amateur hunters like him do it because they’re fanatics. You can’t reason with them. I know this too well.” She sighed and tangled her hands in her hair. “And there’s no known way to separate a wraith from its host. Once you infect a person, it’s permanent. No take-backsies.” She started pacing in a tiny circle, which she only did when she was frustrated. “That’s why hunters kill hosts. It’s cruel, but it’s better than letting the wraith spread, because most wraiths are legit nightmares. I don’t say that lightly. I’ve had to clean up before. When wraiths possess people, they turn into psychopaths. Like flesh-dungeon, cannibal-horror psychopaths.”', '“But he’s not like that,” I said. “You know he’s not like that. He’s not.”', '“I know. He . . . loves you. I think that’s the difference.” She looked between the two of us, helpless. “Honey, I’m sorry. This is out of my depth. I’m out of ideas. I don’t know what to do.”', '“That’s not good enough. We have to do something.” I looked at Mirror Boy, trapped in his bubble of a world. I’d spent the last ten years scraping this life I had together, but he couldn’t leave the glass-bound existence he was chained to. So maybe my life wasn’t perfect, maybe it was dull and not a hundred percent what I would have hoped for. But it was ', '. And it was more than he had. It wasn’t fair. He deserved better. ', ' deserved better.', '“We have to do something,” I repeated.', '\\xa0', 'THE HUNTER', 'Leviathan forgive me. I stand here in Your eternal sight, a sinner beyond redemption, my hands stained as Kraken’s ink and my heart cold and dead as Kraken’s eyes. Ten years ago the greater part of my soul drowned in the water with my brother. It was my fault that those men mistook him for me, and a stain upon my being that I was not there to stop it from happening. But it will be over soon. Tonight, or tomorrow, or sometime this week, I will kill the last of his hosts, and then it will be done. This job will be done, and I can fade away.', 'The girl has corralled herself in the building where the witch lives. I don’t know if they’re friends, but the scry lies heavy and dormant in my hand. Something protects her and hides her from my sight. The knife weighs my belt down, waiting and patient. It has tasted the blood of seven, and it wants more. I detest it. I detest its heft, its hunger. I regret the day I had it forged. But it’s too late. If I stop now, at this one last step I need to end this wraith, then all the death that came before will be for nothing.', 'In the old days this would be easier. You’d dig up the grave, salt the bones, then burn them. But the sea is my brother’s grave, and it has thickened his bones with salt, and no fire shall ever touch them.', 'It was Leviathan who guided me. It was They who sent Bastian to me. Sweet Bastian, with his soft cheeks and honeyed lips. He spoke of the year his reflection showed someone else, dark haired and dark eyed, skin warm as almond husks. He said: “At first, I thought you were him. You look exactly alike.” I told him about my dead twin, the drowned boy, and between our tellings the events that had followed my brother’s death became clear. By then I had spent years in penance, knees pressed to the cold temple floors, hot blood dripping into sacrificial chalices, praying for my sins to be cleansed by the stringent purity of saltwater. For the mercy of Leviathan to pass through me and leave me bleached and bare. That night, I knew that I was beyond the redemption of even the Great Finned One, but They had blessed me still with a chance to atone for the life I had led.', 'From there everything unraveled: the nights combing through the mausoleums of old libraries, the days spent pulling secrets out of witches and priests. And then the knowledge, and then the knife, and then the first of the blood. The old woman who lived alone in a coffin box, among stacks of decaying photographs and the flat faces of mirrors.', 'Until then, I didn’t think I could do it. Until the moment the knife punctured her chest I believed I would fail on the path Leviathan had set me upon. But the old woman died and I was baptized in her blood, reborn as Leviathan’s blade. Great Leviathan, I am Your will and Your flesh in the realm of mortals, doing Your bidding as I may. I stain myself in Your name. I condemn myself so that I may bring peace to Your domain.', 'Yesterday it was Bastian’s turn. The smell of his blood lingers on my collar where his hands touched it, his questing fingers tightening, then losing their grip. I dread the thought of washing my shirt. It’s all I have left of him.', 'The scry comes to life, the coral glowing with bioluminescence. The urchin-spike needle spins. The girl has emerged from her den of safety.', 'Soon it will be over.', 'By the time I park the boat and enter the building, her footsteps are echoing on the steps several floors above me. I take my shoes off. Barefoot and silent, I slip upwards, the knife ready in my hand.', 'The girl comes to a stop at midlevel, leaning by the gangway to the next building. She’s slender and fashionable, an ocean of curls resting on her shoulders. In another time, I might have offered her something else: a drink, a taste of salt. Her shaking hands fumble with a lighter and cigarette. In the end, it’s our vices that will lead to our downfall. I creep up from behind.', 'Soon it will be over.', 'Something creaks. She turns, catches sight of me, and recoils in fear. I spring forward, but she is already fleeing down the gangway into the waiting night.', 'I give chase. The girl shines like a deer in the woods, a memory from the time I was too small to know speech. She vanishes into the shelter of the next building, which exists as a dismal wreck, boarded-up and empty even of squatters. The midlevel floor, formerly a studio or warehouse, challenges me with a maze of metal cabinets, heaving with rotting boxes and bloated white tins.', 'The girl slips between the cabinets, her breathing harsh. I trip over a metal rod jutting between two shelves and land palm-first in the dust. As I scramble to get up I hear a deep crash, then another. A chorus of deadly groans—metallic, ringing. The girl. She’s pushed a shelf over and now they’re all coming down, an army of avenging dominoes.', 'The floor doesn’t hold. Eaten through with mold and termites, it ruptures under the weight of the falling shelves. Wood and metal plunge towards the waiting water, meeting their doom with dull sounds. I barely escape the devouring chasm in time. I watch a whole cabinet tip to its death, its insides spilling like butchered intestines.', 'A skittering sound to my left. It’s the girl, leaping over rubble and ruin. I realize I’ve dropped the knife and it’s nowhere to be found.', 'The girl has it. She’s run to the far end of the room, and the knife glints in a shard of moonlight as she holds it up. I speak to the wraith of my brother who resides in her: “Are you going to do it for me, Vincent?” I ask. “Will you end your own life? End this torment?”', '“I’m not him,” she says, in a voice high and clear as a songbird’s. “I’m not your dead brother. No one is.” She cuts into her palm; blood runs over her wrist and down her elbow. “Look. I bleed red. I’m human.”', 'I shake my head. None of the other hosts bled wraith-black either. Sometimes the literature is wrong. But now the girl has put obstacles between us. She is clever; I have to be careful.', '“Look,” she says. “You seem like a nice man. It doesn’t have to be like this. We could be friends. I want to be your friend. Don’t you want to know your brother?”', 'Her eyes are luminous, the way I remember deer eyes reflected the light.\\xa0 The shape of her legs shows under her shift, and I imagine the warmth between them and the soft places I can sink into. I imagine taking her down by the neck and having her right here, on the dying floorboards of a dying building. I imagine killing her as she comes, my brother’s wraith spilling like black vomit from her lips.', 'A shiver passes through me, and I know at once that this is Kraken’s corruption. Kraken with Its tentacles that turn flesh to temptation and minds to ruin. Kraken who lives to frustrate the will of Leviathan. No. I cannot be fooled. I will not be thwarted.', 'I seize a metal rod from the ground, its end a series of ragged points. The knife is only a tool; anything will work as well. “Don’t try to trick me, you witch.”', 'The girl runs.', 'By Leviathan’s grace I cross the room without falling through. The girl has vanished up the concrete stairwell with roof access, but that’s a mistake. This building is too short to connect to rooflevel, so she’ll be trapped. I burst through the door to find her standing at the roof edge, staring across the blank space of the canal, elbows tight to her waist.', '“There’s nowhere to run,” I say, as the door claps shut behind me. “You might as well give up. It’ll be easier on both of us.”', '“I don’t want to die,” she says.', '“I know. I’m sorry.” And I mean it. She is lovely, and I am truly sorry that she has to die. “But to live, a wraith needs a body to inhabit.”', 'She looks over her shoulder at me. “I know,” she says sadly.', 'Then she spins on her heel, her arm thrown out.

My metal rod clatters to the ground.', 'The girl canters over and pulls the knife from my heart, and the blood it held back spills over my shirt. “Once upon a time, I used to be a circus girl,” she says. “Once upon a time, I used to throw knives and juggle and spin fire.”', 'The girl’s eyes glitter in the moonlight as though they were a distant conflagration. A forest burning. “He’s taken you,” I say. The taste of hot copper fills my mouth.', '“No,” she says. “He’s never taken me. He doesn’t follow his nature. He chose not to. That’s why I decided to save him.” She squats over me. “To live, a wraith needs a body to inhabit. You understand, don’t you?”', 'I do, and yet I do not. The world is fading around me. In this half-twilight my brother stands behind the circus girl. It’s been so long since I’ve seen him, I’ve forgotten what he looks like. He’s so beautiful. We used to be so beautiful. I had forgotten.', 'I flick my gaze back to the circus girl, trying to understand before my time on this watery earth runs out. “You’ll . . . take care of him?”', '“No, hunter,” she says. “He’ll take care of you.” She runs her fingers softly through my hair. “A borrowed life is better than none.”', ' Is that something I used to say?

And sometimes, handling a test run that has turned deadly serious. Mary Robinette Kowal visits an off-stage incident in her ', ' series.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Six thirty in the morning was a brutal time to start work even without a sprained ankle. Ruby Donaldson tried to tell herself that being sore and exhausted was good practice as an astronaut. Limping up to the third floor of the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, she gave thanks that no one else was in the stairwell so she could lean against the metal rail. It was hard enough balancing work and life without people questioning her choices.', 'All she wanted was to do the NBL training run and then collapse in bed, but somehow she’d agreed to another lindy-hop dance rehearsal tonight. It was just hard to disappoint a friend that you’d been dancing in competitions with since before the Meteor struck, and she didn’t have that many pieces of Before left in her life.', 'At least, the benefit of being a doctor was that she could diagnose and treat her own injuries. She didn’t have to risk getting grounded if she admitted to a flight surgeon that she’d twisted her ankle practicing a Charleston Flip. All they would have done was exactly what she did. Ice. Wrap. Analgesic.', 'As she came out on the pool level, the smell of chlorine met Ruby at the door. The massive football field\\xad–sized pool hummed with activity as dozens of divers and suit techs prepped for the run.', 'Wait— There were too many people here.', 'And there were ', ' EVA suits on the bright yellow donning stands by the pool. There should only be two, because her run had been scheduled with just one other astronaut. All she and Eugene were supposed to be doing was a simulated spacewalk to work out the procedure for attaching cameras to the outside of the station.', 'Across the pool, Jason Tsao turned from where he was talking with one of the astronauts who had done a run yesterday and shouldn’t even be at the NBL today. His tie was undone and his cuffs were rolled up past his elbows. She had never seen the test conductor look even marginally rumpled.', 'What the hell was wrong?', 'He beckoned her over with his sheaf of papers. “Ruby, morning. Change of plans, as I’m sure you probably expected.”', 'She had missed something—a message left with her roommate, a briefing update, something—and whatever it was did not look good. She snapped into the sort of focus she felt in the operating room. “What sort of change?”', 'Jason’s shoulders tightened. “Sorry. I assumed you had seen the news.”', '“I— I was out last night.” She had been dancing as if Before still existed.', 'He took a slow breath. “No one is dead. A ship returning from the moon had a retrorocket misfire while docking with ', ' yesterday evening.”', '“Oh God.” Scores of people worked on the ', 'orbiting platform. People she knew. And Eugene Lindholm, her partner for today’s run—his wife would have been on the lunar rocket. Ruby played bridge with Myrtle and Eugene. She turned, looking for the tall black man among the people working by the pool. He was at the stainless steel bench, running through his checklist with tight, controlled motions. No one was dead, but if the Meteor had taught the world anything, death wasn’t the worst thing that could happen to someone. “How bad?”', 'Jason glanced up as if he could see past the tall roof of the NBL to the space station. “The pilot of the lunar rocket could see coming in that they had a problem, so ', '’s hangar crew evacuated and the rocket’s hull is intact. We’re incredibly lucky.”', 'Ruby wiped her hand over her face, still stunned. They needed the station as a transfer point to get people off Earth. Damage to it would throw the space program back years. At least the four EVA suits made sense now. “And so we’re working on coming up with a repair procedure today?”', 'Shaking his head, Jason handed her the paperwork for the day’s run, which was the only thing that seemed normal. “We’re using the NBL to figure out the rescue and recovery plan. The impact warped the airlock and coupling mechanism, so the rocket is locked to the station and the airlock is jammed. We’ve got a team up on the station working on getting it open but want all possible solutions, because the people on the lunar rocket don’t have EVA suits.”', 'Ruby sucked in a breath that suddenly felt like a luxury. She knew the margins on consumables for the moon run. They’d been trapped since yesterday evening, so had already been on the ship longer than the IAC budgeted for, even with redundancies. “How much air and—”', '“We have sixteen hours to figure out how to get them out.”', '\\xa0', 'The Lower Torso Assembly, aka space pants, lay on a cloth pad, ready for her. Astronauts did not, in fact, put their pants on like everyone else. It took two trained professionals and an astronaut wiggling across the floor to squirm into the LTA’s tight legs. Around the pool, three other astronauts were getting ready to do the same awkward floor dance. Eugene sat on the other side of the donning stand from her, his brown skin ashen above the white mesh of his Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment, but he’d insisted that he was okay to do the run.', 'She’d do right by him and Myrtle. Ruby sat on her rump in her own mesh LCVG, with its lines of tubing wrapping around her body and no modesty. She grabbed the hard aluminum ring at the waist and slid her feet into the top of the legs.', 'And knew she had a problem.', 'A different problem than the fact that a score of her friends and colleagues were trapped in a tin can 254 miles above her. The tacky rubber that lined the suit grabbed hold of the fabric of her cooling garment. Ruby’s ankle twinged with a warning. She evaluated it. A mild sprain. She could work through that. It was swollen, but not enough to make the suit not fit. It would just be…uncomfortable. Ruby shoved her feet into the tight layers of rubber, and pain radiated white lines to her knee, sending flashes across her vision.', 'Ruby stopped, holding the suit and her breath for a moment. All right. The sprain was worse than she thought.', 'At best, it would eat twelve of the sixteen hours to swap her out for another crew member. Almost everything about the EVA suits was customizable and swapped around to fit the crew members who were using them. The tech suit staff must have worked all night to reset the two other suits for this development run. Dev runs were hard enough when mission control had enough time to build a procedure. Today there would be more winging it than anyone would like.', 'And if she couldn’t suit up? Since she was the shortest member of the astronaut corps, they couldn’t just plunk someone else into her suit. If they could have, they would have put in someone other than “the pint-sized Astronette” for this run. She’d been an astronaut for two years, with only one moon trip under her belt. Sure, she’d been top of her class, because at her height being the best had been her only option, but if they could have gotten a ', 'astronaut like Elma York in here, they would have.', 'Heck, the only astronauts they could add on this short a notice had just finished a run yesterday so their suits were already customized. Those two had to be exhausted after six hours fighting suits pressurized to 4.3 psi under thirty feet of water, but Paul Charvet and Serge Broom had shown up with faces as grim and determined as everyone else’s.', 'The suit tech on her right glanced at her. “Everything okay?”', 'This was going to hurt, but once she was in, the simulated spacewalk wouldn’t use her feet. Much. She just had to get into the suit.', '“Yep. Just getting my toes lined up.” Gritting her teeth, Ruby tried to keep her face placid as she worked her foot through the leg of the suit. The swelling in her ankle made it feel as if the rubber bladder was grabbing her deliberately. Flares shot up from the protesting muscles as if warning her to back away. She tried to breathe through the pain, and kept wriggling past the folds of fabric and rubber while the two techs braced the legs.', 'A fishhook seemed to embed itself in between the talus and tibia bones of her ankle and dug in deeper as she worked her foot down through the leg. The moment when her foot popped into the boot at the end made her gasp with relief.', 'She couldn’t speak so she gave a thumbs-up and held out her hands for the men to help hoist her to her feet. Thank God standard procedure meant that they braced her because she wasn’t putting any weight on her right foot until she had to. All she needed to do now was walk five feet, wiggle into the hard torso of the EVA suit where it hung suspended on the donning stand, and that would be the last time she’d have to put significant weight on her ankle until the run was finished.', 'At least that was one good thing about her lindy-hop training—she knew how to smile through pain. Under the best of conditions, you were sore at the end of an NBL run. This was just different pain.', 'It also helped that everyone expected astronauts to grimace as they forced themselves into the hard upper torso assembly. But once inside the HUT assembly, she could let the donning stand support her weight and lean against the frame while the suit techs put the rest of the suit on. It wasn’t that it was comfortable, because the o-ring joints at the shoulders of the suit pushed her arms forward a little and dug into her armpits, but at least the donning stand took her weight.', 'As much as she wanted to tell everyone to hurry, the old aphorism “slow is fast” applied here, too. They wouldn’t help the crew on the station who would have to do the actual spacewalk if they started making mistakes by rushing.', 'They’d done things right this morning, taking the time to do the pre-run briefing so everyone knew what their jobs were. Broadly, their job was to work out safe procedures in the relatively benign environment of a 6.3-million-gallon pool of water so that when her colleagues in orbit went into the lethal environment of space, they didn’t have to take any unnecessary chances.', 'Specifically, she and Eugene were going to see if a life raft was possible while EV3 and 4 attempted a maneuver to see if it was possible to run air and power to the lunar rocket. To buy time. Ultimately, if they couldn’t get the hatch open, the rocket’s crew would still need a life raft to transfer safely inside the station.', 'So Ruby forced herself to relax, conserving energy for the run itself, while the techs checked the cooling system and on so she would have comms in her suit. The helmet followed after that and slid a barrier between her and the world.', 'This was what things would sound like for the folks trapped in the ship. Even without a breach, they’d have their emergency pressure suits on, which would protect them from a vacuum but not the temperature extremes outside the ship. All their communication would be filtered by comms, which were distancing and intimate all at the same time.', 'In her ears, the comforting litany of mission control almost made it sound like people weren’t in danger.', 'And then the litany broke. “We can’t get a good seal on EV1.”', 'Eugene’s voice followed from where he stood behind her on the donning stand. “It’s probably just a gauge.”', '“You know we can’t risk that.”', 'Ruby opened her eyes. There was nothing she could do, strapped to the donning stand, but if they couldn’t seal Eugene’s suit it would take on water in the pool. Myrtle was up there. “Eugene— There will be three of us in the pool. They can add you as soon as they get a good seal.”', 'His breath hissed in her ears, but she could hear his fighter pilot training. He was heartbreakingly calm when he spoke. “Copy.”', 'Jason’s voice joined the mix. “We’ll start the run with EV2, 3, and 4 and add him as soon as you get a good seal.”', 'With Myrtle up there, it had to be killing him to be pulled at this point.', '“Eugene?”', '“Yeah, Ruby.”', '“I’ve got this.”', 'His breath caught for just a second. “Copy. I’ll be with you on comm until they get me in the pool.”', 'As she glanced at the clock on the wall, her stomach twisted. Fourteen hours remaining for the crew on the lunar rocket.', '\\xa0', 'Underwater, everything was blue. The big cylinders that made up the mockup ', ' were punctured with even round holes to allow water to flow through. Cables snarled in ungainly swirls around the outside of the mock space station and the water pushed against Ruby’s suit, creating a resistance that she didn’t experience in space. Around her, support divers floated with bubbles drifting up from them, ready to help her compensate for the drag of water.', 'And she needed help. This was her third attempt to attach a spare expansion module of ', ' to the aft end of the lunar rocket. In theory, with an oxygen pack and a CO', ' scrubber, it would serve as a sort of “life raft” for the crew inside the ship. Assuming she could find a path to get it there without getting snarled in cables.', '“All right, EV2…” Eugene’s voice was steady on the comm, as if he were in the pool with her. “Look for handrail 1175.”', 'She had no idea where handrail 1175 was on the lunar rocket. If she’d stayed in last night, instead of going to the rehearsal, then she would have gotten Jason Tsao’s phone call and been able to prep for the change of plans. Or to at least familiarize herself with the lunar rocket in more detail. Grimacing, Ruby peered around the ship.', '“Can you give me a big picture of where that is?” She hated to ask for help navigating but the distortions from her helmet and the water made reading numbers a little dicey. Myrtle was not going to die because Ruby had gone to a dance practice last night.', '“Oh sorry. We’d need you to go to just aft of the starboard external payload facility.” Eugene’s voice was steady as he guided her in, because he’d done his homework. “Past the grapple fixture, down the gap-spanner…It should be sandwiched between two WIFs.”', 'When she’d started with the IAC, the jargon had been daunting. Now it wasn’t much different from “over the river and through the woods.” She hauled herself forward, looking through the distortion that her helmet caused in the water. Behind her, the tether for the “life raft” trailed through the water.', 'A pair of support divers steadied it to compensate for Eugene’s absence. In the real spacewalk, another astronaut would be back there with tethers to hold it steady while she moved forward. If EV3 and 4 weren’t tied up trying to simulate running air and power to the rocket, they might have helped. But it was on her and a faux EV1.', 'Finally, she found the handrail label sandwiched, as advertised, between two of the sockets that peppered the rocket’s skin. “Got it.” Ruby secured her safety tether, making sure that the black lines on the latch lined up. “EV2’s anchor tether hook is on handrail 1175. Slider locked, black on black.”', 'She secured a local tether as well, trying to stabilize herself in relation to the rocket. Once she was steady, she snapped the crewlock bag onto the handrail so that it was ready for her.', 'The final tether was the long one that trailed back to the life raft. “Transferring life raft tether to handrail 1175.”', '“Suggestion.” Eugene’s voice cut in. “Use the aft starboard stanchion. Otherwise, the tether might trap your safety line when you pull the life raft forward.”', '“Good note.” Ruby kept her voice relaxed as his. She should have spotted that. Carefully, she unhooked the life raft tether from her suit and transferred it to the stanchion. Turning carefully, she worked back along the length of the ship to face the life raft. Pretending that Eugene was in the pool, she said, “Life raft tether secured. New path looks good. Ready to leapfrog the life raft forward.”', '“Copy, EV2. Releasing RET and moving toward you.” He wasn’t. A diver was mimicking his actions in ways that they would never do in a real dev run. But this was the best they could do. The suit techs still couldn’t get a good seal on his suit.', 'Hand over hand, she pulled the bulky rubber toward her, just as if Eugene were really on the other side of it to guide it down the length of the rocket. The action caused her to drift a little away from the handrail, until her tethers stopped her, just as they were designed to do. In space it would be more pronounced. “They might consider two local tethers to control drift.”', '“Good note.” Jason’s voice was calm and cool in her ears. “Thank you, EV2.”', 'As the life raft drifted to her, Ruby felt a flush of triumph. With one stiff glove, she reached out to stop it next to her. “I have the life raft.” With her free hand, she secured a retractable equipment tether to the bracket on the side of the life raft’s grapple mechanism and unspooled the tether to snap it into place on the space ship. On the other side, the diver mimicked her.', '“EV2…We’ll need you to place all the tethers to make sure that the positions are achievable in a suit.” Jason sounded almost apologetic.', '“Copy.” The plan was to place four tethers to stabilize the life raft and then cinch it down to contact the side of the lunar rocket and engage the grapple mechanism. It made sense that they would need someone in an EVA suit, with its limited range of movement, to place all four. Looking down, she couldn’t even see the bottom tether. All things considered, she’d start with the hard one first while she still had some energy. “Working on the nadir tether attachment first.”', 'Ruby released the local tether, leaving her safety tether in place, and worked her way down to the bottom of the handrail. At the bottom end, she tried to snag the tether hook but the body position was bad. She had to twist her arm in ways that the suit really wouldn’t let her. The suits really didn’t want you to raise your arms over your head. Being upside down might work though…Grabbing the handrail, she rotated so that she hung head-down in the water. Better.', 'Kind of. The suits were neutrally buoyant, but inside them, she was dealing with 1-G. As blood pooled in Ruby’s head, she figured that at least her ankle was elevated.', 'Over the comm, Jason said, “Looks like you’re heads-down, we’ll do a check at five minutes and pull you at ten.”', '“Copy.”', 'The life raft had drifted down in the pool so the grapple mechanism was masking the anchor point on the lunar rocket. Maybe she should have done the top tether first. Ruby tried pushing the life raft up in the pool, but the water resistance and gravity pushed down on it. In space, this would be easy, but in the NBL her muscles burned.', '“Five minutes, EV2.”', '“I’m fine.” Standard procedure be damned. Her sinuses were full and her head pounded from being upside down, but she could manage the discomfort. The body position was better for placing the tether, but the tube itself was fighting her in ways that it wouldn’t in space.', 'Ruby was so used to not complaining, because she was short. Because she was a woman. Anything she said would be seen as a failure on her part. But the resistance was an NBLism and not a problem the actual spacewalker would face, and people’s lives were on the line. Ruby sighed as quietly as she could on a live mic. “I could use a diver assist to support the tube.”', 'Like magic, one of the three support divers following her floated up and guided the end of the bag so that it floated in the water more or less the way it would in space. She stretched her arm toward the newly revealed anchor point, fingers aching as she fought the pressurized suit.', '“That’s ten minutes, EV2.”', '“Almost there.” The motion made her rotate a little. Damn it. She should have put the additional local tether in place to control her own motion. Grimacing, she tried to snap the tether hook in place and just missed. It slipped out of her clumsy grasp and floated away from her in the water. She held her curses inside.', '“Divers, set EV2 upright.”', 'Biting down on the inside of her cheek, Ruby tried to relax when the divers gently pulled her back and rotated her upright so the blood could drain from her head. As they did, she slipped inside her suit and suddenly all of her weight was on her feet. Ruby closed her eyes, breathing through her teeth.', '“Anything wrong, Ruby?” Jason Tsao’s voice snapped her eyes open.', '“Nope.” In front of her, the support diver in charge of filming had his camera aimed at her face. Ruby smiled at him, so that everyone in the mission control room would be able to see that she was fine. They wouldn’t pull her out of the pool, not with lives on the line, but they would sure as heck note any struggles for future missions. “Just thinking through next steps. I’m ready to start up again when you are.”', '\\xa0', 'On attempt number four, Ruby had figured out a process that got the tube lined up, but still wrestled with snugging the life raft up against the ship enough to get a good seal. The grapple mechanism had been designed to be activated by pressure from docking. Attempting to exert that pressure manually was…challenging.', 'Biting the inside of her lip, Ruby fumbled with the thick straps while holding on to a handrail with one hand. Her own tethers stabilized her a little, but not enough.', 'Eugene crackled onto the comm. “Do you think an APFR would give you better leverage?”', 'Articulated Portable Foot Restraint. She stopped what she was doing and stared at the ship. The handrail she was using was between two sockets built into the skin of the lunar shuttle. She’d been using the solution as just a navigation point. All she had to do was use one of those two sockets to attach a foot restraint and free both hands.', 'And she’d been avoiding using a foot restraint because she’d been unconsciously avoiding pain. To get her feet into the APFR, she’d have to twist her ankle in and out of the restraint. Normally the MC trusted the astronaut on decisions like that during a dev run, to figure out what worked best for them. Ruby had been screwing things up because she’d gone dancing.', '“Good call.” The silver lining to the number of runs they’d done was that she knew where the nearest APFR was stored. She’d passed by it at least twice during this run, which made it all the worse that she hadn’t thought of it. “Translating back over the river and through the woods.”', '“If you’re reversing course, shouldn’t that be through the woods and over the river?”', '“Pretty sure there are woods on both sides of the river.” Ruby pulled herself hand over hand to the port sensor array, which was, thankfully, within reach of her safety tether. Even so, fighting the water resistance made her arms burn with effort. In the back of her head, time ticked away. “I could have collected this on my previous pass, which would buy some time.”', 'Jason Tsao responded. “Good note, EV2. I’ll pass that up to station.”', 'He didn’t say “if this works” but the question hung in the water with her. Ruby attached a Retractible Equipment Tether to the foot restraint. Once the RET was secure, she pulled the foot restraint off the WIF by turning the collar and depressing the “petals” at the base of the post. The bayonet slid out of the socket. It was a ridiculous thing to feel triumph about, but at the moment she would take even small victories.', 'Turning to reverse course, Ruby swung her body through the water so that her feet trailed behind her \\xa0The water resistance grabbed her feet and seemed to slowly twist her ankle. Ruby locked her jaw and breathed through her nose. This was an acceptable level of pain but the translation back to the work site seemed twice as long. She didn’t have the energy for banter.', 'When she got back to the handrail, she snapped her local tether back into place. “Slider locked, black on black.”', 'Closing her stiff fingers around the foot restraint, she plugged its into the nearest socket. The litany of locking things in place continued. “Collar locked, black on black.” She wrapped her hands round the APFR to make sure it was seated correctly. “Good twist and pull test”', '“Copy EV2.”', 'Ruby retrieved the RET and restowed it. The last thing she needed was to get snarled in something she’d forgotten to put away.', 'Adjusting her tethers to allow her to “stand up” perpendicular to the lunar rocket, Ruby put her feet next to the foot restraint. She slid the toes of her left foot under the restraint and twisted her foot to slide the heel ridge into the restraining slot.', 'Biting the inside of her cheek, she slid her right foot under the restraint and twisted it. It felt as if her boot was filled with broken glass. It wasn’t. She was pretty sure she wasn’t doing permanent damage to the ankle. Slowing down recovery time, yes, but even if it was permanent damage, at the end of the day it just meant she wouldn’t be able to dance.', 'But she’d still be able to play bridge with Myrtle and Eugene.', 'Ruby reached for the tether and yanked on it with both hands. Something in her ankle went ', 'and snapped.', 'A small cry escaped. Ruby bit down hard. She would live, and so would the people on that ship if she had anything to say about it. Grimacing, she hauled on the tether until the tube snuggled up against the mockup station and the grapple clicked into place.', 'Tears streaked across her cheeks, and for once the 1-G was a benefit because the moisture didn’t build up in watery balls over her eyes. Ruby nodded for the camera. “Thanks, Eugene. The answer is APFR. With that, I can pitch back. I can grab the bag. Anchor it. I can maneuver my body and not have to pitch or roll with the handrail. Sorry it took so long to work out.” Her ankle throbbed with each beat of her heart. “What’s next?”', 'She hung in the water, listening to the sound of her own fans. Around her, support divers slowly turned the water with their fins while they all waited. Her ankle consumed the rest of her attention.', 'The line crackled as Jason came back on the line. “Let’s get you out of the pool.”', '“I’m fine to continue.”', '“Thank you, but we’re transmitting this part of the procedure up to ', '. We’ll let Paul and Serge dev the process of getting the tube back to the other end of the ship. It’s comparatively straightforward.”', '“It’s not a problem.”', '“Ruby.” Eugene’s voice cut in. “I’ve played bridge with you. I know your tells.”', 'She opened her mouth, staring at the camera in front of her. “Right. See you topside.”', 'Her support divers swam up around her and pulled her away from the ship. In space, right now, someone on ', 'was suiting up to go out and do this as a real spacewalk, not as a development run in a pool. Or heck, maybe they were all ready to go and had just been waiting for a viable solution.', 'All the mistakes that Ruby had made were ones that the real rescue team wouldn’t have to. The pool was hard. Space would kill you.', 'Ruby let herself go limp in her suit, watching the bubbles of her support divers stream past like flecks of snow. In her ears, the conversation with the other team continued as they kept working to try to mate an umbilical to the lunar rocket. She realized that she had no idea how long she’d been down.', 'When the divers got her attached to the donning stand and the crane hauled her above the pool, Eugene was waiting poolside. He still wore his Snoopy cap, with the comm unit in place so he could stay in the loop. His lower lip had a raw spot as if he’d been biting it constantly while she was under the water.', 'He could hear her if she spoke, but she waited until her suit was depressurized and her suit tech had her helmet off. She flexed her hands against the ache in the joints and met Eugene’s gaze as the tech pulled her Snoopy cap off.', 'Eugene took his own off and stepped forward. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell them to pull you earlier.”', '“That was the right choice.” She shifted her weight to her left foot as her tech released the hard aluminum ring connecting her pants to the suit. “How long do they have?”', '“Six hours.” He glanced across the room at the clock on the wall. “It’s enough.”', 'Ruby nodded and squirmed down, with a tech on either side to catch her. It was standard practice, but Eugene stepping forward, hands out, wasn’t. For the first time since she’d gone under, Ruby put weight on her right foot. Her head was still in the suit and the fiberglass interior seemed to light up like a meteor striking the Earth.', 'Hands caught her and the next thing she knew, she was seated in a chair, still blinking back tears. Swallowing, Ruby shook her head. “I’m fine—GAH!” The sound ripped out of her as the techs tried to pull the spacesuit pants down. Her ankle was so swollen that it caught in the boot.', 'Gripping the side of the chair, she panted until the spots faded from her vision.', 'The nearest suit tech toggled on his mic. “We need medical for EV2.”', 'She winced, but calling a medic was inevitable. “Not urgent. I aggravated a previous injury, that’s all.”', '“Aggravated?” Eugene shook his head. “You’re going to aggravate me if you keep lying.”', '“I’m not— Okay. I am. I’ve likely torn a ligament in my ankle. But y’all are going to pull these goddamn pants off of me because if the medic gets here first, she’s going to try cutting it off.”', 'The tech looked up, appalled. “Oh hell, no.”', '“Right?” Ruby stuck out her hurt leg. “You are Go for removal.”', 'He looked up at Eugene, who grimaced and then nodded. Eugene stepped behind her and braced Ruby with his hands on her shoulders. Putting a hand on either side of the boot, the tech hauled back. Ruby managed not to scream, but if Eugene weren’t bracing her, she probably would have fallen out of the chair.', 'Beneath the mesh of her cooling garment, her ankle was swollen to twice the size it should be. Eugene whistled. “Aggravated a previous injury?”', '“Sprained it last night.” Her entire leg was pulsing in hot and cold waves around the burning core of her ankle. It was past a sprain now, but Ruby tried to keep her voice military calm. “But…not really a choice, was there?”', '“Thank you.” He squeezed her shoulder.', 'She didn’t deserve thanks. If she’d done her homework on other ships. If she’d not been avoiding using her foot. If she’d just had her priorities straight—hell, if Eugene had been in the pool, he’d have figured this out faster than she did. She’d been trying to fit too many things into her life and had come within a hairsbreadth of failing at all of them. Failing her dance partner was disappointing. Failing the IAC could have been fatal.', 'Ruby let her breath out slowly as the medic came barreling around the end of the pool. “Make a phone call for me? I have a rehearsal I need to cancel.”', 'And after that, Ruby was going to go home, curl up in bed, and study every manual she could get her hands on. No one was going to come this close to dying on her watch ever again.', 'She didn’t have that many pieces of Before left, but keeping them didn’t mean keeping them in the same way and shape. Lindy-hop could go back to being just a social thing. But where she belonged in life After the Meteor, was here.', 'Here, she made a difference. Sprained ankle and all.', 'Text copyright 2019\\xa0© by Mary Robinette Kowal', '\\nArt copyright 2019\\xa0© by Jasu Hu']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['The Song'], 'Author': ['Erinn L. Kemper'], 'Body': ['A powerful near future story about two people on a whale-processing rig: one a researcher, the other a worker—and the discovery they make by listening to whale song.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Whale song echoed through the water in long, wistful moans. A pod calling to one another, repeating the same refrain.', 'Dan paused in his inspection of the pier and floated at the ten-meter mark. A slight chill filtered through his wet suit and he tucked his gloved hands into his armpits to keep them warm.', 'Beyond the steel lattice that supported the oil rig—repurposed and renamed SeaRanch 18—ranged the twilight murk of open sea. No hulking shadows drifted along the edges of visibility. If the whales came within eyesight, their song would give him one bitch of an earache.', 'Pods rarely ventured near the rig. Some orcas had been acting up, but that was in a distant feeding ground. And sharks only circled in when the cowboys harvested a whale to process and package for transport. With no active orders, it was a good time for Dan to do a round of maintenance.', 'Whale music had a weight to it, a ponderous, profound theme. The deeper notes resonated in his tissue and filled him with sweet nostalgia. A stuttering creak swept through—the slow rocking of a porch swing, a patio door caught in a summer draft. Then, the soft groan of settling into freshly laundered sheets for a long, long sleep.', 'Bright chirps punctuated the song today. Humpback calves, perhaps, learning to sing like their fathers.', 'Dan ran his hand along one of the steel legs that anchored the rig to the ocean floor. Bits of metal sloughed from the surface and drifted off in ashy motes. A few taps with his dive knife made a dull thud, rather than the cheerful ping of healthy steel.', '“Good thing I didn’t wait ’til the scheduled check. We’ve got evidence of corrosion. Might be time to replace the magnesium.” He spoke into his headset.', 'Crackling static came back as Marge from maintenance replied. “Corrosion on Support One, got it.”', 'He’d already inspected the lower docks that floated around the rig like tentacles. A bit of scraping and painting would get them up to snuff.', 'Then the whales had started to sing, drawing him deeper into the water where the music compelled him to stay.', '“If the block of sacrificial metal has failed, it’s earlier than usual. Probably not pure enough magnesium. Or the connection to the legs is failing. I’ll check the other three, see if there’s any deterioration there.”', 'He swam to the next leg. Solid. Same as the last two.', '“Looks like the problem is with the connection to the first. Easy fix. Lucky we caught it early.” He pictured Marge up there in her blue coveralls, pen clutched in her paint-stained fingers, adding to her list of things to keep her team busy.', 'The whale song drifted away as he ascended.', 'At five meters, he paused for a decompression stop—nothing but the click and puff of his own breathing to keep him company. He continued up, swallowing and wiggling his jaw back and forth until his eardrums popped, relieving pressure before the ache turned to pain.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Dan stopped to grab some lunch in the mess before heading to his quarters for a shower.', 'Swimming always made him hungry. When he was a kid in tadpole class, he wouldn’t get out of the water until the very last minute. Floating on his back, he’d relish the weightlessness, the other children’s splash and chatter bubbling around him. His mother’s frowning face would appear over him, her mouth moving, words muted. She’d always bring a big bag of snacks for his post-swim refueling. In his teens, a round of fevers and ear infections kept him out of the water until he thought he’d dry up. Alien voices strained toward him, as though rising from aquatic depths. He spent solitary days in his room writing lines for poems he never completed, words that filtered through his muddied thoughts but never merged.', 'When he first started diving he’d worried the scarring on his eardrums would keep him from deep-sea work, limit his earning potential. Luck was on his side there. Only once, after his wife died, had his ears started buzzing, sounds fading in and out. Stress-related deafness, the doctors said when they suspended his dive license and sent him to the company shrink. He was relieved when his hearing came back after her funeral.', 'Mess tray in hand, he walked the line. Baked beans, mac and cheese, chicken strips, pickled beets, mushy peas. Comfort food from the freezer or a can. Three weeks since they’d seen any fresh produce. Two weeks since they’d brought in relief staff.', 'Save-the-whale extremists had bombed the last transport before it even left dock, no survivors. The Free Willy and Hear Their Cry, Don’t Let Them Die! signs hadn’t done much to dissuade SeaRanch staff. Equipment sabotage and bombings were another story. SeaRanch was having trouble finding workers willing to risk the trip. Nobody knew when the next transport of relief staff would come.', 'Not that Dan was complaining. The money was good, his account climbing into seven figures now. He was no longer saving for a house with room to grow, away from the city, where a kid could actually play outside—his wife’s dream, not his. But he continued saving, mostly out of habit. Maybe he’d think of something to do with the money. A dream of his own. And, really, he had nothing calling him back to land—just an empty apartment with a half-eaten box of cereal in the cupboard and the TV remote perched on the arm of his foldout sofa. Better than the mess he’d had to clean up when his wife took permanent leave. He’d already forgotten the exact color of her eyes and the way her skin smelled after they’d made love. Almost.', 'A bump from behind and Dan’s lunch plate skidded close to the tray’s curved edge.', '“Shit, sorry. I thought…” One of the new scientists, easily identified by her green coveralls, caught the dinner roll that tumbled from Dan’s tray. “I assumed you’d moved along. I’m a total klutz.”', '“No worries, doc. Just daydreaming. You can have that one.” Dan grabbed another dinner roll and moved off in search of an empty table. He picked one in the far corner of the room and set his glass and utensils in their proper spots around his plate. Knife blade-in, bottom of the fork in line with the rest.', '“Mind if I join you?” The scientist had followed him to the table. She bit her lip as she waited for him to swallow his first bite of pickled beet.', 'Dan nodded and cleared his throat. “Be my guest. ', '.”', '“Cheers. Seems like most of you guys prefer to eat alone. Really, everyone here is pretty antisocial. I expected a lot more, you know, camaraderie.” She dragged her fork through her beans, leaving a winding river behind. “My name’s Suzanne.”', '“Dan.” He resumed sawing at a chunk of stew meat on his plate.', '“You think that’s whale?” Suzanne pointed with her fork at his meal.', 'Dan gagged on the mouthful he’d just taken, then washed it down with vitamin water. “Good lord, no. We don’t eat that here. This stuff’s a protein substitute. Tough as leather for some reason.”', '“Interesting. I’ve been catching up on the rules. You’re not supposed to give the whales names, individualize them. And yet you don’t eat them. Kind of a mixed message.”', 'Dan shrugged. “Whale meat’s too valuable for us lowly types. That’s part of it. The rules are there for a reason. Like we’re not supposed to call the processing area the ‘kill floor,’ but what the hell else ya gonna call it? It’s not like we tickle the whales until they turn into steak.”', 'Suzanne blew a soft gust of air out her nose. Not quite a laugh.', '“How ’bout you? A fan of whale meat?”', '“I have eaten it.”', 'Not really an answer. Dan pushed the lumpy stew around his plate, appetite gone. “So, you on whale-food production, or the plastic filtering project? I heard they managed to extract a hundred pounds of particles yesterday.”', '“I heard that, too. Nope. I’m an animal behaviorist. Here to assess recent changes in communication patterns. You in whale processing?”', '“Welder. Mostly underwater. Used to work the oil rigs all over the Pacific until that work dried up.” He tore up his bun and dipped it in some beet juice. “Now it’s just the SeaRanch rotation. But since we’re stuck here they’ve got me working topside, too. How’d they get you in?”', '“Snuck me over on a chopper from a research station down near Chile. I was there for a few months. The chopper never made it back to base.”', 'Dan prodded the stew with his bun and the beet stain turned brown. “The military’s out hunting, I heard. Until they wipe out that ecowarrior cell, you’re probably stuck here with the rest of us.”', '“Okay by me. You guys have a decent brain-scan lab; a few tweaks and I’ll have it set up right. Going to interview the survivors from the whale attack last week when they get back from patrol—see what they think instigated the attack. I can’t believe they’ve sent those guys out already.”', '“We’re in an all-hands-on-deck situation. A bit of roughhousing from one of the pods shouldn’t keep anyone from work.”', '“Is that what they’re telling you?” Frown lines gathered between Suzanne’s eyes. “Roughhousing?”', 'Dan nodded. A needle of unease pricked his spine.', '\\xa0', 'The shower head sprayed Dan with a fine mist. Another thing that the rig lacked—decent pressure.', 'At least it was hot. His feet tingled and turned red as they warmed up. Dan scrubbed mint shampoo into his scalp. The pipes pinged and gurgled. Then from somewhere deep in the plumbing came a foghorn cry. Dan stopped scrubbing and strained his scarred ears to listen.', 'Nothing. Just the hiss of the showerhead.', 'He grabbed the bar of soap and lathered his chest. Again, the plaintive call followed by a low bovine moan, then a reverberating chirp, louder this time. Pipes heating up? The dock rubbing against the rig’s legs?', 'The faucet screeched as he cranked the shower off. In the silence, nothing sang.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Unable to sleep, Dan paced the decks. A clear night full of stars. He had a regular circuit. Once around the main, take a ladder, around the next deck twice, then up and around again. He’d descend in reverse, working his way back, ladder by ladder, to the bottom. Twelve repetitions was the most he’d ever done of his circuit. Winding himself down until he could sleep without dreaming.', 'When he reached the top deck, he stopped. Suzanne leaned against a rail, gazing out over the night sea. The moon cast her hair in a ghostly halo. The breeze ruffled the fabric of her coveralls in a whisper of feathers.', '“Heya,” Dan called out, dismayed when she jumped a little. He hadn’t meant to startle her.', 'She turned, and frowned when she saw him, but it was a welcoming frown. “Hey, yourself. Couldn’t sleep?”', '“Nightmare. Equipment failure, slow suffocating death. If I believed in that whole self-fulfilling prophecy stuff I’d be done with diving.”', '“I can never remember my dreams, at least not what happens. Just sounds.”', 'Dan grasped the railing beside her and looked down into the inky foil of the night sea. “Sounds? Like what?”', 'She shrugged and turned away. “You know, it’s actually a couple pods acting up. Three different species. The attack on the harvesting boat the other day—those were orcas. But today a poacher alert came in and a patrol chopper went for a look-see. It flew low over some humpbacks, or what they thought were humpbacks, but it turned out to be a mix. Blues and humpbacks. What do you make of that?”', '“That isn’t usual?”', '“Nope. They dropped an underwater drone in. Recorded chatter. Literally. The humpbacks were singing, like they do, and the blues seemed to be listening, and responding.” Suzanne continued, talking more to herself than anything. “I’m going to add the sound files to my catalogue, as well as the visuals. See if we can get a match.”', '“A match on what?”', '“Behavior and specific bits of information. To translate more of their language.”', 'Dan raised his eyebrows. “So you’ve had some luck with that?” Part of him wanted to know what the whales were singing about, and part of him didn’t.', '“Sure. Mostly with the chatter. One phrase that means ‘come’ or ‘follow.’ They say ‘over here’ a lot. The song is a whole other thing. We’re going to go dart a couple this week. Then I’ll be able to monitor brain activity. Throw that in with the sound files and behavioral patterns. We might see what’s happening out there.”', 'A light blinked from the darkness of the horizon and they paused to listen to the hum of a boat going by.', 'On the deck below, a door squealed open and two women in lurched out onto the walkway. They wore carver-staff coveralls—purple to camouflage blood-splatter without being morbid. Arm in arm they staggered along, singing a slurred version of an old song, repeating only the words they knew, over and over, to the familiar melody.', '“Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, oh Da-ah-ny…”', 'Suzanne waved down at them, but the women didn’t notice.', 'She gazed back over the sea, her smile touched by sadness. “We were seeing some of that at the research station I came over from, too. People feeling the stress. Drinking to blow off steam. That and people taking permanent leave, you know. Must be worse here.”', '“I guess. Can’t fire those two, even though they’re ignoring the rules. Eventually they’ll run out of booze, and then we’ll have a worse problem.” Statistically, carvers were most likely to take a header over the rail or hang themselves from the pipes, according to the shrinks.', 'Suzanne nodded. “Seen that, too.”', 'Dan had never had a friend on the rig; didn’t see the point, what with people always coming and going. Another thing the shrinks considered a problem. But for him it made sense. If you got attached, you’d miss the person when they were gone. That’s when you felt lonely.', 'The laughter and song turned to gagging and heaving as the women took turns vomiting into the chop below. Then they hugged, slapped each other’s backs, and resumed singing. A slamming door cut off their song and returned the night to silence.', 'Moonlight fell in a silver swath across the water. Waves slipped over and were consumed by the boundless deep. Beside him, Suzanne breathed out a long sigh.', '\\xa0', 'The struts that supported the hydraulic lift on the kill floor showed some minor cracking in the welds. Dan did a full inspection and made the call. Shut it down. Give the butchers a break. Everyone was supposed to call them carvers, but Dan didn’t think of them that way.', 'Marge from maintenance helped him hoof down fresh tubing and all his welding gear.', 'He lined his tools up: measuring tape, pencil, grinder, spare disks, gloves, mask, welding rod, wire brush, hammer.', '“If you need a peon,” she said, “I’ve got a few slackers who could come down right now. Otherwise, let me know when you’re done and I’ll send the paint crew.” Marge gazed out the open bay door at the grey-cast sky. “You good?”', '“Yeah. No need to send anyone. Just have to replace a few pieces. I’ll cut them myself.”', 'His assistant, Brian, had gone for shore leave on the last boat, and the replacement never made it.', 'Maintenance was supposed to back him up, but everyone avoided working the kill floor if they could, with its massive adjustable saws and their diamond-honed blades, the long-handled traditional knives clipped to the wall, gleaming, ready for custom orders.', 'Marge sniffed the air and wrinkled her nose. “Man, I wish tech would come up with some kind of cleaning product that gets rid of the stink, you know? Forget about new butchering techniques. Who cares about cost-effective ways to debone a whale? Those people have a shit-ton of money to spare.”', 'Rumor was one of those TV chefs had designed an enormous fryer. He would cook a narwhal inside an orca inside a minke. Tables were priced at something like a hundred thousand a head. Proceeds were supposedly going to the plastic filtration project. A worthy cause. Dan pictured a crystal-chandeliered dining stadium. Massive steaks delivered to the linen-draped tables by forklift. CEOs, celebrities, and socialites carving delicate mouthfuls from dripping chunks of perfectly seasoned meat. His stomach lurched.', '“I’ll keep the bay doors open, air it out for the painters.”', 'She slapped Dan on the back. “Well. I’ll leave you to do your thing. This place gives me the heebies.”', 'Her footsteps rang hollow blows and she hummed a melancholy tune that was cut off when the interior door thudded shut—the melody so like the groans and sighs of whale song that echoed through his dreams.', 'A chill wind funneled in, flapping the fabric of his grey coveralls as Dan marked spots on the struts that needed replacing.', 'The platform would submerge for the harvesters to drag in their catch, then hoist the whale and pulley it forward across rollers, conveyor-belt style, to the equipment for butchering and packaging. The floor itself was a no-skid steel grating that let fluids drain away. Processing whales involved lots of fluids.', 'SeaRanch butchers worked to thumps against the rig’s legs as sharks, drawn by blood, swarmed and thrashed over bits of flesh that fell through to the sea below.', 'Today only the crackling buzz of Dan’s welder and the shrill wail of the saw blade ripping through metal vibrated the kill floor.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '“See these groups of sounds. That’s a phrase.” Suzanne pointed to a graph on her monitor. Her headset lay on the control panel, and whale song leaked out. “The males repeat these phrases—together they make up a song. Other males in the pod sing the same phrases, not in a chorus or anything. Echoing the pattern, like a round.”', 'She picked up an orange that rested next to her keyboard and held it to her nose. One side of the fruit had turned brown, the skin hardened in a dark continent. It had been weeks since fresh fruit had been brought to the rig. Dan missed the tart bunches of green grapes he’d take back to his quarters to snack on while he filled in his dive log. The orange must have come with her.', 'Dan rocked in the swivel chair next to hers. “Can we listen to it?”', 'She unplugged the headset, and the room filled with the aquatic opera. A rippling tide of goose bumps rose on Dan’s flesh. He recognized the song. The same one he’d been hearing all week. During dives, in the shower, in his dreams.', 'Through the lab’s speakers, the whale song sounded diminished and eerie. Suzanne had her eyes closed, and the monitor cast grey light over her weary features.', '“You get any sleep last night?” Dan leaned in close so he could speak softly, reluctant to break the music’s spell. Her hair smelled like honey.', '“No. I headed straight here after you left. I finished uploading my data, added it to the info your guys have been collecting. Established a link with the remote EEG.” She woke up another monitor—on it flickered an irregular-shaped circle wearing multicolored blobs of varying intensity. “Brain scans. Really different when they’re singing from when they are listening to another whale sing, or when they’re talking. Your harvesting cowboys just tagged whales from three different pods this morning; the ’bots established a link about an hour ago.”', 'Dan grimaced as he imagined a dart injecting a barrage of nanobots into a whale’s bloodstream, then navigating into position, spinning their organic wires, knitting through brain tissue before lighting up to interface. These maps of the whales’ brains were a real-time image of the activity. The whole thing creeped him out. Sometimes he wondered if microscopic ’bots roamed around in his bloodstream, taking readings, boring minute holes through vessel walls, riding the current of his heartbeat, to gain access to some organ or another. SeaRanch tracking their workers, like they did the whales.', '“So, which is which?”', 'She hit a button and four brain-shaped balls of light projected into the middle of the room. Suzanne spun her chair around and got up. Pulses of light rippled like lightning flaring in a cloud bank. She walked through the projected scans, blooms of neon bruising her features.', '“These are two orcas talking.” She held up both arms as though embracing the image. “This, a humpback singing. This one is listening to the song. This over here is a human brain engaged in singing with a choir.', '“Singing, for humans, creates an emotional response. It affects the brain chemistry.”', 'Dan approached the brain scans of the whale singing. “I know this song. I heard it when I was diving the other day.”', '“It’s what I’m hearing from whales in this sector. Different from the songs I heard when I was stationed over in the Indian Ocean. Usually each pod has their own song, but they do sometimes teach theirs to another pod. When I get some idea what they’re singing about we’ll see if it’s at all connected to the heightened aggression.”', 'She turned the volume down and sat back in front of her monitor to type, humming “Danny Boy” and frowning at the screen. Dan remembered his wife had done that at the beginning of their marriage—hummed songs she’d heard on the radio while she sorted laundry or repaired her vintage pop-up toaster. He couldn’t remember when she’d stopped.', 'The rest of the day, Dan pictured Suzanne, humming in the lab, her orange pressed to her lips, Christmas colors washing over her hair as the whales sounded their mystery out to the sea.', '\\xa0', 'In the mess, Dan served himself a healthy breakfast of oatmeal, dried figs, and a cup of green tea. The liquid rhythm of his own chewing, punctuated by the oar-lock creaks of staffers shifting in chairs, the squeal against the floor as they slid those chairs back and forth, coming and going in their red and green and purple and blue, the thump of the swinging doors—when Dan let his gaze lose focus, let those sounds fill the space, they took on a new quality.', 'Sounds making phrases. Phrases repeating, joining together, becoming song.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'He didn’t see Suzanne for a week. He was drawn to her, and so he avoided her. Stuck to a routine of work and sitting in his room. He filled out his dive log every night, and between entries he struggled to capture the whale song.', 'Like a memory just out of reach, the song slipped away from him.', 'When he did see Suzanne, he didn’t recognize her at first. Her green jumpsuit that had once strained with the fullness of her breasts and hips now hung straight to the floor, except for a bulge in one pocket he assumed was the orange. Headphones were clamped to her ears; her hair no longer curled like sea-foam, instead it had decayed to the tallow-white cast of old bone.', 'She walked quickly, despite her frail appearance, and with purpose. Dan followed.', 'He wanted to ask if she’d managed to translate any of the whale song. His dreams continued, drawn every night on its current. He wanted to show her his poem. Together, perhaps, they could find the right words. And then maybe he could get a proper sleep.', 'Just last night he’d dreamt that his wife shared his bed, her skin grey in the moonlight that spilled through his one small porthole. She lay beside him, eyes black and swirling with phosphorus, her dark hair in seaweed whorls across the pillow.', '.', ' Dan’s skin tingled with the cool wash of her breath.', 'She lay still, her wrists bound in the cuffs of gauze she’d been wearing when he signed the cremation order, her pearled skin threaded with dark veins.', 'The sheets rustled, though she hadn’t moved. She stared at him the way she always did, with sad, lonely eyes—wanting something, expecting it. She opened her mouth, her throat contracted, and out came her song. Low, hollow flute tones, like wind across a bottle top, short foghorn blasts, shuddering squeaks like skin slipping around in a bathtub, then a rasping exhale that flooded the room with the dank brine perfume of the sea.', 'Dan woke that morning, his porthole open, his bed dampened by sea air and sweat. Each day he rose exhausted, the whale song robbing him of a proper rest.', 'He hoped Suzanne could provide some insight as to why the song tormented him, trailing in his wake as he attended to his duties, day in, day out.', 'Suzanne stepped out onto the deck near the kill floor loading bay. Dan joined her. She didn’t notice him at first, as she leaned over the railing to look at the sea under the rig. Below them, a small pod of bowhead whales schooled around the rig legs. Suzanne put her hand over her mouth and shook her head, then looked up at Dan, her eyes wide and empty.', '“What’s going on?” Dan had never seen whales behave this way.', '“A special rush order came in. For meat prepared the traditional Inuit way. The pod followed the harvesters here. Attacked the boat and tried to capsize them, from what I heard.” She stalked down the hall to the kill floor.', '“Hey, c’mon. Let’s go to the cafeteria—or to your lab to see what the song’s doing. If there’s any new chatter.”', '“I know what the song is doing, with this pod anyway.” She tapped the headphones. “They’ve stopped singing. One or two of them had taken it up, but then the cowboys rode in and ’pooned a female. That’s why I came to check it out. No chatter at all. But their brains are flaring like a fireworks show.”', 'She shoved open the double doors and stepped onto the kill floor.', 'The flensing had already begun. Four carvers stood atop the whale, with long knives like curved hockey sticks, slicing deep into the whale’s side, the blades sliding through in long lines a few inches apart.', '“She’s dead. But look at them.” Suzanne pointed down.', 'Through the metal grate he could see the pod that had followed the harvesting boat surge and strain for the kill floor, mouths open, before they slipped back under. Their bodies collided, stirring great spumes gone pink with blood.', 'As the carvers pried long slabs free and wrestled them into the shed-sized cooler containers, the whales below calmed, then dove from sight.', 'Suzanne cocked her head and held up a finger. “Oh. Now… one of them is singing again.” She pulled a remote screen from her pocket and tapped it. “And the blue whales out in sector thirty-eight have picked up the refrain. It still spreading, you know. More and more pods are singing the same song. Like a virus moving through the population. And those that aren’t singing are diving. Have you heard? As a group, diving and never coming up. I can’t stop it. Can’t save them.” She pulled the bud from her ear. “You want to listen? This is a pod of minke whales out near Japan. The song sounds different, they don’t have the same range. But they try. They just keep singing and singing.” She stared out the loading bay door, over the water, her unwashed hair slack on her shoulders.', 'Dan shook his head. He could hear the song without the headset—or feel it. A memory echo that quaked up from the metal grating, shivering through him.', '“Hey, what’s with the orange?” A feeble attempt to distract himself.', 'Her hand went reflexively to her pocket and tapped it. “The smell helps me think. My daughter loved them. Cut up with the skin still on. She’d put a whole wedge in her mouth and smile an orange-peel smile. She never got to see whales. The ones in the zoo were long gone to breeding programs, and we lived so far from the ocean.”', '“I’m sorry.” Dan almost reached out to touch her, offer some kind of comfort.', 'Suzanne sighed and walked away, the doors thudding shut behind her.', 'The carvers sliced another long strip. All but Dan were oblivious to the song.', 'He stared into the dead whale’s eye, a dark pool surrounded by a nimbus of blue. The butcher-shop stench of raw burger and coagulating blood still held lingering traces of the whale’s dying breaths—fish rot and sewage.', 'The floor seemed to surge and recede as he made his way to the door, arms out to keep balance. The phantom song thrummed in his eardrums as he lurched down the hall, away from the dead whale and the wet smack of blades through flesh. He slid one shoulder along the wall or he would have fallen in a sweaty, nauseous heap on the floor.', 'There was a reason staff were supposed to stay away from the kill floor. And a reason why all the butchers had to go for regular shrink visits.', 'On the main deck he leaned his forehead against the cool steel rail. The vertigo, and the song, subsided as he took deeper and deeper breaths of the fresh sea air.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The song had spread to all sectors in the Pacific. Speculation among the crew included theories that the whales were coordinating for attack, or escape. They were communicating with aliens. They were evolving. They were regressing.', 'A helicopter full of harvesters rushed to Sector 82 when the com-tech noted evasive swim patterns from one pod. Poachers. About 50 percent of SeaRanch whales had GPS chips so the company could track them and send harvesters to fill meat orders. Before the harvesters could get there, the whales had swum off, leaving a capsized boat, and a bunch of happy sharks feeding on the contents of the fish hold, as well as a few of the crew.', 'Rescuing poachers was not in the harvesters’ mandate, so they left the men waving up in distress, and followed the pod to make sure none had been injured. The whales had joined with two pods from Sector 85. Some breached and lobtailed up out of the water, then dove amongst the massive herd, their song thundering through the monitor’s headset so loud the tech wearing them had to cut his feed.', 'And that morning, the mess crew had discovered two of the women carvers dead in the kitchen. They’d each sat on a floor drain and used fileting knives on their femoral arteries, their last bottle of whiskey empty beside them.', 'A quick hosing down and the kitchen floor was spotless again, but the mood at breakfast was dark.', '“No matter how much overtime they pay us, it’s not worth the headache. If a relief crew doesn’t show soon, I’m going to swim for it,” Marge joked, her voice flat, gaze hollow.', '“I don’t know if that’s such a good idea with the whales acting like they are. I have to go under the docks to do some repairs, and I gotta say, I’m a little nervous.” Dan stirred his oatmeal, the brown sugar an inky swirl in the clotted white of powdered creamer. “Not that they’ll hurt me or anything, but if they come too close, that song’ll rip into my eardrums and rattle my brain.”', 'Marge spoke through a mouthful of reconstituted eggs. “What song?”', '“The one they’ve all been singing. They’ve got a scientist working on it. Sink or sing. She can’t figure out the why of either. You haven’t heard it?”', '“Nah. My crew’s more worried about the vandals. Someone’s been writing on the walls, using paint from our supply closet. Weird shit. About the whales and how they’re coming for us. About how they can hear us, they know what we’re planning. I have to send a bunch of my people in for eval with the shrink in case we’ve got another person itching for self-annihilation. Once they’re done with maintenance, I think they’re planning to haul the rest of the crew in, one by one, for a good shrinking. You won’t be able to skip out this time. The higher-ups are thinking we’ll start offing ourselves. So they’re watching all of us now, not just the carvers. I think, as a deterrent, they might withdraw the suicide comp package.”', 'Dan put down his spoon and knit his hands together, remembering his wife’s wrists, like mouths split wide, blood already dried in a blackened sheet so he had to pry her from the floor. He remembered how she was the last time he saw her alive. Remote. Fixed on something inside, already done with trying to bridge the distance between them.', 'The last thing she’d said to him. ', '.', 'He’d shrugged and picked up his bag, the door already open. ', 'And that was how they’d left it—him thinking she was nuts for worrying. He’d missed what she was really saying, just like he always did.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Dan kept an eye out for Suzanne at the mess, on deck, even down in the hold. He had a new poem he wanted to show her, folded up in his pocket. Finally, after two busy days repairing the corrosion of the rig’s leg and overseeing the tethering of a new bucket of sacrificial metal, he went to her lab.', 'The darkened room wore the bitter perfume of fresh orange peel. Suzanne’s movements as she worked the controls on her keyboard seemed sluggish.', '“The song isn’t translatable. At least not in human terms. I kept thinking it must be instructions, locations, something like that… but now I think it’s emotion. How can we comprehend what goes on for whales on an emotional level? Is it anger? Sadness? Regret? Any sense we make of it is likely anthropomorphism or projection. A mirror of ourselves.” Her words slurred together. She leaned in close to the display, squinting at the dots that littered the oceans of the world, pods migrating through their territories, but not free.', '“I brought you some tea.” Dan held out the cup, but she ignored it.', 'He pushed some papers aside on her desk and set the cup and his poem down next to the orange, its skin torn open to expose the brownish pulp of inner flesh.', '“The aggressive behavior has ceased; did you know that? I’ve looked at old research done when rats become overpopulated. First aggression, even toward each other, cannibalism, then pathological withdrawal.” Her words came faster, fueled by her frustration. “They become despondent. Don’t eat, except in the company of other rats. Infant mortality climbs as high as 96 percent. Or there’s the learned-helplessness experiments done on dogs, who would eventually just lay down and whine when they realized there was nothing they could do to stop the shocks.” She wiped her eyes and looked at her fingers as though surprised to find them dry. “Now most pods are singing the song. But there are new anomalies. An entire pod up north beached itself. Another in Australia… more reports of cows diving as they deliver their calves. Too low for the babies to make it to the surface in time for the air to touch their skin and get them breathing. At least ten calves in three different pods… birthed, then drowned in the past two days… trying to determine if these pods are singing the song. It appears they aren’t.”', 'When she stood, she tilted to the side, almost fell, but grabbed the back of her chair, knocking it against the table. Tea sloshed from the cup onto his poem. His words blurred and bled through, merging in a dark stain.', 'Dan moved to help Suzanne. She waved him off.', '“This is the limbic lobe.” She extended her hand into one of the projections; a sputtering blue light bloomed and died on her open palm. “Emotional expression, empathy, the formation of memories. This one’s an orca. The lobe is proportionally much larger than in humans, made up of three different parts. I was seeing a lot of activity that suggested anger, fear, frustration. Or the whale equivalent. Not anymore. I don’t know what this is. Acceptance. Despair. Surrender.”', 'The chair shifted as Suzanne slumped against it, the wheels sliding away. Dan caught her around the waist and helped her to the floor.', '“What did you take?” He felt her wrist for her pulse, a light, irregular flutter. Her skin, cool and spongy with sweat, had a grey cast to it, as though filtered through underwater dusk. “I’ll call the medic. Hold on.”', '“No, no, no. Really.” She pulled her hand free and gazed up at the EEG readings. They rippled with light like storm clouds. “All the wonder, the joy, it’s gone. It’s too late. We’ve eroded their spirit. There’s nothing left for them but to sing until harvest time. You don’t need to stay. But please, turn up the volume before you go.”', 'Dan moved to the instrument panel. He hesitated, hand over the com-link. Instead he turned up the song until it quaked in his stomach, drummed along his spine.', 'Then he sat on the floor beside Suzanne and took her hand. He closed his eyes for a moment, listened to the music. Creaks, groans, echoing calls, asked then answered. The whales singing together. For one another. With one another.', '“I’m here. I’ll stay with you.” He spoke into her ear and squeezed her hand tight.', 'Suzanne took a slow shuddering breath, her eyes glassy reflections of the storm above. She didn’t squeeze back.', 'Feeling foolish, but knowing he must, Dan joined in the song, attempting the rumbling moans—like tectonic plates rubbing against one another in a slow dance—the bright chirps. His voice rose to meet the whale’s music, his throat ached as he strained to match it, note for note.', 'No words for the song. Just sounds. Sensations.', 'He imagined the song ringing down the rusted piers, vibrations transmitted through water, calling the whales. He turned up the volume until the floor shuddered and rippled. Perhaps the whales were already here, bodies pressing against metal, calling to him.', 'Suzanne’s expression changed from puzzled to one full of sadness and wonder as she slipped from here to gone.', 'Dan and the whales’ voices surged together, their song carrying her over to the deeps.', 'Text copyright © 2019 by Erinn L.

      "{'Title': ['Old Media'], 'Author': ['Annalee Newitz'], 'Body': ['The story of a freed slave and a robot professor, trying to figure out what it means to be in love while they watch old anime from the 21st century.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'They were in the back room making out. What else were they supposed to do on a slow afternoon when nobody came into the store? Michael had taken his goggles off and John was kissing the soft skin of his eyelids while simultaneously groping for some kind of access point into Michael’s extremely tight pants.', 'Out front, Bella was reading the music feeds in her goggles and not even remotely pretending to ignore them.', '“You sound like rutting ', '!” She’d taken to using a fake plural form of “moose” for her own whimsical reasons. “Don’t get any fluids on the goddamn merchandise!”', 'For some reason, John could not stop laughing at the moose plural joke. Every time he caught his breath, another fit of giggling would rob him of it, until at last he sank dizzily to his knees. He steadied himself by hooking fingers into Michael’s waistband and looking up at his friend, also laughing, amused by John’s amusement.', 'Michael was studying paleontology at the University of Saskatchewan, and had been trying to grow authentic dinosaur feathers on his head for weeks. Thick red and white down stuck out of his pale blond hair on flexible quills, perfectly framing his wide blue eyes and the short puff of his beard. John thought the full effect made him look almost comically Western, like an English barbarian from the old anime feeds he liked to watch.', 'But it was also kind of sexy. And here he was, right in the perfect spot to unlock the grippers holding Michael’s tight pants in place. Even when Bella started making extremely realistic moose noises, John was undeterred in his quest to make Michael tremble with more than laughter.', 'Afterward they both slid to the floor, resting their slightly damp backs against the wall. A languid sense of goodwill spread from John’s extremities upward to his brain. He liked it back here beyond the Employees Only sign, staring at the dusty, half-biodegraded boxes of recent arrivals. Bella bought most of her merchandise from estate sales and warehouses on the prairies, but a lot came from customers in Saskatoon too. Tuesdays and Thursdays were buyer days, and there was always a boisterous line of what seemed to John a completely random assortment of people: aging hipsters with party clothes from the ’20s; college students wanting to trade armor for shreds or vice versa; grandmothers with unbelievable treasures like the ash pleather 2090s boots he was wearing right now; and people from far up north who’d heard the kids were obsessed with old all-weathers and wanted to make a few credits while their families loaded up on supplies at the farm co-op.', 'It made John think of times before he was born, long before his shit life, or at least the shitty parts of his relatively okay life. Last year at this time… he didn’t want to think about it. Every night he told himself he was safe now, gone legit with a name and a franchise. Nobody owned him anymore. He stared harder at a box overflowing with self-repairing scarves from indeterminate time periods. Maybe they were made yesterday. Maybe sixty years ago.', 'Michael was nuzzling his neck, dinofuzz tickling John’s ear. He tugged John’s collar down to get a better angle and made a murmuring noise when he saw the brand.', '“I like your sexy scar. What do these numbers mean? Zed-nine-one-four-three-zed?”', 'John pulled away and felt every muscle in his body stiffen. The familiar numbness oozed down his neck into his torso, killing contentment as it spread.', '“It’s nothing. Just from when I was young and stupid.”', '“Is it a special date or something?”', '“That was my identification number when I was a slave, sweetie. Didn’t you know?” John made his tone so sarcastic that Michael snorted out a chuckle. Sometimes the truth, told right, was the best lie.', 'Beyond the door, John heard the sound of customers—a big group, their voices merging into a wave of indistinct, excited sounds. Probably party shopping. Bella might need help. He stood up abruptly and left Michael lounging among piles of textiles that proved the world had existed long before John was in it.', '\\xa0', 'Until this past year, John never had access control over his own room. He and the other boys lived in the indenture school dormitory, and bedtime was when the supervisor wiped his hand over the lock and let them in. If he let them in. Sometimes there was a just-in-time job on a batch of engines, and they worked for twenty-four hours straight. He still sometimes felt an ache in his fingers from doing post-production on each part as it came out of the extruder in the icy 3-D printer room. Still, when they were back in the dorms, John usually figured out how to escape again. He wanted access to the public net, and there was one particular admin who had a weakness for brown boys from down south. John spent a lot of nights writing in the admin’s cramped cubicle, mostly naked, focusing intently on comments in his journal feed so he could tune out his benefactor’s creepy gaze.', 'But now he was here, sharing an apartment in Saskatoon with the only person on Earth who knew his old names: Threezed and Slaveboy. When he met Med last year, he confessed that he’d been writing a journal on Memeland under the name Slaveboy. It turned out she was a fan. He’d never actually met one of his followers in person, and decided impulsively that they would be friends forever. It turned out to be the best decision he’d ever made in his roughly twenty years on Earth.', 'The door clicked open as he arrived and whistled its “hello” tune. He and Med were supremely lazy about programming the place beyond the basics, so he kicked the wall to turn on the lights and start the kitchen. The warm indoor air smelled faintly of fish sauce and frying garlic from somewhere else in the building.', 'Maybe one day he’d get tired of the contours of this apartment with its minimal furnishings. But it was hard to imagine ever getting enough of its safe shape, the kitchen booting up alongside him and a slice of his bed visible beyond a mostly closed curtain. It was only when he was alone like this, in complete silence, that John allowed himself to believe he was still alive. The quiet was like one of those silver emergency blankets he’d seen in twentieth-century American movies. It was the way the fantastically kind police wrapped you up after they’d rescued everybody from the monsters, the fire, the tidal waves, the buildings falling from space, the evil robots, the shadow animals, and the ghosts of every dead person wronged by the living.', 'A memory invaded him, unbidden, like a hiccup of pain.', 'Last year, he’d found sanctuary in Saskatoon. John’s new master wasn’t like the other ones, at least in some ways. She was a scientist, and she was working on some kind of secret project with Med. He didn’t understand everything about what they were doing, but he knew they were trying to help people who’d gotten addicted to corporate pharma. After the project went live, his master went into hiding. She left him behind with Med—but not before buying him a franchise that granted him full rights in the city. That night, he kept activating the readout from his chip on the mobile’s login screen: ', '. The English word morphed in his mind as he tried to feel its reality. ', '…', 'Maybe the warm feeling in his back was actually a lack of feeling. A lack of fear. He had a vivid recollection of how the lab smelled in that moment of unburdening, a mixture of crushed grass and coffee.', 'That’s when Med sat up rigidly, hands flat on the lab bench. She turned to him, her eyes blank. “Get out of here, now!” And then she stood, grabbed him with a shocking strength, and dragged him to the back exit. “Go!”', 'He glanced back to see what Med had sensed wirelessly: agents arriving, the ones who’d been chasing his old master. A man and a huge, armored bot from the property police. He turned back just once before he fled, and thought he saw Med transform into an avenging angel. Only she was better than an angel. She was real, made of carbon alloy and flesh, not feathers and faith. She’d saved him. Possibly she’d even saved the world.', '\\xa0', 'John breathed shallowly, trying to make himself as soundless as the room. Nobody could hear him. He was safe. It wasn’t like last time; the agents were long gone. He held his breath for five serene seconds before the Yummy Pan made an irritated noise and he knew he should start making dinner.', 'He was scooping protein-flecked porridge into a bowl when Med opened the door. She looked like a textbook example of the absent-minded professor, blond hair perfectly pinned back and lab coat perfectly rumpled.', '“How nice that you’re eating tissue from extinct amphibians.” Med could identify almost anything by smell, though she rarely mentioned it around humans. It made them too self-conscious, especially when they realized her abilities extended to smelling where they had been—and sometimes even their emotional states.', 'Still, for all her robot superpowers, Med couldn’t really master the art of sarcasm. Partly that was because she wasn’t a very sarcastic person, and partly because John always did something silly to undermine her deadpan cool.', '“I love fake frog.” He took an exaggeratedly large bite. “Mmmm, the taste of synthetic biology.” He posed with the spoon and bowl next to his face, like the preternaturally cheerful kid in the ads for Yummy Pan. For some reason, it never failed to make Med grin. Her goofy expression hovered briefly over his memory of that long-ago divine fury, and John had to pull himself back sharply from giving a name to what she made him feel.', '\\xa0', 'The library’s Media Experience Lab was the result of some big grant the university got back in the 2120s, and it hadn’t been updated since. The signs were all done in those old animated fonts that switched back and forth between puffy rainbow letters and classical serif typefaces. Foam chairs, once luxuriously padded and tricked out with knobs for adjusting everything to ergonomic perfection, were mashed into submission, stuck in awkward positions that only worked for really tall people or really short ones who wanted to sit bolt upright. Somebody had made the streaming cubicles out of fake recycled materials, so you could watch twenty-first century immersives while surrounded by biofibers imitating plastic imitating wood. John thought the saddest part of the whole retro setup—but also possibly the most adorable—was the dusty Innerfire cube, installed when everybody thought full-body experience implants were right around the corner. In all his months coming here, he had never seen anyone go inside.', 'John slid into his favorite booth next to the back wall. He could watch everyone coming in while also keeping an eye on his monitor, currently streaming a century-old comedy anime called ', '. He liked the story, about a girl named Haruhi pretending to be a boy, learning all the bizarre things boys do to make themselves seem more attractive. Haruhi was so charming in her suit and tie that all the girls requested “him” at the host club. She had no choice but to keep up the charade, because she was a poor scholarship student at an elite high school, and she owed the other hosts money. John swept a few of the episodes onto his mobile, stashing them to show Med later as yet another example of weird human culture.', 'After two quarters auditing classes, John was going to matriculate as a freshman. It still didn’t feel real. The city franchise got you more than he ever imagined he’d have, back when he was slaved to the factory. Free education, free medical, free net connection, and freedom to live and work anywhere in the Saskatoon metropolitan area. A new implant that broadcast his new identity: John Chen, normal free boy from an exurb called Lucky Lake. No indenture record. No record at all, other than a secure enclave bioprocessor that verified his identity to the city co-op.', 'Out of the blankness of his digital past he’d made an entire imaginary history for himself, in case anyone asked. Homeschooled, he would say. Mostly worked on agricultural bot repair, keeping the sensors, planters, and harvesters updated with the latest patches and hardware tweaks. At twenty-one, he was older than average for a student, but he fit the profile of a farm kid whose family needed a little extra time to raise the credits for his Saskatoon franchise.', 'So far, nobody had questioned this story. In fact, the most awkward moment he’d had was when Michael wondered about the brand that contained his slave name: Threezed, for the last two numbers in the sequence.', 'John should have gotten the scars smoothed out a long time ago. But he wasn’t ready to lose the familiar sting of seeing those numbers in the mirror when everything else was so different. Nothing had been normal for three years, after the factory sent the whole indenture class across the Pacific. Supposedly they had maintenance positions waiting for them on the Vancouver docks. The motors they’d been assembling back in the Nine Cities Delta were used in all kinds of industrial bots, so it made sense. But when they arrived, it turned out the contracts had fallen through in a way that only made sense to bureaucrats. John and his classmates were confiscated by the Free Trade Zone Port Authority, then confiscated again by Vancouver’s child welfare agency. In practice, this meant they spent a few months sleeping in familiar-looking dormitories where they tried to perfect their northern Free Trade Zone English accents.', 'For probably the fiftieth time, one of the hosts in ', ' was reminding Haruhi that she was low class. She’d brought instant coffee to their elite party, and the rich kids were physically repulsed. They’d never had anything but whole beans ground by indentured servants. John loved the exaggerated faces they made, their features growing bulbous and abstract as they squealed in dismay. Haruhi shrugged it off, but John thought the audience was supposed to understand that her feelings were hurt too.', 'A new librarian came in and sat behind the help desk. Her presence activated a sign overhead in that absurdly morphing font: “Yes, I’m an actual human! Ask me anything!” John imagined what Med would say to that. Just a little anti-bot sentiment, brought to you by some designer in the 2120s. Not the librarian’s fault. John noticed that she had two thick black braids and her eyes were slightly distorted by a pair of goggles made to look like twenty-first century glasses. Something about her looked familiar. Maybe she’d been in one of his classes?', 'He kept watching the stream in his cubicle until it was almost closing time.', '“Do you want to check that out?” The librarian peeked over the top of his cubicle. “I have to start shutting the workstations down.” Then she glanced at him again. “Weren’t you in Social Media History with me?”', '“Yeah. What did you think of that class?”', '“I loved it. I’m actually doing a research project with that professor about anti-robot representations in the late twenty-first century. So much video from that time was basically anti-automation propaganda, designed to make humans fear bots. It’s so weird to look back on all this old media and see how it’s still affecting us now.”', '“Like that sign.” He pointed over her desk.', '“Exactly!” She grinned.', 'He liked the way she described struggles in the past as if they were still happening, unfolding at some layer of reality just beyond conscious perception. They started talking about what classes they’d be taking next term.', 'He was about to escalate into flirtation when a man raced into the library, out of breath. He ignored John and put a hand on the librarian’s arm. “Can you find me some videos of people playing games in the twentieth century? I really need them for tomorrow.”', 'She stiffened and pulled back from his touch. “Do you have a catalog number?”', 'After he’d made a big show of sighing and pulling out his mobile and searching, the student flicked a number to her tablet.', 'The librarian walked back to her desk to look up the videos and the man leaned heavily on John’s cubicle, still catching his breath. Finally, he seemed to notice that he wasn’t alone in the universe.', '“Oh, hi, sorry to interrupt.” His voice betrayed no hint of apology.', '“No worries.” John started to pack up.', 'The man looked at him more closely, his pale blue eyes like flecks of aluminum-doped glass. “Where you from?”', '“Farm outside Lucky Lake.”', 'The man gave a big-throated laugh that vacuumed geniality out of the air. “No. I mean, where are you from ', '?”', 'It was a menacing question. John grabbed some videos with a cupping gesture, dumped them onto his mobile, and left without a word.', '\\xa0', 'When he’d first arrived in the Zone, people were constantly asking him where he was from. John and his classmates tried to explain, but nobody could hear anything after the words “Asian Union.” Their words bounced off an invisible, soundproof barrier of sympathy and disgust. Worried-looking officials kept telling the boys that it was illegal for children to be indentured. They never should have found themselves in this situation, sold by their school into contract at the docks. They could rest assured that Vancouver would sponsor them into foster care, with limited franchises that would allow them to work for the city. The Zone would never mistreat them the way the Asian Union had.', 'Then a caseworker “discovered” that they were over 18. John thought that was pretty amazing detective work, considering that none of the kids actually knew how old they were, and all their identity records were missing. Still, it was probably close enough, give or take a couple of years. Now it was obvious what Vancouver should do with them. They were shipped down to Vegas for auction. Profits would go to pay off the debt of some corporate entity whose name John would never know.', '\\xa0', 'He was definitely going to convince Med to watch ', ' when she got back from the lab. Bots never slept, so she was pretty much always up for binge watching on their apartment projection wall.', 'After he kicked the lights on, John saved the videos to their home server with a tossing motion and collapsed on the springy sofa that dominated the room. He couldn’t decide whether to activate the Yummy Pan or spark some 420 or run around screaming. That guy in the library had really pissed him off—not so much as an individual, but as the representative of an entire genre of dickbags who had never once been asked to produce an origin story for someone else’s amusement. It reminded him uncomfortably of Michael’s questions the other day. Obviously Michael had asked out of friendly curiosity, but the sentiment was the same. Where you come from is who you are.', 'The chime of the door interrupted his increasingly tight rage spiral. Med flopped on the sofa next to him and sighed. “That was a very long day of department meetings.”', 'Med had been begging the administration for money to cover an update to the lab’s protein library. John sat up to face her. “Did you get that funding you needed?”', '“Ugh. No. They don’t understand why we need new protein data when we already have a library from five years ago. Plus some bullshit from the dean about how I should make the students discover new folds themselves, and not just copy from a database like a bot would.” Med rolled her eyes but John knew she was genuinely upset. The dean never missed a chance to make insulting comments about bots around Med. She was the only bot professor at the university, and the dean liked to remind her where she came from. Or maybe where she didn’t.', '“Well, I have some good distraction for you.” John flicked the air and the wall opposite them displayed a menu of recent downloads. “It’s this crazy anime from the 2000s about an indentured student who has to earn her way out of contract by pretending to be a hot boy at a café for high school girls. You ', ' to watch it. It’s so incredibly weird.”', '“You’re lucky that the media library gets more useful the more out-of-date it gets.”', '“That’s not exactly true. But yeah, I know what you mean.” He decided not to tell her about the librarian sign. “Want to watch the first episode?”', 'Fifteen minutes in, and he could tell Med was feeling better. He watched her watch the screen, smiling faintly, her hand resting on the charger in the sofa arm. He wondered whether she was smiling for his benefit or if she really thought it was funny. Then he started obsessing about whether the subtitles really did justice to what was happening. Were they missing something? Maybe Med could help.', '“Could you learn Japanese if you wanted to? Like just download it or something? Then we’d know if these subs were good.”', '“It’s not like I would instantly know Japanese. I could get all the rules and vocabulary—enough to do a really basic translation. But I’d still have to learn how to use it. And some things just can’t be translated with words at all.” She gestured at the wall and the action froze on an image of light bulbs turning on. “Look at that. What does that mean? You only know from context that those light bulbs represent members of the host club, and each time one of them turns on it’s the guy figuring out that Haruhi is a girl. I couldn’t ever figure that out from a translation program.”', 'John thought about that as the action started again and Haruhi tried on the fancy school uniform that made her look like a beautiful boy. There was a lot of confused swooning.', '\\xa0', 'After three more episodes, John paused the action for a bathroom break. When he got back, Med was flipping through movies on the server idly. An urgent message blinked at the corner of the projection: “Streaming to unknown device.” That meant Med was streaming previews straight to her mind. The humans who made the streamer hadn’t thought about how robots might use their machines, so Med remained an “unknown device” on the network.', '“How’s job going?” Med divided her attention between John and whatever she was previewing.', '“Pretty good. I keep hooking up with Michael, but he’s starting to annoy me.”', '“I can’t even keep track of your hookups. Which one is Michael, again?”', '“Dinosaur hair guy.”', '“Oh yeah!” Med stopped streaming and took her hand off the charging pad. “He sounded nice?”', '“He’s nice but he’s just… I dunno. He asks too many boring questions.”', '“Like what?”', 'John tried to come up with a good way to explain it. “He asked about my brand. Which—why would you ask somebody about that after fucking them? So rude.”', 'Med didn’t pick up on his sarcasm, or she chose to ignore it. “I can see why he might be curious. Why do you keep it if you don’t want to talk about it?”', '“Why do you tell people that you’re a bot if you don’t want them to make snotty comments about it?” His voice rose in anger he hadn’t intended to express.', '“You know why. Because fuck those fuckers.” Delivered utterly without sarcasm. John had to laugh. She put a hand on his arm, and he felt an unexpected, shocking surge of love for her. Her skin felt just as soft and warm as a human’s, but beneath the biological tissues were metal actuators and processors. He liked knowing that she wasn’t human all the way through. Looking into her face, he never flashed back to the faces of his masters.', 'Yet he was still terrified. She was going to disappear. He’d wake up from this dream of student life in Saskatoon to find himself adrift with that psycho who bought him in Vegas, starving in the cargo hold of a boat whose engines were always on the verge of death. Tied up if he refused to go quietly to his master’s bedroom. Or maybe he’d awaken to discover that Med hadn’t made it out of the lab alive after shoving him out the door.', 'He needed to banish those thoughts. His skin was prickling. Med still had her hand on his arm, and a badass snarky look on her face.', '“Med, why don’t you ever hook up with anybody?”', 'The bot shrugged. “I haven’t installed any programs related to sexual desire.”', '“Why not?”', '“Just not interested. A lot of my siblings installed them, and they seem happy. But it never caught my attention.”', '“So you could install them now and start wanting to have sex?” John was fascinated.', 'Med looked a little annoyed. “As I said before about learning Japanese, it’s not like a bot can just instantly know something or feel something. You have to interact to get context.”', 'This was starting to sound kind of sexy. John wrapped his hand around Med’s arm, so that they gently gripped each other’s wrists. “You should do it. We should do it.”', '“I just said I wasn’t interested.”', '“How can you know you’re not interested if you’ve never tried it?”', 'She removed her hand and scooted back a few centimeters. “Can you explain why you don’t like that series ', ' but you do like ', '? It’s a matter of taste. Sexual desire just isn’t my taste. It doesn’t mean I don’t love you.”', '“You love me?” John’s heart was pounding all of a sudden, in a way that was both amazing and terrifying.', '“I wasn’t planning on blurting it out like that, but yes. Yes.”', 'He thought he was going to cry, and then he thought maybe he wasn’t going to be able to stop himself from kissing her. “I’m pretty sure I love you too.”', 'Illuminated by dim, white light from the text menu on the wall, they looked like artificial versions of themselves. John crumpled his hands into fists and jammed them against his thighs uncomfortably. He wasn’t sure what to do next.', '“So you can be in love but you don’t want to try having sex?”', 'She chuckled. “I’m not a media history major, but even I have watched enough media to know that love and sex aren’t the same thing.”', 'Of course that was true, and he’d had plenty of sex that didn’t involve love. But how could she be feeling the same way he was, if she didn’t want to grab him hard and throw him down and just… take him? A feeling this strong had to be translated into something physical. It begged for literalization.', '“I just don’t understand. Do you mean the kind of love you would have for a brother? Or for a super good friend?”', '“I do love my siblings, but this is not that kind of love. I mean, I can’t be sure it’s ', ' the same thing you would call love, but it’s a feeling of…” She paused for a moment and went still, as if she were streaming data. Then she spoke slowly. “It’s like there’s some part of you that fits perfectly inside my consciousness. It’s a feeling that goes beyond trust or friendship. Some kind of emotional infrastructure. Even if I were to isolate every single utility and program I use to think about you, I don’t think I could explain all the ways you occupy my mind. It’s… an emergent and ongoing process. Does that make sense?”', 'John wiped his eyes and looked at her openly, following the lines of her neck and cheeks, the perfect lab-grown pink of her lips. But she’d given him permission to look beyond that.', '“Is there something we could do together… something you’ve always wanted to do with somebody who loves you? Not sex, obviously, but something like that? Or not like that? I don’t know…” He trailed off and Med looked bemused. “Please don’t say watch videos.” They both laughed.', 'Med put a hand on top of one of his fists, and he laced his fingers into hers.', '“Actually there is something.”', '“Holding hands?”', '“No, although that’s nice too.” She let out a nervous titter. “I’ve always wanted to try sleeping.” She dropped her eyes and shifted uncomfortably, as if she’d just revealed some secret, transgressive kink.', '“I didn’t know you could sleep.”', '“I mean, I can go into sleep mode, or I can shut down. I can crash. There are a lot of sleep levels, but you’re not really supposed to go into them unless it’s an emergency or you need maintenance.”', '“Why aren’t you supposed to do it?”', '“Well sometimes it can damage memory to crash unexpectedly, but honestly I think the sleep taboo is mostly about security. Humans might steal a sleeping bot.”', 'John understood that fear all the way down to the most inaccessible parts of his consciousness. “Nobody can get you here. Not in our apartment. It’s completely safe.” His words came out hot and intense, the same way they sounded in his mind.', '“Do you want to try it?”', 'He said yes and let her lead him to the bedroom.', 'They lay down on their sides facing each other, giggling as they found comfortable positions in the awkwardly small space. “Okay, so I’m going to try. I should wake up in four hours so I can get to work in the morning. Are you ready?”', 'She looked so beautiful that John thought his heart would crack open like the space eggs in a kaiju movie, full of lava and lightning and life forms that had never walked the Earth. He took one of her hands. “I’m ready.”', 'Her eyes closed, and she shuddered slightly. Then her hand relaxed in his. He listened to her breathe. He looked at the shape of her skin over the carbon alloy of her bones. He wondered if she was dreaming. He thought of all the questions he wanted to ask her about everything. He almost started to cry again when he remembered what they’d been through last year, after they’d escaped. After they’d almost died. If he were ever going to talk about all that shit, Med would be the only person he’d want listening.', 'Watching her sleep for a while made him sleepy too. She never shifted around or made noises like a human, and it was deeply comforting.', 'John rolled onto his back and closed his eyes. He was still kind of horny, partly from the emotional overload with Med, and partly just from life. At least he was working in the shop tomorrow, so there would definitely be an interlude or two with Michael in the back room. Also, maybe he would ask out that librarian from his Social Media History class. He wasn’t sure he could love anyone else, but there were definitely a lot of people he liked in a sexual way. That wasn’t a bad thing.', 'As he drifted off, his thoughts began to buzz pleasantly with half-feelings and fragments of the day’s noise. Just before he joined Med in full sleep mode, he saw a flickering image of Haruhi in her host boy clothes, the subject of a desire that existed only in the lacy cracks that form at the edge of what we’re taught is acceptable. Even after a century of storage on media devices whose sophistication far outstripped the technologies that hosted her birth, she was still radiating beauty into the world.', 'Old Media, copyright © 2019 by Annalee Newitz', '\\nArt copyright © 2019 by Soufiane Mengad']}\n"

But of course, all is not as it seems.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Before I take on an investigation for someone, I first make at least a cursory investigation ', ' that someone. I did not adopt this practice out of any particular worries about the moral compass, or even in relation to my quite healthy sense of self-preservation. I investigate potential clients simply to avoid circumstances like this one, circumstances in which I wind up telling a story.', 'So I should have known. I should have ', ' known. I knew about the learned mouse before I agreed to work for Professor Thomasina Swallow. I have no one to blame but myself.', 'Professor Swallow was a human woman, then aged forty-four years, on the faculty of the Rookery here in town. If that seems young for such a prestigious gig, then other factors of her biography will no doubt shock you even further, to wit: She was unmarried, her area of study was, and is, Second Empire military history, and when she was just sixteen and still a student herself at the Ladysmith Academy, she was adopted by the learned mouse, Coleridge.', 'As for me, these are my particulars: I am the private detective, Connolly Marsh. I am an investigative dog.', '\\xa0', 'Professor Swallow found me at a bar in the Limestone Corridor—I don’t keep an office—and immediately made her intentions clear by settling down in the sawdust where I was enjoying a bit of rawhide and ruminating over a recently completed case.', '“Mr. Marsh,” she said, “I want to engage your services.”', 'I looked up at her. “Is it on a matter of some delicacy? If so, I’ll need to refer you to someone else. I’m quite indelicate.”', 'The professor detached her pince-nez from her hilariously small nose, folded them over themselves, and deposited them inside a locket hanging from the gold chain around her neck. Then she sat back on her hindquarters, stuck her muddy boots out from skirts now liberally coated with flakes of pine, and bellowed, “I need a beer over here!”', 'The other people present, mostly humans with a scattering of others, including the drinking hole’s owner, a curious cat familiar with the city’s jails, briefly stopped their hubbub to take in the scene. Me, a well-known dog about town, giving the side-eye to a woman dressed like a scholar and acting like a stevedore.', '“Make that two,” I said.', '\\xa0', 'The gist was this: She had killed a man.', 'She didn’t lead with that. First there was some obfuscation.', '“There’s a man where I work who is harassing me.”', 'Something for her bosses to settle, I told her.', 'It didn’t surprise me that a client would come to me with something like that. In addition to my investigative talents, I have a reputation—notice I don’t say that I ', ' a reputation—as something of a fixer. I’d leaned on people before.', 'She kept talking.', '“This man is threatening to blackmail me.”', 'This was more interesting. Though my history with secrets both real and imagined was, to say the least, fraught, I rarely resisted opportunities to turn over stones and see what was crawling under the everyday. Back then, anyway. I nodded at her to continue.', '“He came to my office this morning. Things\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. things got violent.”', 'I raised a paw to stop her. I’d just decided I probably didn’t want to hear any more.', '“He’s dead,” she said.', '“I’m going to stop you right there,” I said. The bartender was approaching with her pint glass and my bowl. It seemed best if nobody overheard whatever else she had to say.', 'After the bartender cleared out—and after I’d steeled myself with a couple laps of the house mild ale—I considered the risks, and I considered the length of my various tabs around town, including at the very bar we sat in. “I’m not saying I can help you and I’m not saying I can’t. Before I decide, I need to ask you two questions.”', 'She wiped some froth from her upper lip and nodded. That was good. That indicated she’d picked up on my feeling that this should be a quiet conversation.', '“First,” I said, “was it an accident?”', '“Oh, no,” she said. “Not at all.”', 'That was less good.', '“Second,” I said, “was it self-defense?”', 'She thought about it for too long. Then she said, “Probably not in the way you mean.”', 'Man, I hate it when they try to be clever.', 'I stood up. “Do you have a card?” I asked.', 'She dug in a pocket sewn onto her skirt and pulled out a classy-looking piece of parchment, started to hand it over.', '“Just show it to me,” I said. Humans. They think everyone has finely manipulating appendages. And pockets.', 'She held the card in front of my face and I memorized the particulars, especially her office address. “Is it safe for you to go back there?” I asked. “Can we meet at your office in, say, four hours?”', 'She thought too long again, then nodded hesitantly.', '“The body is still in your ', '?” I asked, maybe a little too loud.', '“I locked the door,” said the professor. “I put a note on the door telling the staff not to enter.”', 'I rolled my eyes. “Okay, we’ll see how well that goes. You stay here for at least half an hour. And don’t go back to your office until our meeting time, you got that?”', 'She was taking a long drink from her pint. “At least half an hour,” she said. “Agreed.”', '\\xa0', 'Outside, I spied a couple of crows perched on a wire stretched between two of the courthouse towers. I barked to get their attention. They just jeered at me in response, then flapped away in the drizzle.', 'I cursed to myself. Crows were the only knowledgeable creatures who still had much to do with their forebears, and it was hard to tell the varieties apart. Those two had been of the antecedent type, not knowledgeable. Or if they ', ' been knowledgeable, then they were rude as hell.', '“What’s up, Mr. Investigator?” The voice was raspy and familiar. “Why are you cussing at my kin?”', 'I turned around to find Cool Charles strutting on the boardwalk behind me. He was small for a crow of any variety, but there was no doubting the gleam of intelligence in the beady black eye he had turned toward me.', '“Your reputation would be better if you didn’t fraternize with that rabble, Charles,” I said.', 'He cawed, and I knew from past experience it was meant to be a laugh. “My reputation is irredeemable,” he said.', '“Yeah,” I said. “That’s going around. Look, I need some information.”', 'Cool Charles hopped closer, clearly interested. Crows, man, they’re always interested.', '\\xa0', 'I needed to cover some bases. One of them was making sure that I wasn’t walking into an open murder investigation. So, as was mandated by one of the court orders that I’m under, I stopped precisely one hundred feet from the entrance to police headquarters. None of the cops going in and out noticed me there in the little park across the street, and I was in kind of a hurry to talk to someone, so I threw my head back and started howling, which is something I’m pretty good at.', 'One of the older uniforms must have recognized me because nobody came over to stop my racket, at least not right away. After a few minutes, though, I saw a cheap suit I knew, wrapped around a portly human man like a too-tight sausage casing.', 'Of course they’d sent Henson. Who else besides my ex-partner ', ' they send?', '“You shouldn’t be here, Marsh,” he said. He was nervous, running his hand over his shiny, shaved skull.', '“Just availing myself of my rights as a taxpayer,” I said. “Got a question for the civil servants who so gallantly protect our fair polis.”', 'He snorted. “You paid your taxes this year?”', 'He had me there. I honestly didn’t remember. I got to the point.', '“Anybody caught a new body in the last couple of days, Henson?”', '“What’s it to you?” he asked. At least he did me the courtesy of not claiming he couldn’t tell me. The broadest particulars of open felony investigations—such as the fact of their existence—are matters of public record. I had a lawyer friend who loved to file information requests on behalf of reporters and the odd investigative dog. Henson knew that. If he stalled me now, it would just mean more work for him later.', '“I heard that you and the old team might be busier than usual is all,” I said. “Got a new client who’s interested in crime rates and so on. Has to do with people relocating, moving into town, that sort of thing.”', 'Henson looked incredulous. “You’re scouting for real estate agents? How the mighty have fallen. But no. Board’s clear. Has been for weeks.” He narrowed his eyes. “What’s really going on, Connolly?”', 'For a human, his instincts weren’t actually all that bad. We’d been a pretty good team before everything went to hell.', '“Nothing much,” I said. “Scouting real estate, like you said. Kibble doesn’t pay for itself.”', 'I trotted away, leaving him in the park in a drizzle that was turning to snow.', '\\xa0', '“She’s a professor at the Rookery,” said Cool Charles.', '“Tenured,” I said. “In the history department. I told ', ' that.”', 'We were in a diner off the square that was somehow positioned so that its front windows were always in the shadow of one or another of the gigantic triumphalist monuments that dominate that neighborhood. I was up on a bench seat in the booth we’d been shown to. Charles was on the table, pecking at a plate of hominy.', 'He filled me in on the particulars he’d gleaned. Some of it was interesting, some of it wasn’t. Any of it might prove germane. I was making mental notes, building up a file on the chance I decided to take the case, waiting for the classic Cool Charles bomb to drop. He always held the most interesting thing back for as long as possible.', '“Then there’s her family life,” Charles said.', 'I played along. “We’ve already covered that. Parents both dead, never married, no children.”', '“Yeah, well, she has a sort of adoptive father. Her godfather, actually. Another scholar type.”', '“Do tell,” I said. Luckily, Charles charges a flat rate, not by the hour.', '“Name of Coleridge, like the poet. Named himself ', ' the poet, in fact.”', 'Named himself? “He’s a knowledgeable creature?” I asked, like a sap, walking right into Charles’s setup.', 'Charles pointed his beak at the ceiling, swallowed, then turned me an eye. “Oh, yes. He’s a learned mouse.”', 'So, like I said, I should have known. I should have walked away right then. The blame is all on me.', '\\xa0', 'All knowledgeable creatures are fascinated with learned mice to one degree or another. You could probably draw up a sliding scale labeled ', ' on the healthy end and ', ' on the end that has my picture on it.', 'It’s hard not be be fascinated with the creatures who made you.', 'Maybe ', ' is too strong a word. ', ' might be a more accurate phrase. What cannot be denied is that it’s the alchemical processes developed by Isaac Newton and his partner Xerxes, the first publicly acknowledged learned mouse, which led to the so-called Flowering, the world-wide, centuries-long explosion of new knowledgeable creatures, from Nox, the first curious cat awoken by Newton and Xerxes, on down to every philosophical pig and argute crow today. On down to every investigative dog—including, of course, me.', 'Have learned mice been around forever? Did they awaken humans at some time in the distant past? Are they the secret governors of us all, operating independently of the Imperium, probably controlling it?', 'These really aren’t the kinds of questions you ask if you want to be taken seriously. They certainly aren’t the kinds of questions you ask if you want to stay a police officer.', '\\xa0', 'I sniffed the spot where Professor Swallow claimed the body had been again. Nothing.', 'Well, not ', '. The threadbare old rug told all kinds of stories for those with the nose to smell them, but there was nothing among the litany of pencil shavings, dust, spilled Mayan takeout, or even the somewhat surprising champagne of a vintage considerably pricier than you would expect to have ever been uncorked in a junior history professor’s office—nothing in any of that to suggest that the body of a dead human male had ever lain on it. There wasn’t even anything to suggest that a ', ' human male had ever lain on it.', 'I sighed.', '“I suppose,” I said, “you’re going to have to tell me what happened.”', 'The professor was sitting on a couch mounded with old quilts, where I’d told her to park herself when we’d entered her office a few minutes before and found it corpse-free. She had the corner of one of these quilts in her hands, worrying at it.', '“I don’t know what happened,” she said, not starting strong out of the gate. “Dr. Sedgewick was lying right here when I left to find you, and now he’s gone.”', '“What happened ', ' you came to find me,” I clarified. “All I know so far is that you believe you killed a man—a man named Sedgewick, apparently—and that instead of going to the authorities you came to me.” I knew a little more than that, but saw no reason to tell her so.', '“You must think I’m trying to hire you to help me get away with murder, then,” she said.', '“You don’t need me for that. There’s no body and no evidence that there ever was one. You’d never even stand trial.”', 'That set her back. She seemed to be considering her options for the first time. Thinking again. Not good.', '“A man named Sedgewick,” I prompted. “He came here to your office. Sometime this morning?”', 'She let go of the quilt. “Yes. Around ten thirty. I remember the time because when he knocked I looked at my calendar to see if I’d forgotten an appointment. I hadn’t. He didn’t knock a second time and he didn’t wait for me to answer. He just barged in waving that sheaf of papers and shouting about having my tenure revoked.”', 'There were a number of avenues of investigation opened up by her story. I decided to go with the most obvious.', '“What sheaf of papers?” I asked, looking around the office. There were dozens of candidates: piles of files, stacks of stapled pages, and random bundled sheets on every available surface, including the couch and the floor.', 'She ignored all of these, though, instead opening the satchel she’d been carrying when she found me at the bar. “This one,” she said, spreading the pages out on the carpet.', 'I recognized it for what it was even before I read the title page. The smells of the oily purple ink and the cheap, pulpy paper were familiar from too many of the pamphlets that once made up my secret collection of seditious conspiracy literature.', 'This was getting to be deep waters. Murder was one thing, but the laws governing publishing were at the level of Imperial edicts, not merely civic or territorial regulations. I really, really should have walked out of her office right then.', 'I read the first page.', ', it said. The byline was A. Shrew, a sort of catchall pseudonym used by dozens of anonymous counterculture thinkers and writers. I’d never really understood it. I’d only ever met one shrew, an elderly gentleman named Gary, whom I’d interviewed when one of his neighbors died of an accidental poisoning that Henson and I had briefly thought suspicious. He’d been gregarious and quite helpful. A model train enthusiast.', 'I realized I was drifting off course, and returned to the purple-inked pages.', 'I forced myself to stop reading. “Why would some underground pamphlet about a discredited theory cost you your tenure?” I asked the professor.', 'She spread her hands. “Because I wrote it,” she said.', 'That hung in the air for a few minutes while I studied her expression. She showed neither shame nor pride at the admission, neither fear nor defiance.', '“You wrote it when you were a student, you mean,” I finally said. “You were passionate and angry and testing the limits of propriety, taking up with odd people with odd ideas who claimed to be your friends. It doesn’t represent who you are today, or what you believe.”', 'She listened carefully, but instead of nodding eagerly she shook her head and I took another long hard look at the door.', '“I wrote it over the last two years, and it represents decades of disciplined scholarship. It represents what I believe to be true.”', '“You believe humans were woken from an animal state by learned mice?”', '“She believes it’s a good question to explore.”', 'The speaker squeezed through the crack beneath the door, a plump gray mouse with a tiny cane grasped in one paw.', '“Papa?” asked the professor. “What are you doing here?”', '“Keeping an eye on you, dear. As ever.”', 'There was a rumbling noise in the room that only cut off when I recognized it as my own instinctive growl. I fought down the urge to apologize.', '“You’re Coleridge?” I asked.', '“He’s ', ' Coleridge,” said Thomasina Swallow. “The Rookery’s chaplain and dean of the divinities school.”', '“Sorry, Vicar,” I said. “I thought that you\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. I thought that ‘explorations’ of that particular question were discouraged by your, um, colleagues. They certainly are by the Imperium.”', 'I’d never spent any time around mice. I hadn’t known they could shrug.', '“Learned mice are no more monolithic in opinions than we are in size,” said the Vicar. “There are many of us who believe the government’s strictures on historical inquiry are ill-advised.”', 'All very interesting. Aloud, I said, “What did you do with the body?”', 'I hadn’t known mice could smile, either. “What body is that, Mr. Marsh?”', '“Papa Coleridge,” said the professor. “I’ve already told him what happened.”', '“Have you?” asked the mouse, and I couldn’t help but agree with his arch tone.', '“You haven’t,” I said. “I’ve got no sign of a struggle, no evidence of violence, nothing at all to indicate that a crime was committed here.” I laid a paw alongside my nose. “Nothing.”', 'The professor strode across to her desk and picked up a sizable chunk of marble serving as a paperweight on one of the stacks of loose pages. She tossed it on the floor in front of me, scattering the unbound sheets of the heretical pamphlet.', '“Smell that,” she said.', 'I did. It smelled like blood.', '“Well,” I said, “that’s a weapon. Taken with a missing person, that’s enough. We’re going to have to involve the police, Professor Swallow.”', '“Ah,” said the vicar. “But no one is missing.”', 'I’d already fallen for one obvious trap that day while talking to Cool Charles, who—now that I thought about it—kind of reminded me of Coleridge in some indefinable way. I took a chance.', '“Nobody’s missing because you’ve just come from talking to Sedgewick in his office and he’s alive and well,” I said.', 'The mouse spent the time I was talking grooming his little whiskers. “Not exactly. I just came from the infirmary, where Dr. Sedgewick is resting comfortably. He’s recovering from a nasty blow to the head that required a rather large number of stitches, but no, I didn’t speak to him. Because he was asleep.”', 'A mouse with all the answers, except\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.', '“Why is there no blood on the floor?” I asked. “If the professor here beaned her colleague hard enough to spit his skull open, hard enough to put him so far out that she thought he was ', ', there should be a scent.”', 'The Vicar pointed to a corner of the rug with his cane. “He landed there. The blood spilled on several stacks of old, dreadfully written undergraduate essays—I have no idea why you keep those wretched things, Thomasina—which I consigned to the furnace in the subbasement several hours ago, now. So you see, Mr. Marsh, there’s really no further need for your services. Thomasina panicked, is all. Just a misunderstanding. If you’ll send an invoice to my office, you’ll of course be paid in full for the work you’ve done.”', 'I knew when I was being shown the door, but the mouse wasn’t my client, Professor Swallow was. When I looked to her for direction, though, she was looking at the vicar, her expression nearly unreadable. The part that wasn’t unreadable made my hackles rise. The part that was fear.', '“Right,” I said. “Your address is in the book?”', '“Just write Vicar Coleridge, care of the Rookery, and it will get to me. No need for a stamp, even.”', 'I used to know a woman who worked for the city’s small contingent of postal police. The regulations they enforce are even more strict and arcane than those of the civic police. I was pretty certain the vicar had just described some kind of postal fraud. I was equally certain he’d never be called to account for it.', 'I left the two of them there and took fourteen flights of stairs down to the Rookery’s enormous marble and limestone lobby. I was about to head out into the snowy, late afternoon darkness when I caught sight of the building directory out of the corner of my eye.', 'I trotted over and read through the list of names. I had more or less begun the process of compartmentalizing the day’s events, filing everything away into a place in my brain never to be consulted again, but something bothered me.', 'I kept reading the list of faculty and staff. Names, names, names.', 'How had the mouse known ', ' name?', '\\xa0', 'In addition to his considerable talents as an information broker, Cool Charles was my go-to when I needed to do some breaking and entering. This time, though, he proved recalcitrant.', '“Not the Rookery,” he said. “No way.”', 'He was playing some kind of game at the diner table that involved moving and re-moving pegs from holes bored in a triangular piece of wood. Show-off. Next he would be using one of the pegs as a makeshift tool of some kind.', '“It’s one door,” I said. “The door to a college linguistics department. How hard can it be?” I’d learned that Dr. Sedgewick was a linguistics professor specializing in textual analysis. I was interested in the contents of his office.', '“It’s probably so easy you could do it yourself,” said Charles, plucking another peg. “So why don’t you?”', 'It was just within the realm of possibility that I could spring a standard door lock clutching a pick between my teeth. But that wasn’t the only reason I wanted the bird along.', '“I need a lookout, too,” I said.', '“What you need is to have your head looked at,” said Charles. “That place is supposed to be positively ', ' with learned mice. Those guys don’t sleep, Marsh.”', 'This was one of the more pedestrian urban legends about learned mice. They don’t sleep. Another stated that they had no need to eat. Still another claimed they could hear their names spoken from miles away; the exact distance varied from teller to teller.', 'I didn’t believe any of that. For all the crazy things I’ve believed in my life—and there have been some doozies—I’ve never believed that there is any great secret about learned mice that can’t be explained by the facts that they are infernally smart and eternally patient.', 'I fancied myself pretty smart as well. I clambered down from the bench seat and nodded at the cashier, telling her to put everything on my tab.', '“Charles,” I said, “if you don’t see me around in the next few days, tell Henson to check the furnaces in the Rookery subbasement.”', 'The crow squawked. “You’re really doing it? You’re going to try and prove one of your crazy-ass theories by breaking into the Rookery ', '?”', 'I shrugged noncommittally and left.', 'Like I said, I fancied myself pretty smart.', 'Patient, not so much.', 'As I started down the street, I heard the diner’s door chime behind me, followed by the flapping of wings above.

Finally going to get a ', ' education?”', '“Everything’s a real education, Charles,” I said. “You know that, a knowledgeable creature like yourself.

We might need a little fiscal lubrication.”', 'The night nurse on duty in the Rookery’s infirmary was a human man, but he shared a lot of features with a particularly venal fox. Not that anybody would ever awaken a fox.', 'Even as we pushed through the doors, he picked up the speaking horn connected to the Rookery’s internal communications system. Cool Charles flapped up onto his desk and put a talon on the man’s hand. “You’ll want to hear this,” he said. “Seriously.”', 'The man eyed the package I set before him speculatively, and put down the speaking horn. “What can I do for you?” he asked. His voice was more like a weasel’s.', '“We’re here to visit Dr. Sedgewick,” I said. “We won’t be long, just a few minutes to check up on his condition.”', '“You’re a doctor?” the man asked doubtfully.', '“Just visitors,” I said.', 'He glanced at a log on his desk. “Orders are that he only be visited by relatives.”', 'I nudged the package toward him. “We’re his cousins,” I said.', 'When we got to the room, Dr. Sedgewick was awake, and apparently well on the mend—he was grading papers. He wielded a double-ended pencil with sharpened blue and red points, quickly marking passages, underlining and circling, scribbling notes. He flipped the pencil back and forth often, utilizing a color code I couldn’t make any sense of at a glance. His head was bandaged, but his eyes were clear.', '“Dr. Sedgewick, my name is Connolly Marsh. This is my colleague, Charles. I’ve been hired by Thomasina Swallow to investigate the circumstances surrounding your injury.”', 'He looked me up and down. “A dog,” he said. “A lying dog.”', '“Excuse me?” I said, genuinely startled.', '“I was warned you might show up,” the man said. “I know all about you, dog. I know you were kicked off the police force and I know why. Well, you’ll not involve me in any of that. I’m a reputable scholar, do you hear me? You trot right along. Go home. Go home!”', 'You run into this kind of talk sometimes. You try not to let it get you down.', '“Come on, Connolly,” said Charles. “Nothing to learn here.”', '“Just a minute.” I took a deep breath, fighting down a growl. “What did they give you?”', 'Sedgewick looked down his pitiful little nose at me. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, and the lie absolutely ', '.', '“Your field is linguistic analysis. Somehow you got hold of an underground pamphlet—maybe somebody paid you to look at it, maybe even somebody I used to work for—and you figured out that the anonymous writer was someone right here in the Rookery, Thomasina Swallow.

And, fool that you are, you forgot who she calls ‘Papa.’”', 'The way these things usually go, the perpetrator or the witness or whoever you’re grilling responds to their misdeeds being laid out for them by blustering or by getting angry or by clamming up. I figured Sedgewick was headed for blustering, but then something odd happened. His eyes clouded over, he picked up his pencil, and he started marking papers again. Then he set the pencil down, looked up, and said, “I was warned you might show up.”', 'Cool Charles pecked my back right paw ', '. “Let’s ', ',” he said. “Before this gets any weirder.”', 'On the way out, I threw a glance back at Sedgewick.

Most of these were overflowing.', '“You check those mailboxes,” I said. “I’m going back to his office.”', 'Behind the secretary’s desk was a warren of cubicles that were probably used by adjuncts, and then a corridor housing the more senior faculty’s offices.

Superficially, the room resembled Thomasina Swallow’s office, except that there was a large casement window behind the desk and there were no stacks of files and papers. The room, in fact, was preternaturally neat.', '“Oh,” I said. “Of course. They’ve been here already.”', 'Cool Charles burst into the room in full, panicked flight, nothing cool about him at all.

He was battering against the window, the ceiling, and the walls, all in turn. I suppressed the urge to bark. “What’s wrong?” I shouted instead. But Charles didn’t answer. “What did you do to him?” I asked the professor.', '“Thomasina,” came a voice from down at floor level. “The windows, if you would.”', 'She rushed past me, sparing me a pitying look, and fumbled with the window latches. Charles fluttered about her hands, banging against the glass. I caught a glimpse of one of his eyes. The intelligence there was strange to me. Frightening.

An outcast learns how fit in at her school and much more in Marko Kloos’s short story “How to Move Spheres and Influence People.”', 'T. K. hates a lot of things, but at the moment, it’s how she becomes the #1 target during dodgeball at gym. Everything changes, however, when she discovers that she has the ace ability to direct spherical objects — and she makes her classmates pay! But her powers are made for more than petty revenge, as she soon discovers while on a family vacation.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The first time it happens, she’s in P.E. class, because of course it has to be P.E.', 'It’s fashionable to hate P.E., and most of the other girls at Mapletree Academy claim they do, but T.K. really doesn’t mind it. It’s only twice a week, and they mostly stick to sports she can do with her one working arm. She knows she could easily get out of P.E. by pulling the Cripple Card (although she never calls it that; her parents and teachers would flinch in horror at her own insensitivity toward ', ', go figure), but she doesn’t because she likes to run around even if she’s not very good at it. She also doesn’t want to give her stuck-up classmates the satisfaction of being able to shoot her pitying glances as she sits on the sidelines and eats Goldfish crackers while doing her math homework. Truth be told: it’s the only time during the week when T.K. doesn’t feel like everyone’s pussyfooting around her disability.', 'They’re playing dodgeball that day, at the end of the class. T.K. is pretty good at it considering she can only use one arm, even if she gets nailed by the ball a little more than the other girls. But this session is a shooting gallery, with her as the target. Again. It’s just two girls who are targeting her specifically—and her left side, too, where she can’t block—but they’re stealthy about it so Mrs. Williams, the P.E. teacher, doesn’t come down on them. For some reason, Brooke MacAllister has decided that if T.K. wants to play with the varsity, she can take the hits too. And for this week, she seems to have recruited Alison Keller to be her wingman, because T.K. is getting targeted fire from two angles. Mapletree has a special version of dodgeball where you have to crank out five push-ups on the spot if you get hit. Mrs. Williams wanted to give her a waiver on the push-ups, but T.K. refused the special treatment. She’s not strong enough for one-armed pushups, but she can do crunches just fine, so she does those instead. And today, she’s doing a lot of crunches courtesy of Brooke and Alison. In the middle of her fifth set, a ball comes in and beans her on the left side of the head just as she is coming up from a crunch.', '“Ow!”', 'T.K. glares in the direction of the ball’s origin and spots Brooke, who gives her a curt and jock-like “Sorry!” without even the slightest tone of apology in her voice. T.K. doesn’t want to make anything of it, so she doesn’t even look for Mrs. Williams, but she has her limits, and Brooke’s attention is starting to poke at the edges of them. She finishes her crunches and gets back up to rejoin the ranks. Another ball shoots past her face, so close that she can practically smell the rubber, and she ducks and flinches. This one came from the other side of the court, from Alison’s direction, but Alison pretends to not notice T.K.’s glare as she conspicuously picks another target. T.K. grabs a ricochet off the gym floor and chucks it at Alison, but it misses her by a foot and smacks into the mats lining the wall behind her. Alison looks over to T.K. and smirks, which only serves to crank up the dial of T.K.’s Pissed-Off-O-Meter another notch. She can’t really complain about them throwing balls at her, because that’s what the game is about. But getting singled out for no good reason takes the fun out of it.', '“One minute,” Mrs. Williams shouts from the sideline. “Wrap it up, ladies!” Then she turns around and checks her cell phone. T.K. groans.', '“Don’t you—” she calls over to Brooke, but Brooke does, and so does Alison. Of course they were waiting for the opportunity for one last cheap shot. Alison’s shot hits T.K.’s right thigh and bounces off. Brooke’s ball comes in a flat arc, and T.K. knows that she’ll take the stupid thing right on the bridge of her nose.', 'That’s when the thing happens.', 'Later, she’ll puzzle about what triggered it. She’s hot and sweaty, angry at Brooke and Alison, hurting from the shot to the bare skin of her leg, and the muscles on her left side, the one with the paralysis, are taut enough to snap, which is what happens when she overexerts herself. But she knows that she feels a swell of fresh anger, and something goes snap in her brain. There’s a hot, trickling sensation, like someone just opened the top of her skull and poured a cup of coffee directly on the back side of her brain and down her spinal column. T.K. raises her hand to keep the ball from hitting her in the face, even though she knows it’s too late for that. But then the strangest sensation follows the hot trickle. She can feel the ball not three feet in front of her face—its roundness, the way it displaces the air around it—and she gives it a tiny little shunt with her mind, and it’s the best feeling she’s ever had, like finally scratching an itch you couldn’t get to for an hour, only a hundred times better. The ball—the one that was about to give her a nosebleed—hooks ever so slightly to the left and whizzes past her left side, close enough to her ear that she can hear it whistling through the air.', 'Nobody notices. T.K. isn’t even sure that Brooke saw the ball didn’t fly true, that it made a little skip at the end of its arc. There are still half a dozen other balls in the air, and there’s a lot of movement and yelling, kids paying attention to throwing or not getting hit. But she is dead sure that she caused that little skip, because she knows that for just that half second, the ball was in her control, and that it went precisely where she had wanted it to go.', '\\xa0', 'They hit the showers and get dressed, and T.K. is too amazed and shaken to seek out Brooke and Alison to bitch at them. Now that P.E. is over, nobody pays attention to her anymore. In the first few weeks after she joined the class, her awkward-looking one-handed maneuver to get back into her bra and shirt got some interest from the other girls in the locker room, but that’s old hat now, and she finishes up and leaves as quickly as she can.', '\\nP.E. was the last class of the day, and now they have an hour of library time before dinner. But T.K. doesn’t feel much like going to the library. Instead, she unloads her backpack at the dorm and then goes back to the gym.', 'She had figured the place to be empty by now, because Mrs. Williams usually leaves on time. But when she walks back in, Mrs. Williams is still there, walking toward the door with a bag on each shoulder.', '“Tilly,” Mrs. Williams says, and T.K. tries not to frown. Most of the teachers address her by her chosen name instead of Tilly, which she hates almost as much as its proper long form, Lintilla. She knows she’s named for a great-grandmother she never even knew, but “Lintilla” sounds like a species of exotic rodent to her. So she was Tilly until she was thirteen, at which point she decided that “T.K.” was edgier than “Tilly Kendall.” Like she’s a New York City spray tagger or a skateboarder instead of a skinny fifteen-year-old redhead from rural Vermont with freckles and left-side hemiparesis. But Mrs. Williams insists on using her actual name, which strikes T.K. as slightly disrespectful.', '“Mrs. W,” she replies. “I, uh, forgot something in the locker room.”', 'It’s a quick and shoddy lie, but Mrs. Williams, loaded down with bags as she is and clearly in a hurry, buys it without trouble. Besides, the gym is always open for the students anyway—there’s a keypad at the door and everyone knows the code, and what kind of trouble can you get into in a school gym?', '“Well, go get it. But make sure the door is latched when you leave, okay? The latch sticks sometimes if you don’t push it shut all the way.”', '“Will do, Mrs. W,” T.K. says. “Have a good evening.”', '“See you tomorrow, Tilly.”', 'T.K. heads toward the girls’ locker room and pauses in the doorway to wait for the “click” of the sticky door latch. Then she turns and goes to the door that leads into the gym. That feeling she had just a little while ago, when she moved that ball away from her face, had been the most wicked rush of her life, and she wants to see if she can repeat it.', 'The balls in the gym are neatly stashed away in nets hanging from the wall on the back of the gym, right next to the equipment lockers. T.K. walks over to one of the nets and pulls it open. She fishes out a ball and tosses it into the middle of the gym, where it bounces a few times and rolls to a stop.', '“Here goes nothing,” T.K. says to herself. Her voice echoes a little in the empty gym.', 'She’s afraid that the moment of total control during the game was a fluke, a one-time thing, some momentary and non-recurring phenomenon, maybe a glitch in her brain. That she’ll stand here in the gym and stare at that ball like an idiot for a bit while nothing happens. But when she concentrates, that control comes back with absurd ease. It’s like looking at the curve of the sphere throws a switch in her mind, one that wasn’t there before. It’s not as strong as it was the first time around, but when she feels the curvature of the ball with whatever new sense her brain has flipped on with that switch, that feeling of deep satisfaction comes back, and she knows that it wasn’t a momentary thing. It feels like she’s holding that sphere in the palm of an invisible hand, one that’s much more strong and limber and precise than her own.', 'T.K. laughs with relief. Then she picks up the ball with her mind and flicks it halfway across the court to the basketball rim on the far end. The ball hits the rim and bounces off. Before it can hit the gym floor, she picks it up again without effort, raises it slowly, and dumps it straight through the hoop.', '“Holy shit,” she says and laughs again.', 'She has superpowers. She’s a damn ', '.', '\\xa0', 'For the next hour, well into dinnertime, T.K. practices in the empty gym. She pitches the ball all over the place, and every time she does, she gets more accurate with it. It’s like her new talent is a muscle that can be made stronger with practice. When she tries to manipulate other things, other shapes, that feeling of control evaporates, almost like the angles on the thing poke through whatever force she uses on the spheres and pops the bubble. But if it’s round, she is in full control of it. She tries one of the heavy medicine balls out of the equipment locker, the ones she can’t even lift with her own physical strength, but with the new power she just turned on, it’s just as easy to throw those as it is to pitch a basketball. She throws the medicine ball around until she gets a little too giddy and tries to slam-dunk it onto the hoop rim. It smacks against the backboard hard enough to make the nearby windows shake, and the crash from the heavy ball on the board is so loud that she’s sure they’ll hear it all the way up in the library. She quickly picks up the medicine ball and moves it back to the equipment shack, before someone can come in and wonder how the partially paralyzed girl managed to move a twenty-five-pound ball ten feet up in the air by herself. Then T.K. tidies up and leaves the gym to head back up the hill to the dorm, with some reluctance.', '\\xa0', 'The next day, T.K. can barely muster the patience to sit through her classes. She was up until three in the morning, playing with tennis balls and marbles in her room, experimenting and chasing that euphoric feeling of control. The tiredness makes the day even longer and more unbearable. She has an idea for the afternoon, and she can’t wait for the clock to hit 3 p.m.', 'When classes are finally over for the day, she rushes back to the dorm to dump her backpack and her books. Then she leaves the school property to go to the mixed-use building that sits just a quarter mile away from campus on the rural road. There’s a country store here and a pizza joint, and the back of the building houses a little post office and a hardware store that’s much bigger than it looks from the outside. T.K. usually comes here to get snacks, just like lots of other Mapletree students, but today the stuff she wants is in the hardware store.', 'The store has quarter-inch ball bearings at seventy cents apiece, individually bagged. She cleans off the whole peg, a dozen bags, and carries them to the register. T.K. has an alibi handy if they want to know why she needs a dozen ball bearings—school science experiments—but she must not look particularly shady, because the clerk rings her up without comment. Then she spots little plastic containers of BBs on the shelf behind the clerk and asks for one of those too, fully expecting to be treated like an aspiring terrorist any second. But the clerk just adds the total to the bill—eight bucks—and bags her stuff for her. She reads the label on the pellet container right before he bags it: 2,400 BBs.', ', she thinks. ', '\\xa0', 'There’s an old abandoned factory half a mile away from Mapletree Academy, dilapidating away on the bank of the Connecticut River. A few of the juniors and seniors sometimes go there to drink, but the place isn’t much of a hangout, littered as it is with old factory debris and broken glass. But it’s away from people, and there’s nothing T.K. can break here that’s not already broken.', 'She brought a twelve-pack of soda from the country store, and for her first experiment, she lines up three cans on a crumbling brick wall in the central yard between the buildings. Then she walks back fifty yards and unbags her ball bearings. They feel weighty and serious, both in her hand and in her mind, when she lifts them one at a time with her power. T.K. expects the first one to drop to the ground when she lifts the second one, but it doesn’t. She grins as she repeats the process, and three quarter-inch ball bearings are floating in the air in front of her.', 'She gives the first one a push, about as much as she pushed the basketball yesterday. It shoots off and knocks the first can off its perch. It lands on the pock-marked concrete with a huge dent in the center. T.K. finds that even at fifty yards, aiming the spheres isn’t difficult at all. She pushes the second ball bearing a little harder than the first. This one streaks across the yard in a blur and punches into the second can dead-center, sending soda spraying everywhere.', 'T.K. concentrates on the last floating ball bearing and pushes it as hard as she can.', 'The third can disintegrates in a spray of soda and aluminum shrapnel. She knows the ball bearing went through the can and into the brick wall of the building twenty yards behind because she can see the puff of brick dust and hear the shattering brick as the bearing cracks it.', '“Whoa,” she murmurs, awed by the power she just unleashed with nothing more than half a second of concentration. She could seriously hurt somebody with this ability, even kill them.', 'T.K. steps up to the brick wall of the building she just shot with her ball bearing. Several of the bricks are cracked from the impact, and one of them is almost completely gone. She can see the hole the bearing made as it passed through. It went right through four inches of brick, and she suspects it also went through the back wall of that building, because that quarter-inch ball of steel was moving fast.', 'She spends half an hour experimenting with the rest of the ball bearings. She target-shoots the rest of the soda cans and finds that she can modulate her power very precisely, right down to the point where she can send a sphere right into a can with just enough power to knock it down without even denting it. Used like this, she can retrieve her ammunition and reuse it instead of having to dig it out of holes in broken bricks.', 'Then T.K. opens the container of BBs. They’re so much tinier and lighter than the ball bearings that it hardly seems she’ll be able to do much with them, no matter how fast she pushes them. So she pours them out on the ground in a pile and then tries to lift as many as she can at once.', 'They all rise like a little silver cloud in front of her—all 2,400 of them.', '“No way!” T.K. laughs.', 'Then she starts playing with them like they’re a flock of birds, moving them in one direction, then another, sideways, up, down. It’s weird—she can feel each individual BB in her mind, but she can move them all as a mass, and it feels almost like she’s manipulating a liquid made of thousands of perfectly spherical little drops. A hundred of those BBs don’t weigh what one of the ball bearings did, but with so many of them in front of her at the same time, she realizes that not much can get through to her if she keeps them moving quickly. She directs the BB cloud into a stream around herself, around and up, then down and up again until it looks like she’s the vortex of a metallic tornado. The BBs move so fast that she can’t make them out individually anymore. They’re just a blur of flashing silver.', ', she thinks. ', 'And then, on a whim, she wants to see if her power is divided among all those BBs evenly, or if each of them pushes off with the same speed as the ball bearing before, regardless of the number of spheres. And these BBs are tiny and lightweight, and ', ' So she focuses on the cloud of spheres swirling all around her and pushes out with all her might, shoves them in all directions. They explode out from around her in a flashing ring of polished steel.', 'The result is instant and terrifying. T.K. hears glass breaking and brick cracking all around her, and for a moment she thinks she killed herself with her new powers, like a complete idiot. There’s brick dust in the air, and as she stands there, cowering with her right arm over her head, it settles on her clothing and the ground in front of her.', 'She looks up and takes a sharp breath. All the way around the yard, the walls look like someone just blasted them with the world’s largest shotgun, thousands of little holes bored into the brickwork, whatever glass was remaining in the window frames blown out and pulverized.', '“Let’s not try that again,” she murmurs to herself.', 'It’s kind of sobering to know that she can turn herself into a living shrapnel grenade with nothing but an eight-dollar container of BBs. That’s more easy destructive power than she—than anyone—should be allowed to control.', 'But still, even as cowed as she is by her own display of sphere mayhem, she takes two of the quarter-inch ball bearings and sticks them into the pocket of her jeans as she packs up to go back to Mapletree. After all, you never know when you might need a sphere-shaped object handy in an emergency, and she won’t always have a hardware store nearby when she needs one.', '\\xa0', 'The next day is a Thursday, which means P.E. again.', 'T.K. goes into the inevitable round of dodgeball at the end with a live-and-let-live attitude. If it hadn’t been for Brooke trying to cream her with a ball two days ago, she wouldn’t have discovered what she can do. Or maybe it would have come out of her at some other time. But she’s willing to forgive and forget, if Brooke and Alison don’t pick her for target practice again.', 'But whatever chip Brooke has on her shoulder this week, it’s still there today. T.K. makes it three minutes until Mrs. W has to take a call on her cell. And sure enough—five seconds after Mrs. W turns her back, a ball comes zooming at T.K. from where Brooke and Alison are playing side by side today. Brooke isn’t even hiding that she took that shot. She grins at T.K., who gets smacked on her bare thigh again, in almost exactly the spot the other ball landed two days ago.', 'T.K. doesn’t shout at them to cut it the hell out. She just drops for her five crunches. But even as she does, she keeps an eye on Alison, because she knows that Alison isn’t the sharpest crayon in the box and probably thinks she can plant another one while T.K. is crunching away.', 'Alison takes her shot right as T.K. finishes the last crunch. T.K. knows that both girls are watching her, and that she can’t pull the same sort of last-ditch save she performed on Tuesday. So she takes the ball to the side of her head on purpose. It’s just a glancing blow, but it clips her ear and hurts, and she yelps involuntarily. Alison and Brooke, satisfied with their strafing run, turn their attention away again.', '“All right then,” T.K. says. She picks up the ball that bounced off her head. Then she chucks it at the spot where Alison and Brooke are standing, and gives it more push and a more precise direction with her new power.', 'The gym is noisy, and there’s lots of crossfire, so nobody notices the utterly perfect path the ball takes. It flies a foot or more past Brooke’s head, who whips her head around and smirks at her as if to congratulate her for the missed shot. But as soon as the ball has passed Brooke’s peripheral vision, T.K. accelerates it and makes it bounce off the wall right behind her head. The deflection is implausible for the angle of the throw, but not impossible, and nobody notices anyway. The ball smacks into the back of Brooke’s head, and it’s just the right angle and momentum to bounce off her skull and hit Alison in the side of the head as well.', 'Brooke takes the brunt of that hit. T.K. swears she can hear her teeth slam together from the impact even across the noisy gym. Brooke goes to her knees. Next to her, Alison just lets out an indignant “', '” and then looks at Brooke, pissed off, as if her friend had chucked that ball from half a foot away.', 'T.K. almost laughs. She can do this over and over until both of them are tired of the game and leave her alone. But she can’t help but feel a little bit of concern for Brooke, who’s still on her knees and looking dazed, even though T.K. knows that she calibrated the pitch enough to not rattle that girl’s cage too hard.', ', T.K. thinks and looks away.', 'And then a small voice in her head chimes in.', ', it says, and it chills her to the bone.', 'And right then and there she resolves to only use that power on people when she absolutely needs to. It’s too much, and it’s not right to use it for frivolities like a high school tiff with a stuck-up rich girl who will have forgotten T.K.’s name two days after graduation. And then, despite it all or maybe because of it, she walks over to Brooke to make sure she’s all right.', '\\xa0', 'Here’s the thing about Mapletree: everyone who goes there is pretty much by definition a rich kid. The tuition is fifty grand a year, and there are no scholarships. But T.K. doesn’t consider herself one of the rich girls because her allowance is small, and her parents didn’t send her to boarding school with a wallet full of credit cards. At the beginning of the holiday break, however, there’s no denying that she’s from a loaded family. The parking lot in front of the gym looks like an exotic car dealership on pick-up day as all the parents are trying to out-Porsche and out-Benz each other.', 'Her mom and dad come by precisely twice a year—when they come to pick T.K. up for the summer break, and when they take her home for the holidays. That’s when the big ceremonies for the parents take place. It’s graduation in June, and the holiday concert in December, everyone dressed up and watching all the grades perform. T.K. supposes that when you shell out that much tuition money, you want to see caps and gowns and hear some uplifting display of liberal arts education at least twice a year. Mapletree doesn’t teach any one-handed instruments, so T.K. sings in the choir, which is much more fun than she had expected. The grades do their performances to lightning storms of camera flashlights, a darkened gym full of middle-aged parents all holding up phones like they’re at a concert. Then there’s the milling and hand-shaking at the end, and then they are released for the holiday break, a whole week sandwiched between two long weekends.', '“How was your trimester, sweetie?” her mom asks from the front seat as they are driving the fifty miles back home to Casa Kendall.', 'For a moment, T.K. thinks about answering truthfully. ', ' She tries to suppress a grin when she imagines that scenario and mostly fails, which her mother takes entirely the wrong way.', '“That well, huh?” her mom says and winks knowingly. “Is he a junior or senior?”', 'T.K. only catches on after a second. Her mom thinks she’s smiling about a ', '. As if the whole school didn’t have only two hundred students, less than half of them boys, none of whom are exactly falling over themselves to romance the only girl on campus with an obvious handicap. Not when all the other girls are well-bred, pretty, and with left arms that don’t hang by their sides like recently broken wings.', '“Neither, Mom,” T.K. answers. It’s not exactly a lie, after all, and her mom takes the evasiveness as cute embarrassment.', '“Playing your cards close, I see. Well, I’m glad the trimester was fun for you.”', '“Where are we going for the holidays?” T.K. asks, mostly to change the subject. Dad always takes them out of the country for the holiday week as a treat. Last year it was Montreal, and the year before they went on a cruise and then stayed in Puerto Rico for three days.', '“Edinburgh,” her father says from the driver’s seat. “Do some Christmas shopping in the old town, see the lights, have some good food. What do you think?”', '“Sounds awesome,” she says and gives her dad a thumbs-up. Then she sits back in her seat and thinks about the upcoming holidays. If she does the job while her parents aren’t watching, hanging all the ornaments on the tree should be super easy this year.', '\\xa0', 'They head to Edinburgh for their usual holiday week fun rituals: shopping, restaurant meals, and enough sightseeing to fill the memory card on her dad’s camera even though they’ve been here half a dozen times at least already. Edinburgh is pretty, especially the old town, which is aglow with Christmas lights everywhere, and it takes T.K. no time at all to get into the holiday spirit when snow starts falling on the evening of their first stay.', 'On the morning of their second day in Edinburgh, T.K. is out by herself to get Christmas presents for her mom and dad, who are off doing their own thing. Dad’s having brunch with an old medical school buddy of his, and mom is getting a massage back at the hotel spa. There’s a huge Christmas market set up on George Street, a rustic village of hundreds of booths and vendor stalls. T.K. spends the morning browsing the rows of merchants and taking in the sights and sounds. By lunchtime, she has converted most of her pocket money into gifts and trinkets for her friends. It’s not bitingly cold, but the two hot chocolates from the beverage stalls have worn off, and T.K. is ready to head back to the hotel to stash her purchases and get some lunch.', 'At the end of George Street, there’s a big, park-like square. It’s a wide expanse of grass surrounded by a perimeter of trees and a high wrought-iron fence. T.K. is about to cross the street and walk through the park to get to the hotel when she hears a commotion on the other side of the square, screeching tires and then a loud metallic crash. The pigeons on that end of the park take to the sky seemingly all at once. T.K.’s first thought is that someone just had a bad traffic accident. Around her, heads are turning toward the noise. Then there’s a second crash, louder than the first one, and then she spots the source of the commotion. A delivery truck has knocked down a section of the iron fence on that side of the park. As T.K. watches, the truck drags part of the fence with it into the park square. There are people walking on the garden pathways of the park, and they are dashing out of the way of the truck now, shouting in alarm.', 'Everything happened so quickly that T.K. hasn’t even had time to get scared yet. After a morning of Christmas lights and warm drinks and cheery holiday mood, the scene unfolding just a hundred yards in front of her seems surreal and out of place. T.K. stands rooted to the sidewalk at the end of George Street, transfixed by the sight of the delivery truck bulling its way across the neatly manicured park, while people around her gape or shout or rush to get out of the street. The truck swerves to avoid the huge statue standing right in the center of the park. As it does, the piece of fencing it was dragging comes loose and clatters against the statue’s plinth with a thunderous racket that reverberates across the park.', 'Three police officers come dashing down George Street and past T.K., shouting at people to get out of the way. They run toward the edge of the park and the approaching truck. Now the crowd really starts moving, as if the appearance of the police makes the danger official and concrete. T.K. glances back down George Street, which is still packed with holiday shoppers. The end of the street is blocked off to traffic, but the barriers are just orange-and-white plastic blocks with hip-high metal fencing at the top.', 'Two of the police officers try to block the truck as it approaches the gap in the park’s perimeter fence where the walkway lets out onto the street where T.K. is standing. They wave their arms and shout at the driver, who pays them no mind. The officers jump out of the way when the truck reaches the gap, which isn’t quite wide enough. The front of the truck, already dented and scraped from the previous collision, smashes into the iron fencing and knocks it aside. The truck’s forward momentum is slowed down briefly by the barrier, but the truck’s driver revs the engine and starts to push through.', 'Up until now, T.K. thought it may have been an accident, or maybe a medical emergency. But then she sees the face of the driver through the windshield of the truck. He doesn’t look like he’s scared or in distress. His face is all wide-eyed focus, so devoid of obvious emotion that it almost looks like there’s a department store mannequin behind the wheel. He steers the truck slightly to the right, then to the left again, to shunt the sections of fencing aside that are scraping along the side of the truck’s cabin. One of the policemen jumps up onto the running board on the driver’s side and hammers a baton against the window. The driver opens the door abruptly and forcefully, and the police officer goes flying and lands on the sidewalk.', 'T.K. doesn’t consciously decide to act. She just looks at the people crowding the street behind her and the truck that’s about to drive right into them in a few moments, and there’s no way for her to get all those people out of the way, no way to stop that truck in its tracks. But there are hundreds of decorated Christmas trees all the way down George Street, and almost every stall and vendor booth is festooned with decorations as well. And so many of them are globe-shaped ornaments.', 'Without thinking about it, T.K. drops her shopping bags, reaches out with her good hand, and lets that newly awakened part of her mind pull every round holiday ornament in sight toward her.', 'It sounds like a thousand birds taking off all at once. All the way down the street, people shout and yell as trees rustle and sway, and a multicolored swarm of glass and plastic spheres rises into the cold winter air and speeds toward the truck just as the driver has managed to break all the way through the fence. The ornaments are bigger and much lighter than the ball bearings she has been using for practice. T.K. tries to keep control of them all, but they are so light, and there are so many of them, that the light breeze blowing over George Street is enough to make her lose her grip on many of them. It’s like trying to hold on to a handful of powdery sand. Dozens of the ornaments fall out of the swarm and bounce or shatter on the street, careen off vendor stall roofs, or bop people in the head. But she manages to hold on to most of them, and there are a lot, many hundreds, maybe thousands. T.K. hurls the stream of colored orbs against the front of the truck, where they start to shatter in little silver-bright explosions.', 'The ornaments have almost no mass, and they burst against the front of the truck and its windshield without doing damage, spraying glittering fragments of glass and plastic. But the cloud of ornaments T.K. has yanked loose from their trees and light chains has so much volume that dozens of them smash into the windshield every second, a flurry of green and red and silver shards that envelops the front of the truck like a cloud and obscures the driver’s vision completely. The truck starts swerving. For a heart-stopping moment, it heads right for T.K., who redoubles her mental efforts. Then the driver swerves back to the right, over-corrects, and clips one of the traffic control barriers. The left front wheel of the delivery truck hits the corner of the barrier, and the truck jolts with the shock of the impact. It careens further to the right, bounces onto the sidewalk, and crashes into the front of the house on the other side of the street.', 'T.K. releases her hold on all the spheres that are still in the air. They fall to the ground, once again beholden only to gravity, and for a few moments, it’s raining Christmas ornaments all over George Street. Maybe five seconds have passed since she started pulling the spheres with her mind and steering them toward the truck, but she feels like she has just run a track relay all by herself.', 'The policemen run up to the truck’s cabin. One of them jumps up on the sideboard again and yanks on the door handle. The door flies open with a bang, so forcefully that one of the hinges pops off. The policeman jumps out of the way at the last instant, and the weight of the door bends the other hinge as well and makes the door flip forward and hit the ground with a shriek of tortured metal. The driver jumps out of the cab and onto the sidewalk, and T.K. lets out a shocked gasp. He’s a joker—or whatever they call those in this country. Taller than the biggest of the policemen by at least a head, he is bare-chested, and a set of leathery wings is protruding from his back. But that’s not even the most joker-like thing about him. Out of his chest, T.K. sees two extra vestigial arms protruding, each with three long fingers that end in sharp-looking claws. He grabs the nearest policeman by the front of his bulletproof vest, lifts him off his feet, and throws him backwards. The second policeman swings his baton and hits the joker on the side of the head. The joker almost goes to his knees. Then he whips his arm around and returns the blow with a backhand from his left arm. He’s much stronger than the policeman, who takes the hit to the side of his head and bounces off the delivery truck’s cabin only to crumple to the pavement.', 'The joker looks around, fury in his face. He yells something, but his Scottish accent is so thick that T.K. can’t make out what he’s saying. Then his gaze locks on her, and the fury turns to naked hatred in his expression. He gets up from the half-crouch the cop had beaten him into with his baton, and strides toward her. The wings on his back unfold with a little shudder and then pop out to their full extension. They are leathery like a bat’s, and they make him look like a gargoyle or a demon from a comic book. She freezes in wide-eyed fear.', 'Then it’s the joker’s turn to get wide-eyed. He bellows a strangled scream and falls to his knees. Behind him, the last standing police officer is aiming a small black gun-looking thing at the back of the joker. She can see two little wires coming from the device and reaching all the way to the joker’s back, to a spot right between his wings. Whatever the policeman is doing to him must hurt, but it doesn’t seem to hurt enough to keep him down. He twitches a bit and rolls around, and his big leathery wings make an awful soft scraping sound on the pavement of the sidewalk. Then he reaches back and yanks the little wires right out of his back. The policeman fumbles with his little black taser thingie, but the joker is getting to his feet again, and T.K. can see that whatever the cop is doing won’t be done in time.', 'She only realizes that she took her two ball bearings out of her pocket when they are floating above her palm and in front of her eyes already. The joker has his back turned to her as he is advancing on the remaining police officer, who is retreating and yelling into his radio.', 'T.K. doesn’t want to kill the guy. She doesn’t even want to hurt him. But she does want to keep him from hurting anyone else, and this is the only thing she has right now that will make a difference in time. She focuses on the ball bearings above her palm.', ', she reminds herself, remembering the holes she bored clean through bricks with these things not too long ago. ', 'She lets the first one go, but even as it flies toward the joker, she knows that she went a little too light on this shot. The ball bearing hits the joker square in the back of the head. He stumbles and goes to one knee, but catches himself and gets up just as the police officer tries to take advantage of the situation. The policeman tries to use his baton again, but the joker snatches it away from him and throws it aside. Then he grabs the policeman and flings him backwards. The officer crashes into the wall of the house behind him and slumps to the ground.', 'The joker turns around and glares at T.K. He bares his teeth and tenses his body like someone about to launch into a fifty-yard dash. She doesn’t take the time to think about how to calibrate her next shot. She only has one ball bearing left, and there’s no time to look around to see where the other one bounced. So she gives it a harder push than before and lets it fly.', 'The little silver steel orb hits the joker right in the middle of his forehead. This time, she can hear the dull thud of the impact from twenty yards away. And this time, the joker doesn’t just go to his knees. He collapses to the pavement like T.K. has just turned off his main power switch. His wings splay out on the sidewalk, and then he lies still.', 'Sounds come rushing back to her brain like an aural flood. There are sirens everywhere now, and people are shouting and talking all around her. Three more police cars come screaming around the corner, sirens blaring and lights flashing. T.K.’s knees are shaking. She feels like all her energy has drained from her in the last few minutes.', 'There are police converging on this intersection from all directions now. Someone grabs her shoulder and shouts something at her, but it’s like her brain has temporarily lost the ability to understand English. She can’t take her eyes off the joker who’s lying motionless on the pavement twenty yards in front of her, his wings draped over his body like a shroud.', 'Then one of the wings twitches a little. She sees a hand rising, then an arm. The joker tries to push himself up or roll on his side, but he doesn’t get far because at least half a dozen police officers descend on him and pin him down. But he’s alive. She knocked him out, maybe cracked his skull, but she didn’t kill him.', 'T.K.’s legs give out, and she sits down hard on the cold pavement. Then she bursts into tears.', '\\xa0', 'What was supposed to be a three-day trip to Scotland ends up turning into a week-long event. After Edinburgh, it seems like everyone in the country with a badge or a government ID wants to talk to T.K. Everyone is super nice to her, but she’s still having to go to various places guarded by men in uniform who are carrying guns, and she never once has the feeling that all these talks are optional.', 'Her parents are dumbfounded to find out that their handicapped daughter is basically a superhero now. At first, T.K. is worried that her dad is going to ground her until college. But when he sees that everyone seems grateful for T.K.’s intervention and amazed at her ability, T.K. can tell that he enjoys basking in the positive attention by proxy a little.', 'After a few days of interviews and unceasing attention, T.K. is kind of over the whole thing. She’s tired, both in mind and body. Whatever she did in Edinburgh took as much out of her as finals week in school. And when they spend the last day before their return home in London, she gets nervous every time she hears a car horn or the squealing of tires. The cops tell her that she just knocked the joker terrorist out—only they call him a “knave” instead of a joker here—and she is glad to know that she didn’t hurt him permanently or end his life because then she knows she’d never use her ability again. But when she falls asleep in her hotel bed in the evening before the return flight, she sees the angry grimace of the truck’s driver in her dreams, that twisted expression of fury directed at her, and she wakes up with her heart pounding in her chest and doesn’t close her eyes again for the rest of the night.', '\\xa0', 'Her first inkling that life at home isn’t going to be normal again comes when they arrive back in Boston. Before they even get to the immigrations check, three uniformed police officers and two men in dark suits wait for T.K. and her parents on the jetway right outside the plane’s door. There’s some hushed commotion behind them because the flight attendants are making everyone wait until T.K. and her folks have deplaned first. She feels uncomfortable with this unexpected attention, and when they grab their carry-on bags and leave the plane, she feels like she has done something wrong. But everyone is cordial and professional. They lead the Kendalls into a quiet room away from all the bustle, and all they want is to have a chat with her about what happened in Scotland, and for her to show them her ability again. They have donuts and coffee, and they’re just as friendly as the cops in Scotland, but once again T.K. has the distinct impression that this isn’t optional, that she wouldn’t be able to just say “no, thank you” and walk out of the room. So she spends two hours with her parents and the cops in yet another boring conference room and retells the same story for the fiftieth time this week. Finally, the men in the dark suits thank her and let them go through immigrations and customs, and T.K. is relieved right up until the point where they walk into the international arrivals hall and see about two hundred camera lenses aimed at them. A crowd of reporters is waiting in ambush, and the flashes that go off when T.K. and her parents walk through the sliding doors leave no doubt about who they’re here to see.', '“Can we go back to check-in and fly somewhere else?” she says to her dad, even though she’s bone-tired and wants nothing more than to go home and crash in her own room and on her own bed. “Like, Antarctica maybe?”', 'Her father replies with a chuckle, but from the expression on his face, she can see that he’s at least considering the idea a little bit.', '\\xa0', '“Absolutely ', ',” her dad barks into the phone downstairs for what seems like the tenth time today. “She’s fifteen years old, and she has to go to school on Monday.”', 'At first, the constant barrage of calls and stream of people at the door were amusing to T.K., but the novelty has worn off very quickly. She has been holed up in her room since they got back from Scotland while her parents have been fielding reporter questions and interview requests. Every morning newscast in the country suddenly wants to talk to T.K., and so far her dad has shot down every request. But the phone hasn’t stopped ringing even though Casa Kendall has an unlisted number, and T.K. has no idea how she is supposed to make it to school while there are news crews camped out on their street.', '“So you basically suck for not telling me about this earlier,” Ellie says over the phone. Ellie has been T.K.’s best friend since kindergarten—their families have been friends since T.K. and Ellie were toddlers—and Ellie is one of the few callers who makes it through the mom-and-dad screening vanguard today.', '“I didn’t know until, like, two months ago, I swear,” T.K. says.', '“You found out at ', '?”', '“Yeah. In the middle of gym class.”', 'T.K. gives Ellie the condensed version of the week her card turned, leaving out the part where she accidentally found out that she’s basically a walking weapon of mass destruction now.', '“That’s insane,” Ellie says. “I saw the news story. The stuff you did in Europe. You’re gonna be a rock star at school. You saved people.”', '“I don’t know about rock star. More like freak show, probably. Like I wasn’t sticking out enough already.”', 'The thought of returning to Mapletree with her new abilities known to everyone makes T.K. feel queasy. But the cat is out of the bag, and there’s no stuffing it back in, not after cell phone camera footage of her from eight different angles showed up on television screens all over the world a few days ago.', '“Can you come over?” T.K. asks. “I’d say let’s go out to the Creamery and get some monster sundaes, but my folks won’t let me within twenty feet of the front door.”', '“Tell you what,” Ellie replies. “You show me your new superpower thing, and I’ll come over with a half-gallon of Moose Tracks and two spoons.”', 'T.K. laughs, relieved that at least some things are still the way they were last week, back when she was just a high school girl with a busted wing to everyone.', '\\xa0', 'Thirty minutes later, Ellie walks into T.K.’s room and plops herself down on the bed. She has a grocery bag in her hand, which she puts on T.K.’s nightstand.', '“There are six news vans out in the street right in front of your house. This has gotta be the most exciting thing that has ever happened here. They practically peed themselves with excitement when my dad pulled into your driveway.”', 'T.K. groans and drops onto the bed face-first next to Ellie.', '“I’ll never be able to leave the house again,” she says into her pillow.', '“They’ll go away sooner or later. Or you could just go and talk to them, you know. It’s not like you did something terrible.”', 'T.K. sits up again and eyes the plastic bag on her nightstand.', '“You saw the whole thing on TV?”', '“Who didn’t. It’s been on the local news for days now. They kept replaying the footage.”', 'Ellie opens the bag and takes out a half-gallon container of ice cream.

Like they just found out that their daughter’s best friend is secretly moonlighting as a rock star.”', 'T.K. wants to keep up the indignation, but she has to admit that Ellie’s report pleases her. She was worried how her friends and family would react, but so far everyone is interested and even excited about her new ability. She feels like she just won the multi-state lottery jackpot. Even her parents, put out as they were by the sudden media siege and the disruption of their regular lives, had reacted with wide-eyed amazement when she demonstrated her powers to them. She wonders if everyone’s reactions would have been the same if her card turned joker instead, but she knows the anthropological interest and slightly repulsed fascination with which her father reads the occasional features on New York City’s Jokertown in ', '. No, she concludes almost instantly. Things wouldn’t have felt like a lotto win if she had started sprouting tentacles or horns or something.', 'They make it through half the container before Ellie puts down her spoon and looks at T.K. expectantly.', '“Well? I held up my end of the bargain. Now let’s see what you can do.”', '“I thought you saw that on the news already.”', '“That’s different,” Ellie says. “Come on, don’t back out now. I ran the camera gauntlet for you with that ice cream.”', '“Fair enough,” T.K. demurs, secretly excited about having an excuse to pull the ball bearings out of the pocket of her jeans.', 'Ellie flinches a little when T.K. opens her hand and lets the ball bearings float above her palm. Then her friend leans in closer to look at the glossy orbs circling each other slowly, making orbits around a common center of gravity like a miniature binary star. T.K. has been practicing plenty since Edinburgh, and she has honed her fine control over the last few days. Turns out it’s harder to move the balls in a slow and tightly controlled path than it is to fling them somewhere quickly or with a lot of force. Moving heavy stuff or shooting bricks require effort, but fine control takes concentration, and the more precise she wants to be, the more she has to focus.', 'Ellie watches as T.K. makes the ball bearings in her hand spin around each other, first slow and then faster, until they’re just a chrome blur. Then she slows them down again and sends them zooming around the room. She makes a low pass of her desk with one of the bearings, but misjudges the flight path a little. The ball bearing taps against the edge of her desk lamp’s metal arm and knocks it over with a clatter.', '“Whoops,” T.K. says. Ellie just watches, mouth agape, as T.K. brings the errant ball bearing under control again and lets the orbs resume their formation-flying.', '“You’re doing that with your ', '?”', '“Yeah,” T.K. replies. “Pretty awesome, huh?”', 'Ellie holds out a hand, and T.K. steers one of the ball bearings over and drops it gently into the center of Ellie’s palm.', '“Heavy,” Ellie says. She bounces the ball bearing on her palm and turns it with her fingertips. “How fast can you make those things go?”', '“Pretty fast,” T.K. says, intentionally vague because she doesn’t want to give Ellie the idea that she’s dangerous now. “I still have to be able to see what I’m moving, though, so not that fast.”', 'She’s fibbing a little, of course—while she needs to be able to see the sphere to get its movement started, she can push it so fast and so hard that it instantly goes out of her control, like a bullet fired from a gun. But that’s something that she will keep to herself for the moment.', '“So what are you going to do now?” Ellie asks. “I mean, you’re an ace. Everyone knows about it. You’re going to go back to school like nothing happened?”', '“Yeah. I mean, what else am I supposed to do? Put on a spandex leotard and go fight crime?”', '“You’re going to get your diploma. And then you’re off to college. When the whole country knows your face. And what you can do.” Ellie looks at her with a skeptical little smirk.', '“Yeah,” T.K. repeats. “And famous people go to college all the time. Actors and stuff. If they can do it, I should be fine.” She scoops out a big spoon of ice cream from the now half-empty tub.', '“Besides,” she says around a mouthful of Norwich Creamery Moose Tracks. “It’s not like they’ll mob me for autographs before gym class. I’m nobody.”', '“Right.” Ellie waves her own spoon vaguely in the direction of T.K.’s bedroom window. “And nobody has camera crews from all the major networks laying siege to her house.”', 'Then Ellie uses her spoon like she’s holding a ruler and sizing T.K.’s measurements up.', '“Speaking of spandex leotards—we need to design a costume for you.

But T.K. can tell that the headmaster is done with them, and that her dad’s protests and attempts at negotiation are going to extend this unpleasant business, and she is relieved when her father finally gives up and takes himself and his checkbook out of the room in a huff. T.K. trails him out of the school office and into the parking lot. Her schoolmates are going to classes, alone and in small groups, catching up with each other after the holiday break, and she has never felt so shut out in her life. She skipped right from disabled to too-abled, without getting to spend any time in between at just ', '.', '\\xa0', '“We were thinking about a different school anyway,” T.K.’s dad tells her on the way home. “There are lots of great places in the area. Your mom really likes that boarding school in Quebec, the one with the houses and the school ties.”', 'T.K. is sad and angry, and her father’s forced cheerfulness doesn’t help. She has no interest in thinking about a new school right now, with the sudden and complete separation from Mapletree still hurting like a razor cut. She didn’t even have time to say goodbye to anyone. But she doesn’t talk to her dad about her feelings. He’s well-meaning, but he’d misdiagnose the problem and try to apply the wrong solution. In his world, everything can be fixed by writing a big enough check, and this isn’t something money can mend. It’s easy to make him think he’s helping, though.', '“I’ll think about it,” she tells him. “Do you think you could take me over to the Powerhouse and let me hang out there for an hour or two? I don’t want to deal with the cameras at the house right now.”', '“Oh, sure, honey.” From his expression, she can tell he’s relieved that she is speaking in a language he understands. “I can drop you off and go see the accountant for a bit. Tax time is coming up, after all.”', 'He gets his wallet out of the inside pocket of his sport coat and fishes out a credit card without taking his eyes off the road.', '“Here. Use this one if you want to get a few things. Just don’t buy a new car or anything.”', '“Not likely,” she replies and returns his smile. But when she thinks about it, buying a little convertible and pointing it west isn’t the worst plan of action she can think of right now, and if she had her license already, she knows she’d at least consider it.', '\\xa0', 'Their rich little town has an expensive little mall. It’s a converted old powerhouse, renovated at great expense to look like something out of Victorian England, two levels of cute little shops along an indoor concourse lined with hardwood and decorated with lots of wrought iron. This early, most of the shops aren’t open yet, but there’s a cozy little cafe on the ground floor where T.K. can wait for ten o’clock to roll around.', 'She’s halfway through her vanilla chai latte and picking at her blueberry scone when a magenta-haired girl walks into the cafe. The girl looks around, spots T.K., and heads straight for her table. At this time of day, most of the patrons in the cafe are blue-hairs from the nearby retirement village, so the girl walking T.K’s way sticks out even more than she usually would. She stops in front of T.K.’s table, pulls out a chair, and sits down without asking. She’s definitely past high school age, but that brightly colored pixie cut and her goth outfit make her look like she doesn’t want to be a grown-up just yet. As she sits down and scoots the chair closer to the table, T.K. spots a golden nose stud.', '“Hi,” the girl says. “You are Lintilla Kendall.”', 'T.K. makes a face.', '“It’s T.K. Or Tilly, if you don’t do the initials thing. I haven’t been ', ' since preschool.”', '“T.K. I’m Simone. Simone Duplaix.” The girl holds out her hand. She’s wearing a bunch of bracelets on her wrist, and they jingle softly as T.K. accepts the handshake almost automatically.', '“Nice to meet you,” Simone says. Her English has a charming French accent that somehow matches her inoffensively cute appearance perfectly.', '“', ',” T.K. guesses, and Simone nods.', '“', ' I see you took French in school. Very good.”', '“Wait, I think I’ve heard of you. You’re one of the Canadian aces.” T.K. looks around in the cafe to see if anyone’s head has turned their way, but the mostly old folks are sipping their coffees and talking to each other without paying any attention to them.', '“They call me ', ',” Simone says, with dramatic effect in her voice on the last word. “I can blind people for a while. Like they are caught in a, how do you say, ', '? It is a good talent, but it is not quite as good as yours, I think. I watched the news footage. What you did, it was very impressive.”', 'T.K. squirms a little in her seat, but she doesn’t try to protest the compliment. It’s the first time someone has said something unequivocally positive about her new talent. In truth, it pleases her a great deal, even if the memories of that day still twist her stomach.', '“How did you know where to find me?” she asks.', '“Oh, the place where I work, we have ways of tracking people. And you have been in the news lately quite a bit, no? It was not hard to find you.”', 'Simone glances around the room poignantly, leans across the table, and lowers her voice a bit.', '“You need to keep that in mind, after what you did in Europe, T.K. Now that everyone knows what you can do. You don’t know yet what things are like for people like us in the world. There are jokers who already resent you for what you did. And there are many people who will want what you have.”', 'T.K. looks at the café patrons again. The people sitting at their tables and drinking their coffees are still the same ones that were here before Simone walked in, but now T.K. feels anxious and a little afraid. The ball bearings in her pocket are a comforting weight, but she’s still only a fifteen-year-old girl with a physical handicap and no talent or stomach for fighting. ', ' When did her life turn into a bad international mystery thriller?', '“I got kicked out of school today,” she says glumly. “They think I am dangerous.”', '“Well, of course you are,” Simone says.', '“But I’m ', ',” T.K. protests. “I’m still the same person. I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just want to go back to the way things were.”', 'Simone looks at her with unconcealed pity and shakes her head with a little sigh.', '“Oh, ', '. Your old life? That is over. From now on, when you meet new people and they know what you are, they will either want something from you, or they will be afraid of you.”', '“Really? And which kind are you?”', 'It comes out a little snippier than T.K. had intended, but Simone just smiles.', '“Well, I am not afraid of you,” she says.', '“So what do you want from me?”', 'Simone reaches into the pocket of the leather jacket she’s wearing and takes out a business card, which she puts facedown on the table right next to the plate that has the rest of T.K.’s blueberry scone on it.', '“I ', ' you to think about your future. About what you will do with this talent of yours. You will find that it opens a lot of doors for you. But you will have to decide which of those doors you want to step through.”', 'T.K. picks up the business card and flips it over to read it.', '“I work for the Committee,” Simone says. “The Committee on Extraordinary Interventions. You may have heard of it.”', '“You work for the government?”', '“Not for a government. We work for the United Nations, for all governments. People like you and me. Aces and joker-aces, keeping the peace. Helping out where we can with our talents.”', '“I’m ', ',” T.K. says. “I can’t work for the United Nations yet. My parents won’t even let me get a summer job at the gelato place.”', '“But you will be eighteen before too long, no?”', 'Simone nods at the business card T.K. is still holding.', '“Maybe in a few years, if you decide you want to use your talent for a good cause, we can show you the sort of things we do. Until then, we just want you to know that we are around. So call me or send me a message if you need help. Or if you just want to talk. You know, with someone who knows what it’s like.”', '“I’ll think about it,” T.K. says. She would laugh at the ludicrousness of the situation if she wasn’t so overwhelmed by it all. If she hadn’t gotten kicked out of school this morning, she’d be back in P.E. right now, and she’s reasonably sure that Brooke and Alison wouldn’t throw any balls within fifty feet of her ever again. But instead of doing crunches while thinking about lunch hour and afternoon science lab, she has the United Nations and international intrigue swirling around in her head, and that’s not a leap her brain is willing to make right now. Her face must show some of the stress she’s feeling, because Simone reaches across the table and squeezes her hand lightly.', '“When you did what you did in Europe, it was like you threw a rock into a pond, T.K. It started making ripples. You do nothing, the water will smooth out again, eventually. But you know what you can also do?”', '“What’s that?”', '“Start throwing in bigger rocks,” Simone says. “Turn the ripples into waves.”', '\\xa0', 'When T.K. leaves the cafe half an hour later, she’s in a better mood. Getting expelled from school still hurts because it makes her feel like she’s done something wrong, that she’s being punished. But when she thinks about her future now, it’s no longer indistinct and scary.', 'On the drive home with her dad, she imagines herself like Simone: dyed hair, nose stud, running around in some exciting foreign city like Tokyo or London, using her new ace powers in the service of the Committee. ', ', she thinks.', '\\xa0', 'That evening, T.K. sits down with her parents in the living room to talk about school stuff. The way they are accommodating her right now, they must think she’s devastated about getting kicked out of Mapletree. T.K. chooses to reaffirm their parental instincts by telling them how unfair she thinks the whole thing is, which is absolutely true. She doesn’t tell them about her meeting with Simone today, or about the fact that unlike them, she was never really fully in love with that school anyway. But when your parents have dropped fifty grand a year in tuition for two years running, that kind of information would probably be unwelcome, and she feels like she should keep it on a need-to-know basis for now.', 'While they are looking through high-gloss brochures for half a dozen other private high schools, her dad is sort of half-watching the hockey game that’s playing on low volume on the living room TV. T.K. has her back to the screen, so she doesn’t see what’s going on in the game. She’s reading through the list of offered sports at one of the interchangeable prep schools her parents have picked out—most of which require two functioning arms, naturally—when her dad lets out a suppressed cheer and pumps his fist.', '“Really, honey? ', '?” T.K.’s mom scolds him. “We’re looking at schools now, dear. Can’t you turn that off?”', 'T.K. turns to see what spiked her dad’s excitement. They’re showing the replay of the goal now. One of the players stops the puck with his stick and then does a sort of vertical roundhouse swing with all his force. Even at the low volume of the TV speakers, the puck shot sounds like a thunderclap, and she can barely follow its course as it rockets into the goal and makes the net twitch violently with the impact. T.K. sits up straight and follows the next replay closely with excited amusement. It looks exactly the way it did when she launched a ball bearing or a cue ball in that old factory down by the river near Mapletree: the puck, sitting at rest, then shooting off so fast that it’s just a blur in the air.', '“What do they call that swing?” she asks her father.', '“Huh? What do you mean, sweetie?”', '“When they swing the stick like that, with force. You know, ', '.” She mimics the motion with her good arm.', '“Oh, that. It’s called a slap shot.”', '“Slap shot,” she repeats with a little smile.', '“Yeah. It’s the hardest shot to pull off in hockey. Powerful, but not very accurate. Unless you have a lot of control.” Her dad seems pleased that she’s drawing on his knowledge of his favorite sport.', 'She returns her attention to the brochure in front of her, but her attention isn’t with the nationally renowned equestrian program at St. Whatsit Academy, which she wouldn’t be able to participate in anyway because she can’t hold the reins of a horse with both hands. Instead, her mind is on the events of the day—the hurt and shame she felt this morning when she got kicked out of school, and then the weird excitement when she met Simone and got treated like an equal by a genuine grown-up, internationally famous ace. And right then and there she knows that her future probably won’t be determined by whatever new rich-kid high school her mom and dad pick for her tonight.', '\\xa0', 'Later, when she’s in bed and scrolling through the messages on her phone half-asleep, she shoots off a text to Ellie.', 'The reply comes only a minute later.', 'Slapshot it is, then, T.K. sends back. Then she puts the phone on her nightstand and pulls up her covers.', ', she thinks before the day catches up with her and she falls asleep.', '“How to Move Spheres and Influence People” copyright\\xa0© 2019 by Marko Kloos', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2019 by John Picacio']}\n"

Although she hasn’t been given access to so much as a herb garden since she came to stay in my husband’s castle, I don’t trust the magic to lie completely fallow in her breast, and would not dare step foot in her rooms when the moon rides full and high in the sky. But now it’s noon and I balance the round silver tray on one hand as I rap three times on her door with the other. This is a courtesy only; the door is kept locked and the key, when not borrowed by our housekeeper at mealtimes, dangles from a blood-red ribbon on my belt.', 'A voice bids me enter and I do so, closing the door gently behind me. For a moment, I hesitate, struck to find the woman standing by the window, staring out at the snow-covered trees.', '“Stepmother?”', 'She turns to face me, hobbling on her birchwood canes. My stepmother is a vain woman still; normally she likes to be seated when I arrive, skirts neatly arranged to hide her feet. “Sit down, Fairest.” She gestures towards the small, round table where we customarily take our wine.', 'Setting down the tray, I inquire as to her well-being and she replies, as she usually does, that she is no better, no worse, before plonking herself down with all the grace of a mill-woman. “They’re no better either,” she says, catching me looking at her feet.', 'I avert my eyes and pour the wine into our goblets. Thick and sweet, my husband has it brought in barrels from the south, and I’ve developed quite a fondness for it of late. Lastly, I take up the apple along with the sharp little paring knife and begin to slice it down the middle. The flesh is whiter, crisper, than it has any natural right to be this deep into winter. But the tree behind the stables has borne such fruit, month after month, since my wedding night. One single apple each time, ripening to a bright and glossy red, and no one can pluck it but myself. Which I do, each new moon—pluck it and place it upon my silver tray, and bring it to my stepmother to share.', 'She takes a slice now, holds it to her nose a moment as she always does, then pops it whole into her mouth. I can hear the crunch as she bites down and my own mouth waters. She always takes the first taste of the fruit. We eat in silence, my stepmother and I, until the apple is gone. She spits the seeds into her hand, arranges them in a circle on the tray, then moves her hand over them in a quick, sharp movement. Does she think I do not notice? Later, I will burn them in the fire. Whatever pitiful magic she attempts, it will be reduced to nothing but ash.', 'I do this every month.', ' do this every month.', '“What are your intentions, Fairest?” My stepmother sits back in her chair, fixing me with her gaze. Her eyes are brown and glossy as apple seeds.', '“My intentions?”', '“Regarding your daughter.” She leans forward. “And your husband.”', 'Some wine splashes onto my wrist as I return my goblet to the table, and I wipe it hastily on my skirts. “My daughter is happy and healthy,” I tell her. “And my husband is travelling on matters of business. You have no need to ask after either of them.”', '“But that is ', ' I ask, Fairest. The time to close the barn door is now, before the horse is stolen away.”', '“Bolted. Before the horse has ', '.”', '“I know precisely what I said.”', 'I gather the goblets onto the tray, still half-full the both of them, and make to rise. The woman grabs my wrist, quicker than a hare before hounds. “Do not close your eyes to this, Fairest. You of all people know his proclivities. You know his ', '.”', 'I wrench myself free. It’s not her place to speak to me so, I stammer. If it were not for me, she would have no visitors at all. If it were not for me, she would likely be dead, long dead and rotted in the ground. If it were not for me—', '“I would still walk with ease,” she says, sticking out a foot from beneath her skirts. Although she wears her customary fur slippers, the scars are still visible around her ankles—red and ropy welts where the skin melted as candle wax does. I don’t need to see more than that. I know her feet too well. All those months tending to her horrendous wounds, cleaning away the foul-smelling pus and infection as she screamed her agony into my ears, forcing tonics down her throat to break her fevers, allowing her to clutch my hand so tightly that her nails left crescents that did not heal for days. We both bear the scars from those times; she has no cause to remind me.', '“I was a child,” I whispered.', '“And that child chose my punishment.”', '“He asked me—”', '“Make her dance in iron shoes, you said. Make her dance until she falls down dead.”', '“A child’s wish. I—I had no idea of what it meant. I was only ', '!”', '“Seven,” she echoes. “The age he made you his bride.”', '“The age ', ' mirror condemned me.”', '“The age your daughter is now.”', 'My lips ache, I’m pressing them so hard together. Standing, I pick up the tray. It’s all I can do not to throw it into her face, goblets and all.', '“He thought you were the most beautiful creature in the world when he saw you in that coffin,” my stepmother continues. “When you were seven.”', '“Be quiet.”', '“What does he think of you now, I wonder? Those broad hips of yours, that bosom which has nursed a babe? Not much ', ' left to you, is there? Not much to catch his wandering eye.”', 'I am half out of the door before she calls out again. “Fairest?” The edge has been shaved from her voice; she sounds almost plaintive now, and I pause, tilt my ear in her direction.', '“How?” she asks. “How will it be?”', 'Without turning around, I tell my stepmother how I will kill her the next time we meet. My tone is clipped; there’s no joy in it for me now, despite the many nights I spent concocting my method, choosing just the right words—and the many more nights I lay awake in anticipation of delivering them. It was particularly vicious this month. My stepmother waits until I am done before telling me of my own murder. I can hear the smile in her voice, the satisfaction, and in any other month I would have been pleased by her inventiveness.', 'But not now, not after what she has already said to me.', '“Next moon, then,” I say and step through the door. As I lock it behind me, her voice seeps through the wood.', '“Sooner than that, Fairest. For your daughter’s sake.”', 'I make no reply. I have no reply to make. But I will send word to the kitchen about her supper. My stepmother shall have boiled liver tonight, taken from an old sow. I count my footsteps as I return to my parlour, hoping to distract myself from their cold and empty echoes. The sound reminds me too well of a clock, counting down its minutes until midnight. There are two hundred and forty-eight steps in all, though admittedly, I made my final three small and tidy to avoid crossing the threshold on two hundred and forty-six.', 'I dislike figures with sixes in them; they do little to comfort me.', '♥', '♥', 'My daughter’s hair is like fine-spun gold. She has her father’s hair, and his envy-green eyes. But she has my lips, plump and red as blood, and my fine, snow-white skin.', 'I watch through the window for a minute or two, not wishing to disturb whatever game she’s playing in the little courtyard outside the stables. The building is empty now that my husband is away with his horses and the others—including my daughter’s beloved pony—have all been sold to repay some debt or another. He has assured me that he’ll replace them when this current venture reaches fruition, but such words would be no comfort to my daughter. It won’t be her pony that comes trotting back to the stables, if indeed any pony comes at all. These days, my husband’s promises run thin as melt-water. She cried herself to sleep the night I had to tell her little Klaus was gone, and for days afterwards, when she remembered his absence, her lips would tremble.', 'Yet here she is, building a snowman outside his very stable, her small face tight with concentration, her nose nipped red by the cold. Children can be so resilient. How astonishing that they are able to bear the very worst of losses and still step forth into each new day as though some fresh delight awaits them there. If I could spare my daughter anything worse than the loss of a favourite animal, I should count myself among the best of mothers.', ', my husband told me the evening before he left.', 'When I protested that she was still a child, he merely glared at me and shook his head. His eyes these days are red-veined and yellowing from the amount of wine he consumes. I couldn’t bring myself to meet them, and instead bowed my head over my supper. I loved him more than I feared him once, thought him brave and wondrous and strong. How naive I was: a child with no knowledge of the world.', ', he reminded me. ', 'It’s a complaint I’ve heard so often, I could recite it word for bitter word. His two older brothers were given the best lands in the kingdom to govern, my husband insists, while he is forced to preside over lazy peasants and all manner of useless men. Though I’ve heard it said that these lands where we make our home were prosperous before he took governance of them, that it has been his taxes and sporadic, unannounced levies that have brought poverty among its people and made them fear what each new season might bring. What value is there in the daughter of such a man? Short of a plague running through the rest of the royal line, she will never wear the crown of a queen—I should not even think such things, though I am certain my husband would rejoice in such a tragedy.', ', I told him. ', '.', 'He laughed. ', ' He smiled, more to himself than to me, before stuffing a whole rasher of bacon into his mouth. I could see the soft meat being rent between his teeth as he spoke. ', 'How I wish it were so. I would rather see my daughter sleeping safe in a glass coffin for a thousand years than have her hurt by the waking world and those who walk within it.', 'Five times I tap on the window, although my daughter looks up at the first knock, grinning to see me standing there. “Mama!” she cries, and pushes herself to her feet. As she runs over to the courtyard door, I can better see the creature she has been building. Not a snowman, but some lumpish thing, hunched over and seeming ready to collapse at a breath. It makes my skin prickle with gooseflesh to look upon it.', '“What have you been making, my pet?” I ask as she comes charging through the door to hug me. I crouch and fold her gloved hands within my own. Her cheeks are pink. Her teeth chatter.', '“Mama, it is Klaus!”', '“Klaus?” I stare again at the poor, misshapen thing outside. It could be thought a pony, I suppose, if one squinted hard enough, or viewed it with a mother’s eye.', '“The fairy told me to make him out of snow and he would come alive and I could ride him again.”', '“What fairy, my pet?”', '“The fairy who came last night.”', 'Sighing, I smooth her hair back from her eyes. “That was only a dream.”', '“No, Mama, look!” She points beyond the window and I follow the angle of her finger to spy a large black bird perched in one of the leafless trees overlooking the courtyard. Its silhouette, dark against the wintry grey sky, is distinctive. “See, the fairy!”', '“That’s only a raven, my pet, a feckless bird come to see if we have kitchen scraps to scavenge.” I’ve never liked those birds, with their ink-black plumage and cryptic, guttural croaks. There’s often one flitting about the castle grounds, and I never count it as a good day when I happen to spy it. Softly, I kiss my daughter’s brow. “Now, remember what I told you? Little Klaus has grown up and gone away to be with all the big horses.”', 'She swallows and her eyes glisten. “When I grow up, will I go away too? Will I get to see him again, when I grow up?”', '“I don’t know, my pet. Klaus has very many important things to do now. As will you, when you grow up.” She doesn’t say anything to that, merely hugs me tight and presses her face into my shoulder. I know that she is crying and doesn’t want me to see. I rub her back until her small frame ceases to shake. Outside, the tree where the raven perched is empty. Foolish as such feelings might be, I’m relieved to see it gone.', 'Unbidden, my husband’s face swims into my mind. His golden hair, once so glorious, now lank and greasy against his neck. The burst veins in his cheeks spreading like the webs of tiny spiders. Is it memory or imagination, the way his tongue darted across his lips as he spoke of auctioning my daughter to the highest bidder? As he spoke of how young she was, and how fair?', ', my stepmother said, and she is right.', 'His heart, and every other dark part of him.', 'I will keep my daughter safe. I must, I must. But I need to know what threatens her, and there is one thing in this castle that will tell me the truth of it.', '♥', '♥', 'I’ve never once spoken to the mirror. My stepmother brought it with her when she came to my wedding, so little could she bear being apart from the monstrosity even for the span of a week, and it’s been kept in a small, windowless chamber ever since. I know the sly deeds of which it’s capable, how it sniffs out a crack in a person’s heart and prises it open. Until now, I’ve never wanted to seek its counsel—or, at least, not enough to risk its manipulations. But I need to know about my husband. I need to be certain.', ', my stepmother told me once, when I pressed her on the subject. ', 'There’s a woman standing outside the mirror’s chamber as I approach. Tall and thin and wrapped in dove grey, I recognise the arrogant set of her shoulders even before she turns to greet me.', '“Lady Heron!”', 'The woman sniffs, her lips a taut line. “I have been waiting for one half hour. More!”', '“I—I’m sorry. I had—I was unavoidably detained.” In truth, I’d forgotten utterly about her appointment, a fact she has no doubt surmised.', 'She smiles with all the grace of a blade and nods towards the narrow wooden door behind which the mirror awaits. “Shall we?”', 'I would like to ask her to leave, to return at a later hour or even another day, but there is the matter of the small linen bag that she clutches. I need the coins it contains; they will pay for good meat for our table and perhaps a warm winter cloak for my daughter. After all, the women come more seldom these days; the mirror seems to have exhausted them.', '“Of course, Lady Heron.” I hold out my hand and she deposits the bag in my palm. It feels lighter than I’d hoped, but perhaps the coins inside are silver. After unlocking the door, I step aside and gesture for the woman to enter. She hesitates a moment, visibly steeling herself, before sniffing once more and marching past me.', 'Quietly, I close the door and move to the other side of the hall to wait.', 'She won’t be very long. They never are.', 'Scarce six minutes pass by my reckoning before she emerges once more, shaken and trembling, a handkerchief pressed to her mouth.', '“Lady Heron?”', 'The woman waves me away. “I shall see myself from the castle.” Her eyes are red-rimmed and she refuses to meet my gaze. As she walks, her skirts rustle on the tiles in whispered accusation. But how is it my fault? I don’t make them come here, these women with their coins and haggard hearts. I don’t even know how they learn of the mirror’s existence—a network of gossip and half-truth, I suspect. Whatever they expect, whatever they are told, most do not visit more than once.', 'This has been Lady Heron’s fourth visit. Is her heart that ravenous?', 'I hesitate with my hand on the doorknob. One turn and I can be in the room with it. Three steps to place me before its glassy face. A handful of words in return for… what? I scarce know what I need to ask, let alone how to phrase it.', '(Don’t I know? Oh, don’t I?)', 'Another day, then. When I have had more time to ponder my question.', 'Carefully, I insert the key into the lock and turn it. The weighty clatter of the tumblers brings me more comfort, I am sure, than the words of the mirror ever would. But do I imagine it? That barely heard sigh from the chamber beyond, so heavy with disappointment and with desire? Before leaving, I tap my toe three times and brush the tip of my nose.', 'Am I mad to have even considered such a diabolic audience? My stepmother has twisted my thoughts, most like for her sport. My husband is not a good man but he is not—', '(a monster)', 'He is her father. He would not—', '(you know his heart)', 'I need to occupy myself with practical matters and stop this foolishness. The snow has stopped and I have coins that need to be spent before my husband’s return, lest he find a more worthwhile cause for their use. I will take my daughter down to the village and buy her that winter cloak. Already, I can picture her wearing it, a scarlet weave folding soft and billowy around her slight frame, all that golden hair kept safe beneath the hood.', 'Oh, I know that I won’t be able to find such a thing as that. It will be lucky enough if the village seamstress has one of sparrow-egg blue or the bright green of ferns, anything other than muddy hues of brown or grey. If it be trimmed with rabbit fur, then we shall be luckier still. For red, I would have to place an order, and all of that would take too long.', 'My husband returns in a fortnight. The coins will need to be spent by then.', '♥', '♥', 'The gatekeep steps into our path as we approach, my daughter’s mittened hand clutched tight in my own. It takes four more steps to reach him. I do not like four as a number—it is slippery and too easily split in twain—but I dare not take a fifth.', '“Weather’s closing in, Your Highness,” the gatekeep says, his shoulders squared.', 'My daughter squeezes my hand. ', ', she starts to say, but I shush her quickly. The sky above us is a weak blue and utterly clear of clouds.', '“We are only going down to the village,” I tell the man. “We will not tarry long.”', '“The little one will catch a chill.” He does not move, though his fingers tighten their grip about his staff. “Best get her back inside.”', '“Thank you for concern, but we—we are warmly dressed, the both of us.” As I tug my daughter forward, the gatekeep too takes a step closer. So close that his broad, leather-clad chest almost bumps my own. His breath fogs as he speaks and I can smell the warmth of it.', '“You may go to the village if you wish it,” he says. “But the little one should go back inside.”', 'For a moment, I’m too flustered for words. Then I picture my stepmother and the manner in which she used to conduct herself when I was a child. How imperiously she would speak to everyone, even my father himself. I draw myself upright. “Do you propose to tell your mistress what she might do with her day?”', 'The words taste flat as failed bread in my mouth and the gatekeep doesn’t so much as flinch. “On instructions from His Grace, your master and mine both. He did not wish the princess away from the castle in his absence. The winter is foul and the woods are wild and he would not have his only daughter come to any harm.”', 'He smiles now, a genuine smile, yet my daughter hides her face in my skirts. Part of me wishes to push past him regardless, to see if he will truly dare to lay a hand on his royal mistress. But another, more certain part burns with the humiliating knowledge that he would not hesitate to do so. My jaw begins to ache, so hard are my teeth clenched together.', '“Mama? Are we not going to the village today?”', 'I forced a smile to my lips. “No, my pet. This kind gentleman thinks that it will storm, so we had best stay warm and dry by the fire.”', 'She kicks at the dirty snow that lies piled at the side of the path. “I wanted to see Klaus.”', '“Silly poppet, Klaus is not in the village. I told you, he’s with all the big horses now.”', 'The gatekeep laughs, a far from pleasant sound. “You’d be best served looking for that old nag in the knackery.”', 'My daughter stares up at me, confused. I glare at the gatekeep but the man merely winks. “That’s—that’s a place where the big horses live,” I tell her quickly. “Come, my pet. We shall go down to the kitchen and have Cook warm you a mug of honey-milk.”', '“I’m not cold, Mama,” she replies, her words frosting in the air. “I want to see the knackery. Please can we visit the knackery?”', 'The gatekeep’s rough laughter follows us up the path as I drag my protesting daughter back to the castle, and I curse him beneath my breath. High in the sky above, a raven flies in a slow circle. I curse it as well, wishing for its feathers to turn to stone, for its abruptly heavy body to fall to the ground and shatter like so many thwarted dreams.', 'It takes one hundred and nineteen steps before we are inside once more. I don’t care for that number, either. It has sharp edges and seems keen to draw blood.', '♥', '♥', 'My husband doesn’t care for the stories of my childhood, of the times before he jolted me from my poisoned sleep and lifted me boldly from the coffin, but my daughter loves to hear them. Each night, I sit by her bedside and tell her tales of the kindly little men who took me into their mountain home when I was lost, and for whom I kept house for several months. I tell her how I would make their beds and darn their socks and prepare their dinner the way they taught me. I do not tell her about poisoned combs or apples, nor about coffins made from glass; she is too young for such horrors.', 'Neither do I mention my stepmother. My daughter will have too many questions that I’m still unready to answer.', 'Instead, I relay happier stories of happier days—for there were many happy days betwixt the huntsman and the coffin—as well as the stories that the dwarves used to tell to me. Tales of crafty foxes and wise, well-born hares; dancing princesses and frogs with jewels hidden deep in their bellies; mighty frost giants who once lumbered through the mountains, and mischievous pixies with a taste for stolen sweets.', '“Can we leave a cake out for the pixies?” my daughter asks me tonight.', '“There are no pixies in our part of the world, my pet. It would only be a family of rats who come to nibble on your cake.”', '“Talking rats?” she asks hopefully. “Magic rats?”', 'Smiling, I set aside the nightgown I’m hemming. My daughter grows so fast; this is the second time I’ve let it down and there won’t be fabric left for a third. “No,” I say. “Fierce and hungry rats who will gobble up their cake and then creep under the blankets to nibble on your toes!” I grab her foot and tickle it until she shrieks.', '“Stop it, Mama! Stop it!” She’s almost breathless as she struggles to pull away.', 'Laughing, I release her and begin to straighten the bedclothes. “Come now, fidget. It’s past time you were asleep.”', 'She wriggles beneath the quilt. “Can we visit the pixies, Mama?”', '“One day, perhaps.”', '“When? When?”', '“They live very far away from here.”', '“But we can use magic and fly to see them, quick as blinking.”', '“Hush now.” I pull the covers up to her chin.', '“But Mama, we can—”', '“Hush!” Though her talk is fanciful, I don’t like to hear my daughter speak of magic. “It’s no small thing, my pet, to use magic. There is always a cost.” I kiss her three times, once on the forehead and again on each cheek, before gathering my sewing together. The candle flickers as I pick it up, casting moving shadows on the walls. My daughter cringes to see them.', '“Surely you’re not still afraid of the dark?” When much younger, she cried whenever her candle was taken away, but many years have passed since then.', '“No, Mama,” she whispers, her gaze flitting to the corner of the room. “But sometimes he is there when I wake up.”', '“Who? Who is there?”', '“The Night Man. He watches me in the shadows. I don’t like him, Mama. I don’t like his watching.”', '“Is he here now?”', '“No, Mama. You have the candle. He does not like the light.”', '“It is a dream, my pet. A nightmare and nothing to fear.”', 'She frowns, doubtful, and I lean over to kiss her again. Forehead, cheek, cheek. “I shall leave the candle then, shall I? Just for tonight?”', 'I find my way back to my own bedroom by moonlight and memory, keeping one hand on the wall as I creep along the corridors. It’s a luxury to leave a whole candle to burn while my daughter sleeps, but the way she spoke of the Night Man chilled me.', 'Has he visited her, this Night Man, while her father has been away? I hadn’t thought to ask it and, surely, it is a foolish question. It’s only a nightmare. It must be a nightmare.', 'I do. I do know his heart.', '♥', '♥', 'I knock my customary three times but do not wait for an answer before unlocking the door to my stepmother’s room and swinging it open. The woman is sitting on the edge of her bed, jerking a robe over her bony shoulders. She wears nothing underneath; I glimpse the sag of a breast, the wrinkle and fold of belly skin pale as fresh cream. Her long, grey hair is dishevelled, hanging in tangles about her face, and her feet are bare. Quickly, I turn away, an apology stammering to my lips.', 'I’ve never sought such intimacy; my skin burns with it.', '“What did you expect?” my stepmother asks. “I’ve scarce had warning of your visit.”', '“But it’s past noon!”', '“Do you suppose me unduly burdened with morning chores, Fairest? Or blessed with a surfeit of company for whom I should make myself presentable?” She waves a hand at the corners of the ceiling. “The spiders here care not a whit for appearances, I can assure you.”', 'I’m ashamed to admit I’ve not spared much thought for how she spends her days. She is fed; she is clothed. I keep her moderately stocked in embroidery thread, albeit often coarse and dull of colour, and have even brought the occasional book from my husband’s ever-shrinking library, as she once expressed a yearning for words. Royal histories, mostly, but also some volumes of verse. If I’ve ever had cause to think on my stepmother all alone in this room, it has likely been to imagine her daydreaming by the window with book or embroidery hoop in her lap, still elegant despite her fading finery, with all that wild hair swept into its usual immaculate coiffure.', 'It is a shock to witness her so… diminished.', '“I—I have come to ask—that is, I wish to know—”', '“You might meet my eye when you speak to me, Fairest. It would be polite.”', 'I turn around to find my stepmother now risen from the bed, robe tied close around her body, fingers working her hair into a rough braid. I’m careful not to look at her feet, though I glimpse her two canes leaning nearby. “I wish to ask about your—your mirror.”', 'Her eyes narrow. “You told me that you have never gazed upon it.”', '“I’ve not had need… until now.”', 'The woman takes up her canes and hobbles across to the small table where the two of us normally sit. With a soft groan, she lowers herself into a chair, then gestures to the one remaining. “I have nothing useful left to tell about that ', '.”', '“I’ve come to ask your aid in… crafting a question. One that it must answer clearly, without trickery or guile. One that is… is…”', '“Unambiguous? Fairest, there is no such question. The mirror will know your purpose as soon as the words part your lips. It will twist its own words accordingly.”', '“If it may only answer ‘yea’ or ‘nay’? How can that be twisted?”', '“You cannot impose such restrictions; it will answer as it will, with as many words as it chooses, or as few.” She leans forward. “Heed me well, Fairest. When you stand before that thing, when you peer into its depths, you also allow it to peer into you. It will see the very darkest of your fears; it will sup on them and find them delicious. And it will use them against you in terrible ways.”', '“But I need to know!”', '“You already know.”', '“No, I ', ', I ', ', I ', '—that’s not the same.”', '“It is enough for you to take your daughter and leave.”', 'The laughter bursts from me like a startled bird. Leave? How simply she puts it, I scoff, as though I might just pack a trunk, snatch my daughter by the hand and waltz out into the world. As though there are carriages and fine horses to carry us wherever our whims direct. As though no burly gatekeep would stand in our path, no armed men hunt us down should we persist.', 'As though, even if we can find a way to leave, we have a place to go.', '“There are always ways, Fairest, if you have the knowing of them. And places.”', '“This is a waste of my time.”', 'As I stand up, my stepmother reaches forward and grasps my hands. She moves more quickly than I would have thought her capable and this, along with the warm, dry press of her skin against mine, shocks me into place. I can’t remember how long it’s been since we’ve touched. The woman pulls herself to her feet, pulls me closer, her face inches from my own.', '“I can help you,” she whispers, “but first I have need of some things.” Her breath is oddly sweet. It smells of spring blossoms, and of apples. My knees threaten to buckle and I find myself clinging to her as much as she does me. Her eyes locked with mine, she gives me a list, then asks me to repeat it back to her. “Again,” she says, and I do, twice more, as her thumbs move in slow circles over my wrists. At last, seemingly satisfied, she releases me.', 'My arms drop to my sides. I feel muzzy-headed, woolly, as though I’ve just woken from a troubled sleep. My mouth is dry. “You—” I cough, backing away from the table, away from the woman now supporting herself by its edge. “You spelled me!”', '“Only your memory, Fairest. My needs are precise.”', '“You—you wretched creature! I wish you ', ' died on my wedding day!”', 'Smiling, she sinks back down into her chair. “No, you don’t. There is too much kindness in your heart, even now, even for such a ', ' as myself.”', 'I am too furious to speak another word. I want to throw something, break something, break ', '—but the only thing to hand is a pewter goblet which makes a hollow, unsatisfying clatter as I hurl it against the wall. How dare she?

It so distracts me that I completely forget to count my steps.', '♥', '♥', 'The mirror chamber is cold, windowless, and dark. For several moments, all I know is my own breathing, shallow and fast, as I stand in the centre of the room with the door closed firm behind me. Then the glow begins. Faint at first, then brighter and brighter until I might be surrounded by a dozen candles, so forceful is the light that shines from the glass oval on the wall opposite me.', 'I haven’t seen the thing for years.', 'I’d forgotten how plain it is, had in my memory conjured an ornate, overwrought frame around its edge in place of the thin band of wood that actually bounds it. It’s smaller than I remember as well. I could have sworn the glass to be longer than the span of my arms, and near as wide, but in actual fact I could likely carry the thing in two hands without much effort.', 'Not that I would touch it in a million moons. My skin crawls at the very idea.', 'The voice doesn’t seem to come from the mirror. It doesn’t seem to come from anywhere in particular, yet it fills my whole head, louder than any thought of my own, almost to the point of bursting. I can’t imagine a worse sensation than this.', '“I—I want… my daughter—is she… under threat?”', '“But here, in this castle, is she in danger?”', 'My thoughts are thick and slow. I can’t summon the right questions to ask, the right words to pull the answers I need from the glass before me. There’s a sudden tightness in my chest and my breath comes too fast to catch. “My husband…”', 'Closing my eyes, I press fingertips to my temples, press so hard into those soft and pliant hollows that stars shatter behind my lids. The pain is an anchor. A compass. “And does he… does he ', ' her also?” For a heartbeat, I wish I could unsay those words, so solid do they sit in the air, so blunt and inescapable is the echo of them. But it is done. It is said.', 'It is said.', 'The voice of the mirror swells and gloats. ', 'With that it departs, leaving me as empty as a pumpkin shell scraped for seeds—or nearly so. My stepmother’s list drifts from my memory like smoke from a snuffed candle, her words wispy and thin but persistent nevertheless. I shake my head. Will my mind ever be my own again? The glow from the mirror is gone; the chamber is pitch black. “Come back,” I call out. “I have more to ask of you.” There’s no reply, no sense that the mirror is even listening. The chill in the room deepens; beneath my sleeves, gooseflesh shivers across my skin. The audience is over. I have been dismissed.', 'I turn and retrace my steps to the door. But my outstretched hands find nothing more than bare, unbroken stone. No smooth, polished wood or jutting handle of brass, nor any crack or join that might suggest an exit. Frantic, I pace the short length of the wall, palms slapping against stone, as the gorge rises in my throat and the taste of spoiled milk coats my mouth. By what devilry has the mirror trapped me here? For what purpose, and for how long? I thump at the wall with balled hands, demanding to be released, for the door to be restored. I will not rot in this wretched chamber, in darkness and silence behind this newly solid facade, while my husband and my daughter—', 'Behind me: the creak of a hinge, a shard of yellow light, and a timid voice calling, “Mama? Mama, are you there?”', 'For a strange, disorienting moment, I can’t make sense of it. Then my daughter’s head pokes around the edge of the door she has opened—the door! on the wall adjacent! so ridiculously close!—and my cheeks burn with foolishness. I stalk over and, snatching her by the arm, jerk her into the hall beyond. She cries out, the thin, high-pitched squeal of a snared rabbit that sets my teeth to grating, and I give her a rough shake as I pull the door shut behind us.', '“You don’t ever go into that room! Not ever!”', 'The girl is starting to snivel, her green eyes wet and bright with shock, and there’s a part of me whose heart breaks to see it—but that part feels so very far away, so very small and distant and powerless in the face of the fury that boils in my breast, and I shake her again. “Stop it! You’re not an infant anymore. You need to start acting like a lady.”', 'She tries to swallow her tears, she does, but her thin shoulders hitch and her mouth contorts with the effort and my fingers dig deeper into her flesh. I want to—I want to—', 'Nearby, a throat is cleared. “Your Grace?”', 'Startled, I look up to see Lady Heron standing but a few paces away, hands clasped at her waist. She stares at me in an odd manner, an expression shaded somewhere between pity and fear, before nodding towards my daughter. “Do not berate the lass too harshly, Your Grace. I asked her to bring me here, after you were not to be found.” The woman taps the linen bag that hangs from her belt. “I wished another visit.”', 'Releasing my daughter, I straighten. “Go to your room,” I tell the girl. “Stay there.” She obeys, walking as fast as she possibly can without breaking into a run, and I wait until she has turned the corner at the end of the hall before informing Lady Heron that she can expect no visit today. Not today and possibly not ever again. For which she should be grateful.', '“Have you stood before the mirror, Your Grace?”', '“You have no right to question me.”', '“Shall I instead advise? Do not accept the counsel of the glass. Do not stand before it again.”', 'The laughter that bursts from my throat is coarse and ugly. “Shall I rather take the counsel of a hypocrite? Why do you not heed your own words, Lady Heron, be they so wise?”', 'The woman bows her head. “I am weak. I wish I were not.”', 'I open my mouth to tell her to go but the words that trip forth are my stepmother’s—the wretched list with which she spelled me.', 'Lady Heron tilts her head. “Your Grace?”', 'I repeat the list and she echoes me, her grey eyes flat and glazed. There’s a curious satisfaction in speaking the words aloud, the feeling of tumblers falling into place, a sense of being ', '—and yet I cannot find any pleasure in it. The manipulations of my stepmother and her mirror have left me drained and shaken, my stomach subjected to sour swells of nausea the results of which I have no desire for Lady Heron to witness.', '“Leave,” I snap, once my tongue feels again my own. “You’re not welcome here.” Without waiting to see that she obeys, I turn and march off down the corridor. Bile prickles at the back of my throat and I swallow, hard and hot, with one hand pressed close against my lips.', 'I cannot keep more count than that, but it doesn’t matter. Three is the safest number, after all, and it’s a simple thing to match my steps to its calm, protective rhythm. The parlour is closer than my bedchamber; I’ll draw the drapes and sit awhile in my favourite chair.', 'I pass my daughter’s room without pause. Pass, almost, without notice. The door is closed.

It helps me to sleep, it helps me not to think.', 'My head is heavy with all that I do not wish to think upon.', 'But it’s not the housekeeper who marches into the room at my summons, stern of face and bearing nought but a small calico sack. Sketching a curtsy so shallow it might nearly be an insult, Lady Heron at least keeps her gaze averted until I have risen from the chair by the window where I have been sitting. My embroidery hoop, forgotten, falls with a clatter to the floor. Neither of us acknowledge it.', '“H-how dare you intrude upon me here!” My cheeks feel hot, my knees unsteady.', 'The woman curtsies once again. “Forgiveness, Your Grace—I have your price.”', 'Frowning, I stare at the lumpy, cream-coloured sack in her outstretched hand.', '“It is everything you requested,” she says. “May I visit now?”', 'Even as I back away from her, Lady Heron steps forward, pressing her ', ' into my grasp and bidding me to look. I don’t wish to touch the sack, let alone peer inside of it. I can no longer remember the specifics of my stepmother’s list and have no desire to invite it into my mind once more. Hastily, I drop the thing onto the little table where my sewing basket sits, then wipe my hands on my skirts. My mouth is dry; I wish my wine goblet were not so empty.', '“Why—why do you keep returning here?” I demand of Lady Heron.', 'She smiles, thin and sharp. “You have stood before it, Your Grace.

Last night I woke to find myself huddled against the door to the mirror’s chamber, fingernails scratching at the wood. I didn’t recognise the sounds that came from my own throat—pathetic mewlings like those a starving kitten might make before its head is pushed beneath the water—and it took all my will to force myself back down the hall.', 'I remember stopping at my daughter’s bedroom, easing open the door and slipping inside to stand in the shadows. Like the Night Man. (Like my husband?) I watched her sleep, the swelling moon lighting her face through the window, all those golden curls turned to frost. Her mouth lolled open, a gentle snore easing between her lips. Did she dream of Klaus and of fairies? Or did she dream of becoming queen?', 'I remember taking a step towards my daughter’s bed. I remember the surge of malice in my breast. And I remember running, horror rising with the bile in my throat as my daughter’s confused, sleep-bleared voice called out in my wake—', 'This morning, I found my fingernails broken and split, with a narrow splinter of wood lodged beneath my left thumb. I still haven’t spoken to my daughter—I’m frightened to look upon her face. Frightened of what I might feel when I do.', '“What does it say?” I asked Lady Heron. “What does the mirror tell you?”', '“Words that are mine alone to hear, Your Grace.” She straightens her spine. “As, having received your own private counsel, you must surely understand.”', 'I hold her gaze for one long, difficult moment before reaching for the keys on my belt. “One final visit, then, Lady Heron, after which you may never return. If you have any sense left in your head, you will thank me for it.”', '“And who shall keep the key from ', ', Your Grace?” Her smile twists nearer to a smirk. “Who shall protect ', ' when the mirror whispers in the night?”', 'Making no reply, I stride past the woman and out of the parlour.

What if the mirror decides that ', ' will be its favoured confidante? What if—', 'Enough. ', '.', 'I fling open the door, demanding that Lady Heron take her leave right this instant, but my voice falters and I stop barely two steps inside the chamber, unable to properly comprehend the scene before me. The woman is hunched like an old fishwife, mouth contorting in fierce silence as the glow from the mirror grooves deep shadows into her face. In her right hand she wields a small hammer—though ', ' is perhaps too strong a term for the shaken, struggling manner in which she lifts it, lowers it, lifts it again.', '“Lady Heron, what—”', 'The mirror’s voice slides into me, fills me, and I stagger forward with arms outstretched. “No,” I whisper. “No, please. I must stay. I have questions.”', 'Sensing its imminent withdrawal, I pounce on the first words to trip across my tongue. “Am I safe here in this castle? Am I safe from my—my husband?”', 'The voice burns with fury; the pain is so great that I sink to my knees, hands pressed uselessly to my ears. Before I can beg forgiveness, there comes a great bellowing and a crash so loud it might be cannon fire exploding in my skull, and then', 'Gradually, I become aware of two things: the cold, hard stone of the floor beneath my shoulderblades, and a strange sputtering noise from nearby. Opening my eyes, I roll over. Something cracks beneath my hip and, in the dim light filtering in from the hall, I can see shards of broken glass littering the chamber floor. On the wall, the mirror frame hangs barren. A few feet away, Lady Heron sits propped in a corner, breathing heavily. She sees me staring and grins with gleaming, dark-stained teeth before sputtering again. Mindful of the wreckage, I crawl over to the woman. Her grey dress is stained and wet, and a pool of blood has formed beneath her. She has a hand pressed to her side, pressed to the place where a sharp and glittering edge protrudes.', '“What have—what have you done?”', '“It is over,” Lady Heron croaks. “She’ll rest now.”', '“Here, let me help.” Carefully, I take hold of the shard in her side and pull it loose. More blood bubbles up through the wound and she groans, catching my free hand in hers. Squeezes hard. Coughs. I wad up some of her skirt and hold it against her side but it soaks red in a heartbeat and Lady Heron is making that sputtering sound—laughing. She is laughing! Though her life now must surely be measured in breaths.', '“Thank you,” she says, shaking her head when I try to hush her. “Tried so many times. Each time, it held me. But couldn’t hold us both. Not together. Couldn’t hold me. With you there.” She’s lifting her right hand, curled in an empty fist. Bringing it down, lifting it again. “Couldn’t hold me.”', 'Taking her hand, I press it between my own. The hammer is over on the far side of the chamber, I see now, most likely flung from her grasp once she struck the mirror. My stomach clenches; my cheeks flush with anger.', '“No more whispers,” Lady Heron says. Though her voice is weak, her speech slick with blood, her eyes are clear. “No more whispers, Your Grace.”', '“You had no right,” I snap. “It was not your place.”', 'She smiles. “You would not remember her.”', '“Remember who?”', '“My niece, my darling. Stood before the mirror.” Another cough, harsher this time, and the woman’s smile fades. “Drowned herself, my darling.” Her shoulders stiffen, then relax. “But it couldn’t hold me. Tell my sister. Couldn’t hold me.”', 'Her gaze is locked with mine when she dies.', 'Shakily, I push myself to my feet. I try to wipe my hands on my skirts but they are no cleaner, no drier. Everywhere is blood and broken glass. I wouldn’t have thought the mirror so large as to produce so many glittering shards—nor Lady Heron capable of containing all that red mess. Have I as much in my own small body? If my throat were slit, would such an ocean surge forth?', 'No, it was—it was an accident.', 'No, I—', 'But—', 'I—', '“Stop! Please, stop!” The voice falls silent but doesn’t depart; my head might burst from the pressure of it. I stamp down on the nearest shard, a strange satisfaction rippling along my spine at the sound of cracking glass. I break another piece beneath my heel, and another. But even as I do, a sick terror begins to curdle in my belly. Damn Lady Heron to all the unknown hells for her treachery! Damn Lady Heron and—and—', 'Dizzy, I lean my back against the wall. All at once, everything draws together. It has been her from the beginning, marking out the pattern, tying off the threads, and how doltish I have been not to see it. “Stepmother,” I whisper.', '♥', '♥', 'The old crone looks up, aghast, as I storm into the room. Fumbling with her canes, she starts to rise from her chair but I’m upon her too quickly, grasping her bony shoulders and shoving her back down. She gives a soft, startled gasp and, for the first time I can remember, those brown eyes kindle with fear. “Fairest, whose blood is this?”', '“None of it mine,” I snap. “As much as you wish it were.”', 'She pushes her face closer, nostrils flaring as she sniffs the air. “I would not be so sure. You are cut—”', 'I slap her hand away as it reaches for my cheek. “Never touch me again!”', '“What has happened?” She touches her chest, hand hovering over the place where her heart would dwell, had she ever possessed such a fine organ. “I felt… I felt…”', '.', '“I see you, witch. I see you now for what you are. For what you have always been.”', 'Her gaze sharpens. “You have spoken to the mirror.”', '“You failed to destroy me once before. You will fail again.”', '“Fairest, I beg you. You must not listen—”', 'No more, no more of her evil, insidious words, fighting even now to free themselves, even as my hands clutch her pale, wizened throat and squeeze. Eyes wide, she struggles against me, fingers scratching at mine in an effort to loosen my grip. But her nails are as old and brittle as her soul, snapping before they can hope to break the skin, and the pitiful manner in which she writhes only serves to stoke my wrath. I will end this. Now. I will end her—', 'My hands close around air.', 'Unbalanced, I tip forward, bracing myself against the abruptly, impossibly empty chair. A raucous, rasping chorus fills the room, goblin laughter bold and burbling, and I whirl around, shielding myself from the sudden mass of black feathers that swoops upon me. The bird caws again, flapping vengeful at my face as it pecks and claws, and I try to move away, turn away, but it is everywhere, dogged and inescapable as death. Covering my eyes—for surely it is those soft and vulnerable globes it seeks to pluck from me!—I stumble blindly for the door, only to step on my own skirts and fall. My knee cracks on the stone and the pain robs me of breath. I cry out, rolling and reaching for my aching knee, and the bird is there, all feathers and fury, its black wings beating a gale as its beak latches onto my cheek.', 'And then, emptiness.', 'Warily, I prop myself up on one elbow. The bird, a raven as large as a cat, is on the floor nearby. Catching my gaze, it hops well beyond my grasp. The movement is awkward, ungainly; there is something wrong with the creature’s talons, an unnatural curl that twists them back upon themselves, and even as I peer closer—', '—the raven vanishes. Or, doesn’t vanish precisely, but is simply ', '—with my stepmother now crouched, naked and breathing harder than I am, in its place. Reaching into her mouth, she pulls out a shard of mirrored glass the size of my thumbnail. “You will feel more yourself, Fairest,” she says, her voice hoarse and broken, “now this foul thing is removed.”', 'I touch my cheek, feel the blood running fresh from the wound. I remember Lady Heron, and the glass I pulled from her side. The dauntless scarlet flow that leeched all warmth from her flesh. ', 'My hands begin to tremble. ', '. My stomach convulses and I lurch onto my side, vomiting a thin burgundy gruel onto the stones.', '“Fetch my robe,” my stepmother says. “And my canes. Please, Fairest.”', 'Her neck is red, marred with deep crescents that will likely bruise. Shaking, I wipe my chin with the back of my hand. “I—I don’t… I’m sorry…”', '“Hush now.” She smiles. “After all these years, what use have the two of us for apologies?”', 'I fetch my stepmother’s robe. And her canes. We sit at the round wooden table, the small shard of glass between us. I fuss at my fingers, trying to scrape away the dried blood crusted around my nails. What a fright I must look. “How—how… the raven, I mean…”', '“I was a witch long before you were born, before I even laid eyes upon your father. Did you think I had forgotten all my clever tricks?” She pauses, prods the shard with her index finger. Gingerly, as if it might bite. “Though, for a while, I could do nought but mend. It swallows no small part of you, Fairest. I think you have had a taste of that.”', 'I look away. From the shard, from my stepmother. “But how long?”', '“Several years now.” Her chuckle is raspy, dry as the last leaves of autumn. “Blessed three, I should have gone mad locked in this room without my wings.”', '“But you could have fled at any time!”', '“Is that what you think? That I could leave you to the fate I myself had wrought? You, and then your daughter? The mirror held me for so long, so sweetly and so ruthlessly—but the fault was mine. I stood before it. I asked my foolish question. I opened my heart to its hooks.”', '“Has this been your penance?” The words taste as bitter as they sound.', '“No, Fairest, it has been my justice. And it is not yet done.” My stepmother stands and hobbles across to her nightstand. Moving with care, she retrieves the jug of water left for her bathing and returns to the table. Gently, she takes my hand in hers. I flinch but stop short of pulling away. My stepmother works patiently, rubbing at my fingers with an old linen napkin. “So much blood,” she murmurs. “And so little of it yours.”', 'I tell her everything, words spilling from my lips like stolen jewels.', 'My stepmother listens in silence as she cleans, pausing now and then to dip her napkin in the water. Soon the cloth is pink as my daughter’s cheeks—and oh, my daughter, my darling one! How could I have spoken to her with such fury? How could my heart have been so quickly hardened against its sole delight that almost I wished her—', '“Yet you did not,” my stepmother says, wiping at my tears. “And she is not.”', '“Oh, but what have I done? My husband returns in a matter of days.”', '“Lord Heron will miss his poor wife sooner than that.” Leaning back in her chair, she nods at the mirrored shard between us. “Take that thing and throw it from the window. Its song is faint, but still I hear it keenly.”', 'The sky outside is a cold, wintry blue and I fling the shard as hard as I can, the mirrored side glinting in the sunlight as it sails its final arc. My thumb smarts; blood beads from a fresh-made cut. “Good riddance to you,” I mutter. Despite the chill, I linger by the window a moment more, staring out at the pine forests that border this side of the castle grounds and at the mountains beyond, their crowns hidden in low cloud.', 'She could have fled at any time. Fled and flown and been free.', '“Fairest,” my stepmother calls. “There isn’t much time.”', 'Squaring my shoulders, I take a deep breath and turn to face her. “Tell me, then. What must I do?”', '♥', '♥', 'My daughter is wholly unafraid of the old woman who sits before her, smearing a clear but strange-smelling ointment onto her face. She giggles, wrinkling her nose, and reaches out to run eager fingers through my stepmother’s hair. “Are you a fairy?”', 'My stepmother smiles. “Some might say so.” There’s a kindness in her voice and in her eyes. Gently, she untangles her hair from my daughter’s grasp and sweeps it over her shoulder. “Now stop wriggling, little one.”', '“Mama says magic is dangerous.”', 'The woman flicks me a glance. “Your mother is right. You should mind her words.”', 'Beneath its ointment, my face itches and my mouth is dry with doubt. She could have fled at any time, I tell myself, fled and flown and been free. Fear is a stubborn habit; it must be broken again and again. Though my stepmother was well pleased with what Lady Heron had brought to the castle, she refused to let me watch as she mixed her ingredients.', ' I was sent instead to fetch my daughter, whom I found curled up on her bed, speaking in whispers to the yellow-haired doll my husband brought back from his travels last spring. Her eyes widened as I entered the room, and she shrank back when I sat down beside her.', 'I pulled her into my arms, held her and rocked her as I did when she was a babe. ', ' Pressing my face into her hair, I soaked in the sweet, familiar scent of her scalp until she started to twist against me, protesting the tickling of my breath. ', ' My fingers found her ribs, and the soft hollows of her knees, wiggled in beneath her arms until she was shrieking with laughter. ', ', I said at last, smoothing the tangled curls from her eyes. ', 'The doll she left discarded on the bed, its glass-eyed gaze fixed on the ceiling.', '“Fairest?” My stepmother holds my daughter by the hand. “We are ready.”', '“Where—where is your ointment?”', '“My enchantment was wrought to last. I have no need of unguents, nor any quills save what fledge from my own skin.” She nods at the two feathers lying side by side on the table, sleek and black with promise. Muttering beneath her breath, my stepmother selects the smaller of the two and twirls it between her fingers.', '“Will it hurt, Lady Fairy?” my daughter asks, voice faltering.', '“No, little one. Quite the opposite.”', 'Quick as a serpent striking, the woman stabs the feather into my daughter’s chest and I gasp, rushing forward even as the nightdress she was wearing puddles to the floor. Puddles, then begins to flop and bounce. Chuckling, my stepmother pokes at the linen with her cane until from beneath a fold there flies—a raven, smaller than my stepmother when she takes the form, but so beautiful. As the bird circles the room, swooping and soaring, my fear dissolves into pride. Such mighty wings, such grace! My daughter flies as though she has spent all of her days in the air!', '“It might be simpler if you disrobe,” my stepmother says. She’s holding the second feather in one hand, beckoning me close with the other.', '“What if we become lost? What if—”', '“Do you suppose I have frittered away all these years without making preparations? Without securing us a haven? You need to trust me, Fairest, one last time.”', 'I shed my blood-stiff garments and take a deep, steadying breath. She could have fled at any time, fled and flown and been free.', '“Three days, Fairest, before this magic weakens. We have much ground to cover.”', 'I close my eyes. Already I can smell the mountains, can taste the snow-crisp air. Then a flash quiets my mind, and I feel myself flexing and folding, stretching and sharpening and—flying, flying, oh! Flying so fast, too fast for this too-small space, with giddying swoops, and banking as a wall rises before me, and another wall, and another, and there—the window and through it to the open air. From behind me, a black arrow shoots. She wheels and caws, and there at her tail is the smaller bird, the beloved bird—oh, my beloved bird!', 'I follow them both, our wings beating us through the clear and boundless sky.', '♥', '\\xa0', 'Text copyright © 2018 by Kirstyn McDermott', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Audrey Benjaminsen']}\n"

The man with me that day was handsome. He was twenty-five years my senior, with three teeth of silver, a gold-hilted sword and dagger, and a string of badges he’d won by gambling his life for the King’s glory in a foreign land.

The answer was no: I don’t exchange labor for coin, I murder and rob. Of course I couldn’t tell him that, nor could I in good conscience distance myself from those among my friends who work more honestly.', 'I giggled instead. Men seem to like when I giggle at them. I don’t understand how they don’t see through it.', 'He jangled his full purse, laughing his horrid laugh. “Too many people think only about coin.” As if it would be strange for those of us without to be concerned about acquiring what we need to feed ourselves, clothe ourselves, house ourselves. “It’s weakness, pure and simple, and what people don’t understand is that weakness is our enemy.

Two, it drew the finest wares and wanderers in the country.', 'There was good work to be had at the night market. All kinds of work, legal and not.

I know what it’s like to need to advertise to the world what you are, so that people don’t just assume you are what they think you are.', '\\xa0', '“I have the coin to pay you,” I told Henrietta.', 'The thick canvas walls blocked the light from the street, and only the red ember glow from a dying brazier lit either of us at all. Thick incense, of a scent too exotic to place, tickled my nose.', 'Weary lines were etched into the witch’s dry skin, and she looked as old as the town, as old as the kingdom. Henrietta had as much magic as anyone on the island; she could look however she wanted. She chose to look decrepit. I liked that about her.', '“You wish to become a creature of the lakes and rivers and the sea?” she asked.', 'I nodded.', 'Henrietta frowned. “Better to just let me read your palm and go.”', 'I pulled the coins and the coiled gold wire out from my purse and placed them on the counter. They gleamed, even in the scarce light of the embers.', '“A spell like that would leave me drained a fortnight, at least. I’d lose all my other work. That’s quite a wealth of gold you have, child, and it could buy most anything in the market. It cannot buy Henrietta for a fortnight.”', 'I nodded. I’d expected that. I went back into my bag and pulled out the medals.', 'Her eyes grew wild, with surprise, greed, or suspicion.', '“Tell me more specifically,” she said. “What do you desire to become?”', '“A mermaid.”', '“I can give you the tail of a fish and gills on your throat. I can point your teeth and give you a gullet built for blood. I will not work the dark magic required to make you immortal. I can’t grant you magic of your own, and you won’t be able to shift your tail to legs to move on land. You will be a creature of the water, and of the water only.”', 'I’d figured that was likely.', '“Tell me, child,” Henrietta said, “have you been talking to the Lady of the Waking Waters?”', 'I thought no one knew of her but me. If Henrietta recognized the medals, she would know what happened to the soldier. She’d know my culpability in his death, sure, I’d counted on that–but she’d know the Lady’s involvement as well.', '“Breathe, child,” Henrietta said. “Your eyes are wide and wild with guilt and it won’t do to be seen that way. I’m in the business of revealing the truth of the future and the past, but I’m not in the business of informing on my customers.”', 'She stood up–an imposing figure, like a stooped giantess–and went to close the flap of her tent. No light, no sound, came in through that canvas. The incense seemed thicker, the air hazier.', '“Why?” she asked.', '“Does it matter?”', '“Yes.”', 'It took me a moment to collect my thoughts. “Because I’m in love,” I said.', '“Is that a reason to give up your life on land and your body?”', '“What life?” I asked. “Selling flowers for copper? Risking everything, constantly, to steal gold? This is the third town I’ve lived in in five years.”', '“How will you run from your troubles, without legs?”', '“I’ll have the whole of the ocean!”', '“All right,” Henrietta said. “Stand up then, let’s have a look at you.”', 'I stood.', '“You’re a boy under all of that?” she asked. There was no judgment in her voice. Ever since I’d taken a woman’s name and worn women’s clothes, people quickly sorted themselves into three categories: those who wanted to fuck me, those who were repulsed by me, and those who simply didn’t care. Henrietta didn’t care.', '“More or less,” I said. It was hard to think of myself as a boy at all.', '“Won’t matter soon enough,” she said. “Soon enough you’ll be a fish. Come on then, let’s get down to the water. I know a cove that should work.”', '“Right now?” I asked.', '“You sounded like you were sure before.”', '“Shouldn’t we wait until tomorrow? So I can, I don’t know, get my affairs in order?”', '“I thought there was nothing for you on land?”', ' suddenly felt like an exaggeration. There was Nettle and Fitch, the two girls I shared a room with in the loft over the stables. Would they be able to make copper enough for the landlord without me? And Fitch, the way she looked at me. I was in love with the Lady, that was as certain as the sun, but I liked the way Fitch looked at me too.', '“I’ll meet you down there,” I said. “Give me, I don’t know, an hour.”', '“I will cast the spell as the first light of dawn breaks over the water.”', 'I started to collect my gold from the table.', '“Leave that here,” Henrietta said.', '“What?”', '“Leave that here so I know you’re serious, so I know this isn’t a prank, a waste of Henrietta the Honored’s time. I will destroy some not-inexpensive things in preparation for this working, and I won’t be cheated.”', '“Where’s the cove?” I asked.', '“Where the Waking Water feeds into the ocean. Don’t be late, child. A spell works on its schedule, not yours. If I prepare the spell, it will be cast at dawn regardless of what any of us desire.”', 'I nodded, and stood. The incense had me dizzy, and I stumbled out of the tent, back into the noise of crowded humanity.', '\\xa0', 'At least a dozen men-at-arms crowded together near the front gate, strapping on coat-of-plates and brigandine. Each of the men towered over me, and the heads of halberds and pikes towered over them in turn. I shied back. Menace was in the air, and my head was still fogged with the incense and magic from Henrietta’s tent.', '“Saw him leave with a girl,” one man, a hostler in town for the market, said.', 'I flipped up my hood, hiding my feminine hair, and took a half step back into the gathered and gathering crowd.', '“You tell me when they left, how tall this girl was, and I’ll track Holann down sure as your mother’s milk.” The man who said that was a gray-haired old ranger, stocky and short with a glint of malice in his remaining eye.', 'Holann. The man I killed had been named Holann. Didn’t matter.', '“What,” another soldier asked, “so we can catch him with another whore in the woods? Just let him sleep it off, we’ll see him in the morning.”', '“You ever known him to abandon his post?” the ranger asked.', 'They argued for a while after that. The crowd lost interest and dispersed, and I found the shadow of a glassblower’s stall to hide in.', 'They were going to find the Lady.', 'They would follow my tracks down the hills and through the trees and to the water, and they would find the Lady, and all the magic she could bring to bear wouldn’t be enough to stop a company of the King’s own men. Not if she didn’t know they were coming.', 'Henrietta could wait. My transformation could wait. I ran.', '\\xa0', 'If I’d had time, I could have misled the tracker. I’m not sure how. I could have thought of something. There wasn’t time.', 'I walked out of the town gate, through the crowd of arrivals, with my hood still obscuring my face. I made it to the tree line, stepped through, and went back to running.', 'There was no direct path, just a series of gullies and deer trails, and darkness obscured the forest. I didn’t get lost. I’d gone that way a hundred times. I skinned my knee, deep, on the rocks when I slipped near the end, but I scarcely registered the pain. My love was in danger.', 'I stumbled out of the trees and waded into the pool at the base of the falls. I would have shouted her name, had she a name, had I not been afraid of calling attention to our location.', 'The night had grown cold, and the water sapped at my strength if not my resolve. I plunged through the falls and into the alcove behind. Phosphorescent moss cast faint light that glistened on wet stone.', 'I saw her sleeping on the shelf, with legs. It was so easy to imagine she slept with legs because she wanted to sleep next to me. It was so easy to imagine that land was her first home, that water was simply another realm she could travel within.', 'It wasn’t fair, that she could walk and swim and I had to choose forever between one or the other. It wasn’t fair that I should be the one who would sacrifice for us to be together, when it would be so much easier for her.', 'She was beautiful. In the usual ways, yes, but she was also beautiful in the ways that anyone might become, when you get to know the secret language of their body and their lives. She’d been alive so long, seen so much, developed so much beauty. The longer I might know her, the more of her hidden beauty I might unearth.', '“My Lady,” I whispered. I couldn’t hear my own words over the roar of the water.', '“My Lady!” I shouted.', 'She woke, twitching, thrashing like a fish, and for a moment she wasn’t human. She was never human.', '“You’re back,” she said, as she came to her senses. “So soon.”', '“They’re coming,” I said.', '“Prey?”', '“Too many,” I said. “Men-at-arms. Friends of the man you…we…killed.”', 'She nodded.', 'A crueler person–maybe any human–would have blamed me.', '“Have you come to die for me? With me?” she asked. There was no fear in her voice, nor even grim determination. She asked it like she might ask my thoughts on the weather. No, she asked it like she asked before she kissed me, before she touched me. She was asking for my consent.', 'For a moment, I wanted to die alongside her as fiercely as I wanted to kiss her. My life had been brief, to be sure, but many lives are, and length alone is no grounds on which to judge.', '“I’ve come to warn you,” I said, as the urge passed, “and I’ve no intention of dying. We have to make for the ocean.”', '“I chose this pool a hundred years ago, as a yearling. It is my home,” she said.', '“You’ll find another.”', '“Is that what you do? Go from place to place, rootless?”', '“Every time they come after me,” I agreed.', '“I can’t live like you. I wouldn’t survive, any more than you’d survive drowning.”', '“I want a home,” I said. “I want ', ' to be home. I don’t care where it is, as long as you’re there.”', '“I can’t live like you.”', 'Tears fought their way down my cheeks and I was glad for the cold spray of the falls that disguised them.', '“Can you do it this once?” I asked. “Leave your home?”', '“No,” she said. “It would be nicer to stay here, don’t you think? Nicer to enjoy one another, then fight and die?” She kissed me then, and I had endless time to consider it.', 'She might have kissed me longer than I thought, because when my mouth broke from hers, I heard a distant crashing that likely couldn’t be anything but an armored man sliding down a slope.', 'I took her by the hand. I had no weapons but a knife, and no training in combat. If I stayed, it would be purely symbolic. There was no reason not to run, not to save myself. Still, I didn’t let go.', '“I see them!” someone shouted. “There, in the pool!”', '“Just a couple of girls!” another man’s voice called back. He kept speaking, too, after that, but I couldn’t make out the words.', 'I couldn’t see them. They were hidden by the trees.', 'I tried to lead the Lady away, but she resisted.', '“We can’t fight them all,” I said.', '“Yes we can,” she said. “We might not be able to stop them all, but we can certainly fight them.”', 'Then they came out of the woods as fog began to rise, and they were terrible. The white-painted armor of the King lent them a ghostly look, made worse by the rising fog and the starlight. Their pikes were death, their swords were death, and contrary to every song ever sung, death is the opposite of love.', 'I wanted love.', 'My body was numb with adrenaline and cold water, and I was up to my waist in the pool. I got my knife into my hand.', 'They approached with their pikes and shouted their words that insisted on surrender but I don’t know that I heard them or anything at all.', 'A spear reached for me, and the Lady took it by the haft and pulled its wielder off balance, and another spear sliced her shoulder while she did and her dark blood ran into the water. More spears were coming.', 'Something broke in her as her skin split apart. “You’re right,” she said. “I’ll make for the ocean.”', 'We dove under, swam until the pool grew too shallow, then ran along the creek.', 'As I vaulted a fallen log, I rested my left hand on the trunk of a nearby tree for balance. A crossbow bolt shot through my palm, pinning me.', 'The Lady broke the shaft of the quarrel and I pulled free my hand. Another bolt cut through my cape.', 'Every obstacle we crossed increased our lead, because a thief and a fey can move faster through the woods than those who are armed and armored. Soon they gave up on shooting at us entirely. Soon after, we couldn’t hear them.', '“They know we’re following the creek,” I said. “If we break from it, we can lose them in the fog.”', '“If I can’t be in my pool, I need to be in the ocean. You can hide in the fog. I can make my way alone.”', '“No,” I whispered, and kept going, my wounded hand wrapped in my cloak.', 'We reached the top of another waterfall, one that sent the creek cascading down to the beach. I looked down into the dark gray nothing of the morning. Somewhere down there was the ocean, and presumably Henrietta on the beach nearby. It wasn’t too late for the spell.', 'It would be a hell of a climb to get down there, however.', 'The Lady turned to me, looked me in the eyes. She was searching, trying to understand me.', '“There’s a witch,” I said, as I held her by the waist, “meeting me at the beach. She said she can transform me.”', '“Into a creature of the sea?” the Lady asked.', '“Yeah.”', '“Is that what you want?”', '“I want to be with you,” I said. “However I can.”', '“Then do it,” she said. Her eyes were still searching my face. “Be with me.”', 'Was there no passion in her voice because I didn’t know how to listen for it? Was there no passion in her voice because there was none in her heart? Or was there passion, deep passion, and my terror kept me from hearing it?', 'Without another word, the Lady knelt down and climbed over the edge of the cliff. I’d have to climb down after, with my left hand useless.', 'Nothing to do but to do it. I knelt down, looking for a ledge.', 'A crossbow bolt found my leg and I pitched forward, down into the fog, down into the gray.', '\\xa0', 'The ocean has its own kind of cold, a rough and salty cold that will kill you as sure as the snowmelt cold of mountain rivers. I hit that cold and it cracked me into consciousness, but my leg wouldn’t respond to my commands and my hand was warm with blood.', 'There was no surface in sight.', 'I’d tried. No one could say I hadn’t tried.', 'Most people would say I’d gotten what I deserved, and maybe they’d be talking about me being a thief and murderer but more than a few would say it because I was a monster and I’d always been a monster.', 'Nettle and Fitch would miss me, and Fitch might miss me for more than my share of the rent. But mourning isn’t always just a hardship, it’s part of the beauty of life. My death might lend them beauty.', 'I’d also saved my love.', 'Who, to be honest, I shouldn’t have loved.', 'Water made its way into my lungs. Cold water shouldn’t feel like fire. It did.', 'She loved me, in her way. I loved her, in mine. We could have had that love slowly. I could have not become obsessed. I could have fed her men and those men’s coins could have fed me.', 'Instead, I was drowning.', 'I closed my eyes because I couldn’t see anything anyway, and there was that fire in my chest. Better to sleep than to burn.', 'I slept.', 'I woke on shore with her mouth on mine and the fire was out of my chest, in every way, all at once. I wasn’t drowning anymore. That was her magic. I wasn’t obsessed anymore. That was mine.', 'Behind her, a stooped giantess of a witch held aloft a raw crystal the size of a boulder. The mist seemed to shrink away from it and her, leaving us in a bubble of clarity in an obscured world.', '“Good morning, child,” Henrietta said, with an uncharacteristic giggle in her voice. “I’m glad you could make it.”', '“Laria,” the Lady said. Even then, even as I stood on the precipice of death, her face was without emotion.', '“I’m fine,” I said, because I wasn’t dead and I probably wasn’t even dying, and by that standard, everything was fine. I struggled to my knees. Gentle waves lapped against me, and the sand was cool beneath me.', '“The spell is cast,” Henrietta said. “The dawn will break in a moment, and the first ray will strike this crystal and all you must do is stand in its light if you choose. The Sea Mother will take you for her own.”', '“Wait,” I said.', '“I cannot.”', '“Stand down!” a man’s voice shouted, louder than the waves, echoing against the cliffside.', 'He approached, a silhouette with a crossbow drawn. The Lady ran at him. He shot once, missed.', 'He stepped out of the mist and into the circle, dropping his crossbow and drawing a short sword. It was the tracker. He must have come ahead of the rest of the men, being the only one capable of climbing down the cliff.', '“Stand down!” he shouted again.', 'The Lady lunged for his sword hand, but he was too fast. He swung at her and missed.', 'They danced, both too experienced to easily defeat the other. Since he had friends coming, however, time was on his side.', 'He cut the Lady, shallow across the other shoulder as she’d been cut before, and her blood ran red. I could see the color this time. It was almost dawn.', '“I killed him!” I said, standing, shouting. “I killed that man whose name I don’t care to know; I stole every copper he’s ever taken from a corpse in war.”', 'It worked. The man turned his attention to me. I limped closer, until I was just outside the range of his blade.', '“I am going to live my life on land so that I can kill a thousand like him, starting with you.”', '“You won’t kill me, baedling,” the tracker said. “You’ll hang by sundown.”', 'Dawn broke, the crystal caught the first ray, and it shot toward me. I dove at the tracker. He swung, reflexively, but missed. My body slammed into his legs. He fell over me into the light, into the spell.', 'Incoherent red rage consumed his body and he blistered and he screamed. His legs fused and grew scales, his neck split open into bloody gills, and he screamed. His teeth fell into the sand and fangs grew in their stead, and he screamed.', 'The lady took the sword from his hand, held it to his throat.', '“Should we gut him?” she asked.', '“Help him into the water,” I answered. “Let the Sea Mother take him.”', 'The Lady and I rolled him across the wet sand and into the waves. He stopped screaming. Soon he was gone, cursed to the depths.', '“What now?” the Lady asked.', 'I had to leave town. The rest of the men would be after me. Maybe Nettle and Fitch would come with me, maybe not. I’d make it work. I had before, I would again.', '“We’ll go our ways,” I said. Dawn brought clarity the way it’s supposed to. “I’ll grow old, and I’ll bring you men once every few years.”', '“That will be enough for you?”', '“It will.”', 'Copyright © 2018 by Margaret Killjoy', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Alyssa Winans']}\n"

Mom got to her feet and waved. She was fatter now.', '“I love you, honey!” she called in this weird, peppy voice. I was thinking, like, please don’t do that—because it was giving me the sick willies. “Have a good Monday!” Then she jogged away, and the people on the sidewalk parted for her like water.', 'She’s been doing that a lot lately.

I really didn’t like the idea of her doing anything more for the Committee just yet—especially not if it might remind her of Kazakhstan.', 'Mom shrugged. “The idea is that if I make an appearance, certain people will re-think their positions. I might only need to be there a few hours, so I could be home this evening. If I’m not, Mrs. Lehman from down the hall will come over about ten o’clock, and she’ll stay the night. Either way—the leftover beef Stroganoff is in the fridge. And the broccoli, too.” She paused. “No. I should make you something for dinner besides leftovers.”', '“Leftovers are fine!” I said in a loud voice. “And I don’t need Mrs. Lehman to stay with me.”', 'For once, Mom seemed to hear me. “You might ', ' like you’re all grown-up, but we both know better.

She’s always into taking the damage.', 'Anyway, the Committee sent him and Mom to the People’s Paradise of Africa—it seems like a lifetime ago, now—and that was where they found me and Yerodin. In the PPA, the both of us, along with a lot of other kids, had been injected with the wild card virus. Some of those kids became aces, like Ghost, and some, like me, turned into jokers. But the people—bad people, not that I want to be all judgy, but I really do—who were injecting us didn’t want jokers. Just aces. So they either killed us jokers or left us to die. Then Mom saved me from the pit where they’d dumped me. I guess the bad people thought I’d drawn a Black Queen, because I was in my cocoon when they tossed me in. But really, I was just becoming my little insect-girl self.', 'Just like, a month ago, I would become my new insect-teenager self.

Maybe Ghost was feeling less weird now, and might even be glad to see me. I had to try, anyway.', 'To my surprise, when I got to the Carter School, Wally was there. He was lumbering out of the gate behind a gaggle of kids, but Ghost wasn’t one of them. And he looked as if someone had just punched him in the gut. Assuming anyone could do that to a gut made of iron.', '“Hey Wally,” I said as the kids streamed past me. “Is Yerodin still inside?”', '“Oh gosh, she sure isn’t,” he replied. His voice was thick with his Minnesota accent. Minnah-SO-dah. His shoulders were all hunched up, and he was hugging his arms to his chest as if it were winter instead of fall. And his clothes were rumpled. “We had a fight this morning about—aw, it doesn’t matter. But she was mad as heck. So I thought I’d come pick her up and take her for an ice cream. But I can’t find her. Mrs. Teasdale says she was here before her music class, but the music teacher says she didn’t show up for it. And I know she didn’t come home then, because I was there. She isn’t home now, either, because our neighbor Bob has a key, and I just now called him to check.” He looked up and down the street. “It was dumb to let her leave the apartment while she was mad. But I thought if she walked to school, same as every day, it might blow off some steam.” He shook his huge head. “Now she won’t answer her cell phone. So I don’t know where she is. Or even if she’s okay.”', 'I was stunned. Wally and Ghost ', ' argue. Wally is too nice, and Ghost, well, she just worships him.

I couldn’t even imagine what they would fight about.', '“I’m sure she’s all right,” I said, trying to keep my voice from quavering. And I wanted to believe it. After all, Ghost can go all non-corporeal and escape pretty much anything. Also, she had been trained in the PPA as an assassin, and that made her scary as hell sometimes. What could happen to someone like her?', 'But Wally was beyond worried. And I didn’t need him having a freak-out storm, too. Like, there’s only room for one of those at a time. Besides, a guy like Wally shouldn’t be scared. I mean, he’s—you know, ', ', for crying out loud.', '“Neighbor Bob says he’ll stick around and call me if she shows up,” Wally said. “But, gosh, if she isn’t there already—”', '“I bet she’s just taking the long way home,” I said. I patted Wally’s back. It made a dull thunk and kinda hurt my hand. I never would have done that before my transformation, but it seemed like a semi-grownup thing to do. I felt stupid doing it, though.', 'Wally gave a shuddering sigh. “I could go home and wait, but I feel like I should be looking for her. Or calling the police. But Mrs. Teasdale says the police won’t do anything about an angry child who’s only been missing an hour.” He grabbed the wrought-iron fence that surrounded the school, and it started turning to rust. He can do that, make iron rust. He jerked his hand back, but a three-foot section had already poofed away.', '“It’s going to be okay,” I said. I patted his back again, and it felt a little less stupid this time. “Look, Yerodin and I have a place we like to go when we ditch class. We can check there.”', 'Wally’s mouth hinges pulled down. “You ditch class?” He sounded astonished.', 'All of a sudden my tongue felt thick. “Um, just a little, sometimes, during last period.” Except that sometimes we snuck out during fourth period, too, because Mrs. Teasdale never did roll call after lunch. Mrs. Teasdale was a joker, sporting wiggly face and neck tentacles, and I think she was supposed to be a role model for us joker kids. But she mostly napped in the afternoon while we were supposed to be doing the day’s reading on our tablets.', 'And that ', ' didn’t happen. Most of the time, Yerodin and I played the ', ' battle version in friend mode. She beat me almost every game.', 'But some days, we’d sneak out of class while Mrs. Teasdale snoozed. We’d head down the street to Jinka’s Juice and grab smoothies, then walk a few blocks over to our favorite game shop.', '“It’s called the Tumbling Dice,” I said. “Ghost and I get all our ', ' stuff there. Come on, I’ll take you.”', 'Wally’s forehead crimped. The creases in his forehead had a dull sheen. If he doesn’t Brillo himself now and then, he gets all cruddy and rusty. Yesterday afternoon, though, he was spotless. At least, he was at first.', '“Aren’t you supposed to go straight home after school?” he asked. “Your mother will wonder where you are.”', '“I’ll text Mom,” I said. “She’s working late today anyhow.” Wally didn’t seem to know that Mom was in Panama. But I didn’t see any reason to mention it. And I also didn’t see any reason to mention what I would text to her.', 'Wally was still frowning. “I don’t know,” he said. “Maybe you can just tell me how to get to this Dice place.”', '“No!” I hadn’t meant to shout, but that’s how it came out. “Until four weeks ago, Yerodin and I were the same age, and we did everything together. And now—” I gestured at my teenage body. “I have to go to high school, and everyone acts weird around me. Even Ghost. But she is ', ' going to be my best friend.” I stared up at Wally’s face and tried to beat his iron scowl with one of my own. “So I’m not going home ’til I know she’s okay. Period.”', 'Wally’s frown smoothed a little. “I see. Uff-da.” Then he looked up and down the street again, as if Ghost might magically appear… which, given her ace power, she very well could. “Let’s go, then.”', '“Follow me.” I turned to head down the sidewalk.', 'Then my wings began to unfurl. I tried to get them to collapse again, but it wasn’t easy. I wished they would just snuggle against my back the way they did when I was little. Now it was like they had a will of their own. For example, six days after my transformation, I got all excited playing ', ' solo, and I jumped up from the couch. At which point my head bumped the ceiling, because my wings had spread open and flapped without my even thinking about it.', 'So I started sneaking up to the roof to practice flying. Which got easier once I discovered I could flap up there from my bedroom window. And luckily, Mom hasn’t noticed the dent in the living-room ceiling.', 'So, yeah. Flying. That’s something. But as Wally and I headed out from the Carter School, all I knew was that we had a mission and that my big, pretty wings were trying to get in the way.', '“Right behind you,” Wally said, and then his jaw clanged as the upper edge of my left wing whapped him.', 'I looked back and started to apologize, but he hadn’t even noticed. Tiny specks of rust were starting to appear on his forehead and at the corners of his mouth.', 'I picked up the pace and headed for the Tumbling Dice.', '\\xa0', 'Ever since Mom and Wally saved me and Ghost from the PPA, we’ve been doing our best to become normal kids.', 'Well, okay.

Living the way kids are supposed to live.', 'For me and Ghost, in our new life in Jokertown, New York City, USA, playing games has been a huge part of that. Because that’s what American kids do, right?', 'Besides, it’s hella fun. And the most hella fun game of all is ', '. Which is what we were playing the day before I changed into a teenager.', '“I call Baby Ocelot,” Yerodin said. She had a wicked grin on her face. We were sitting on the couch at my house.', '“Oh, that’s so not fair!” I said with fake annoyance. She always dibbed Baby Ocelot. Usually, I just let her have it because she really liked winning.', '“Watch out for my adorableness!” she cackled. You wouldn’t have thought that sound could come out of the mouth of such a little girl.', '“That attack is totes o.p.!” I said with indignation. “Even Tulip Ralph says so!” The Adorable Attack could stun or enchant an enemy, and no matter which ocelot I was playing, Baby and its AA were hard to beat.', '“Hey, I’ve won against ', ' when you’ve played the Baby,” Ghost said. “And Ralph just likes teasing us. But I’m immune to it. Too bad you aren’t immune to the Adorable Attack!”', 'I loved trash talking with her. “Then bring it on, doomed Baby!”', 'I chose Ninja Ocelot, went stealth, and started sneaking around behind her. Then, just when I came out of stealth to wallop her, she spun and hit me with the AA. It took but a few Perfume Bolts for her to finish me off.', '“Boom!” She raised her hand and opened it, pretending to drop a bomb.', 'I reached over and tickled her. “Next time I get Baby!” She giggled, then started tickling me, too.', 'Our tablets fell to the floor, and we kept at it until Ghost cried “Uncle.” Revenge was mine.', '\\xa0', 'If Wally hadn’t been so worried, it might have been a nice walk. In late September, almost overnight, New York goes from smelling like melting tar and rotting garbage to crisp leaves and spiced cider. If Yerodin had been with me, we’d have been talking about what costumes we’d be wearing for Halloween.', 'But of course Wally didn’t notice the nice day. We went down four blocks past Jinka’s Juice, where Ghost and I buy our smoothies, and then I turned and headed three blocks west. And the farther we went, the worse the neighborhood got, which I hadn’t realized before. But now I did, because I could tell it was making Wally tense. And the more tense he got, the more his legs clanked.', '“I can’t believe you and Yerodin have been skipping school,” he said.', 'My wings twitched. “It’s never hurt our grades,” I said. “So we’ve always figured it’s no big deal.”', 'Wally’s jaw made a grinding sound. “If it was no big deal,” he said, “you wouldn’t have kept it a secret from me and your mom.”', '“Wally—” I said.', 'But Wally wasn’t finished. “And if you hadn’t started doing it at all, don’tchaknow, maybe Yerodin would have come home today instead of thinking it was okay to run around down here all by herself.” His shoulders slumped. “Gosh, she’s still just a little kid.”', 'And that’s when I started to cry.', '\\xa0', 'I tried not to cry, but when the judge said I was emancipated, it was horrible.', 'I don’t want to be emancipated.

And it wasn’t fun most of the time. It was okay when I was a kid. But now they want me to be so skinny. I’m almost six feet tall and they’ve been trying to keep me at 115 pounds. I’m hungry all the time. I know a lot of the girls will eat Kleenex because it fills them up. But I tried it once and barfed.', 'They spent everything I made. I must be something horrible. Because why else would they treat me like that?', 'I guess I’m free now. But I feel more trapped than ever.', '\\xa0', 'I turned my face away and managed to get control of myself. And Wally didn’t speak the rest of the way to the Tumbling Dice. I was glad of that, because if he did, I might start crying again.

The countertop was jammed with displays of collectable trading cards, with the super-rares in individual sleeves with hefty price tags. But ', 'was more fun, and cheap. “Have you seen Ghost?”', 'Ralph looked up from his book—a biography of Abraham Lincoln—and stared over his reading glasses. His tulips bobbed, and his eyes widened. “Who’s this in my store?” he asked in his usual gravelly voice. But he wasn’t asking me. “If I didn’t know better, I’d say you must be Rustbelt. But what would Rustbelt be doing in my little dump?” He held out his hand. “I’m Tulip Ralph, by the way.”', '“Aw, gosh, Mr. Tulip,” Wally said, giving Ralph’s hand a quick shake. “I’m looking for my daughter, Yerodin. This is her friend, Adesina. She might’ve looked different the last time you saw her.”', 'Ralph nodded. “Yeah, she was a little more compact.” He nodded toward my phone, which was jutting up from the pocket of my jean jacket. “But I recognize those ', ' stickers on her phone. That game is like crack for her and her friend.” He raised an eyebrow. “In fact, Yerodin was in here yesterday, hitting me up for a free Baby Ocelot notebook. First time she’s been here in weeks. I was surprised you weren’t with her, ‘Morpho Girl.’”', 'I felt a lump growing in my throat. “I wish I had been,” I said. “I wish we were here together right now.”', 'Ralph frowned. “Well, she was out on the sidewalk about an hour ago, slurpin’ one of those smoothies you girls always have. Thought she was waiting for you. But after a few minutes, she sort of stretched and yawned, and then left. I assumed she got tired of waiting, and decided to take advantage of my good nature another day.”', 'I glanced around. “That doesn’t sound like her. But she can go through walls, so maybe she popped in without you noticing.”', 'Ralph put down his book and took off his reading glasses. “I know what she can do. I’ve seen her zip into the back room when neither of you thought I did. You kids seem to think that just because I read books, I don’t pay attention.” He shook his head. “Punks.”', 'Wally’s yellow eyes widened. “Hey, fella, that’s my little girl and her friend you’re talking about!”', 'Tulip Ralph held up his hands. “Whoa, Rusty. ‘Punks’ is a term of affection. Like ‘knuckleheads’ for those guys over there.” He waved his hand toward the table of four role-players—a giraffe-necked joker guy, a bug-eyed joker guy with no nose at all, a nerdy-looking little nat guy, and a lizard-skinned young woman. They all shot Ralph the finger and continued their game without looking up.', '“Hey, there’s a child here!” Wally said.', '“Dude,” said the giraffe-necked joker, “this is the rough-and-tumble world of RPGing in Jokertown. Any kid who spends time in here has seen it all.”', 'Wally turned to me, aghast.', '“He’s kidding, Wally,” I said, trying to give him my sweet-little-girl face. “Yerodin and I just watch the gamers play, and there’s no rough-and-tumble anything. And Tulip Ralph gets us cool ', ' stuff.”', '“On account of I’m a sweetheart,” Ralph said.', 'Wally looked down at the checkerboard tiles on the floor. “Little kids. Running around town during school hours.” He shook his huge head. “Once I find my Yerodin, you betcha I’m never letting her out of my sight again.” He looked up. “So where else do you girls go?” He pointed a big, orange-flecked finger at me. “And if she isn’t there, I’m callin’ the police. And if they won’t do anything, I’ll call the Amazing Bubbles. Maybe a few other friends, too.” He closed one hand into a huge fist and smacked it into his palm. It sounded like a sledgehammer hitting an anvil. “We can turn Jokertown upside down if we have to, by golly.”', 'I stared at Wally. I’d never seen him like this. And I had no idea where to look for Yerodin next. Jinka’s Juice and the Tumbling Dice weren’t just our two main hangouts.

You’re both on the ', ' teat.”', '“Judas Priest!” Wally bellowed. “Watch your language!”', 'I snapped out of my stupor. “It’s okay, Wally,” I said, patting him on the shoulder. He was a lot less scary when he was yelling at someone who wasn’t me.', 'Then I pulled out my phone and opened my ', ' app. It automatically logged me, and sure enough, Ghost was on. I could have smacked myself in the head with both wings.', 'My hands trembled. I hoped Yerodin had calmed down and was ready to come home, because I knew she could avoid me and Wally for days if she wanted to. As well as Mom and every other ace in town.

I think she’s really mad at me.”', 'Wally shook his big, blocky head. “Oh, gosh, it’s not you.” His voice rasped like bad brakes. “The reason we had our dustup was because she wanted me to take her out of Carter and put her in high school. So you two could be in the same class again. But I said there was no way the schools would go for it, and that made her awful mad. She was flickering in and out of being solid. And yelling.”', 'Now Wally was crying.', 'The lump in my throat felt permanent.

It’s pretty much empty except for some stuff in my room. They sold everything they could before they left.', 'And they took MY jewelry box! And most of that was just ', ' stuff. I think I maybe had a little gold chain in there, and that was it.', 'I’m sitting on the floor in the living room now. I can’t see the view because the balcony has a concrete wall and it’s right in front of me. I’d be out there, but the two outdoor wicker chairs are gone, too.', 'They’re my parents. How could they do this?', 'I wonder how long they’re going to survive without me paying the bills. Of course, they have whatever money of mine is left. So there’s that. For a while.', 'And I just now realized I can’t stay here. In this apartment, I mean. It costs too much. And I don’t have any new jobs booked. Turns out my agent really worked for Mommy and Daddy. And my court advocate is pretty much done with me now that the case is over.', 'So, no more high-rise city view for me. No more pretty rooms.', 'And next week is my birthday. I’ll be 15.', 'Yay me.', '\\xa0', '“Okay, then,” Wally said, wiping his eyes and his rust-streaked cheeks. Tiny orange flakes fell away. “Where do we look next?”', 'I considered. “Maybe to Jinka’s in case she went for another smoothie. If she was yawning like Ralph says, maybe she needed a sugar bump. Or we could wait to see if she comes back here. I mean, Ralph says she was outside, but she didn’t come in. And we ', ' come in.”', '“That’s sweet, kid,” Tulip Ralph said. “Of course, it’d be sweeter if you ever spent any money.”', 'The giraffe-necked joker made a trumpeting noise, and two of the other gamers chuckled.

Outside, the shadows were already starting to get long. And I had the sudden panicked thought that if we didn’t find Ghost before dark, we might never see her again. So I made what Mom calls an executive decision. “Come on. We’ll go by Jinka’s and back toward Carter, and maybe we’ll spot her. Tulip Ralph can text me if she comes back here. He has my number for ', ' updates.” I looked at Ralph. “Okay?”', 'He shrugged. “Sure. What else have I got to do?”', 'Then, as I stepped toward the door, my phone vibrated. I took it from my jacket pocket and saw that I had another text message from Yerodin. Excited, I slid my thumb across the screen.', 'The world went gray, and I couldn’t catch my breath. It was worse than anything I could have imagined.', 'It was a photo of Ghost lying on a grimy mattress on a dirty concrete floor… unconscious. I recognized her orange ', 'T-shirt, her dark purple jeans, and her pink sneakers with the electric-green laces. Her ebony skin and braids were in stark contrast to the dingy fabric of the mattress.', 'Someone wearing a Golden Boy mask stood over her, flipping the bird to the camera the way the knuckleheads had flipped the bird to Tulip Ralph.', 'A text appeared after the photo.', 'We added somethin’ Xtra to her smoothie at Jinka’s. She don’t go thru walls so good now. She’s OK. But that can change.', 'Ghost hadn’t just run off. She had been kidnapped.', 'My legs went weak, and I thought I was going to hurl.', 'But I shut down that feeling as if I were shutting down a fire hydrant. Because that’s what Mom would do. At least she would have, before Kazakhstan.', '“What’s wrong?” Wally asked.', 'I held out my phone. He took it, and it was tiny in his huge hands. I thought he’d crush it when those hands started shaking. “Oh, gosh,” he said. “Oh, gosh, no.”', 'I took the phone back. It vibrated again, and another text appeared.', 'U want her, ‘Morpho Girl?’ Come to Orchard and Stanton. Now. U alone. U get a cop, might be 1 of us anyway. But we C badges, so long Ghostie.', 'Also, we h8 Bubble baths. H8 them. Know Bubbles left for Panama this AM. Coz we know. But if she comes back and U get her—bye bye Ghost.', 'Just U. No cops. No suds. No Tin Man. Rusty shows up, we make Ghost a ghost.', 'And then a pic of me and Wally popped up. It showed us stepping into the Tumbling Dice. Whoever had taken it had been right across the street. It was hella creepy.', 'But I would have to shake that off. And I would have to get to Orchard and Stanton. Alone.', 'The “alone” part was going to be tricky. I knew if I told Wally what the deal was, he would never let me go by myself. Despite the kidnappers’ threats, he would probably call the cops. He might even try to get hold of Mom.', 'Yeah, Mom was in Panama. But she might come running back for this. In which case, either the kidnappers would kill Ghost right off the bat, or the current post-Kazakhstan version of the Amazing Bubbles might start blowing stuff up. Maybe including Ghost. After all, Mom had almost blown up ', ' a few weeks before. Which wasn’t something Wally knew, and might not believe if I told him.', 'So I was going to have to do something I never would have done when I was little. I hoped my new teenage self would know how to do it right.', 'I was going to tell a huge, bald-faced lie to my best friend’s dad.', 'I stared down at my phone. “They’re sending demands,” I said.', 'Wally held out a massive, rusty hand. “Let me see!”', 'I shook my head. “No, they say we have to split up right away, and that I have to relay instructions to you. I guess they think that’ll make them harder to track down.”', 'Wally pulled his own phone from a back pocket. “The heck with that! I’m gonna call the police!”', 'I grabbed his flaking wrist. “Wally, the kidnappers are watching us, and they claim that some of them ', ' cops.” That much, at least, was true. “And if we do anything that makes them nervous, they’ll—” I hesitated. “You know.”', 'Wally slumped and shuddered. Tulip Ralph and the gamers all stared. The mighty Rustbelt looked as if he were about to crumble.', 'I looked back down at my phone. “They want me to stay here, and they want you to go to the newsstand beside the subway stop at Union Square. When they’re sure you’re alone, they’ll have me relay a text with further orders.”', 'Wally’s head snapped up. “Union Square! That’s something like fifteen blocks away!”', 'Tulip Ralph made a throat-clearing noise. “Then you should get going, Mr. Rustbelt. And don’t count on catching a cab in this neighborhood. There’s a subway stop two blocks east, but you’ll probably go faster on foot. I’ll keep an eye on Miss Adesina.”', 'Wally looked back and forth between me, Ralph, and the door. He was breathing hard. And I hated myself. But I had to do what I had to do.', '“Go!” I said.', 'Wally gave a sudden nod and lumbered to the door. The whole shop shook. “I’ll text you when I get there, Adesina,” he said. “And we’ll do whatever we have to do for Yerodin!”', 'I held back tears. “Yes. We will.”', 'Then Wally flung open the door and barreled into the street. The door closed with a ', ' of the bell, and I watched Wally through the window until he disappeared.', '“Wow,” the giraffe-necked joker said. “That was intense.” The lizard-skinned lady whapped him with her tongue again.', 'I turned toward Tulip Ralph. “I just lied to one of the nicest people on earth.”', 'Ralph adjusted his glasses. “I know. I can tell when someone’s gaming. But sometimes, that’s the only way to get anywhere.” He jerked his head toward the curtained doorway behind him. “So if there’s anywhere ', ' need to get, I suggest going through the back room into the alley.”', 'I started around the counter. “Thanks, Ralph.”', '“Don’t mention it. And listen, kid—text me if I can help. I’m a pretty good gamer myself, you know.”', 'The kidnappers had said I had to do this by myself or Ghost would die.

Really good. There was a second when it felt like my belly pooched out a little, and then the bubble shot out of my hand. It hit him in his lower left side, and bright red blood bloomed on his dirty camo-green sweatshirt.', 'I ran home. I guess. I mean, I know I did, but I don’t remember it. Thank God Mom and Dad don’t live with me anymore. They’ve been gone two years now, and I know what they’d do if they found out my card had turned. Probably sell tickets.', 'I yanked off my sweaty blouse to see if I was bleeding. But I wasn’t. I had a dollop of blood on my chest, but when I wiped it away, there wasn’t anything there.

And I wanted to yark when I thought about something like that happening to Yerodin.', 'After four or five minutes, two men—one all wiry and twitchy, the other thickset with lumpy muscles—dropped from the bottom of a fire escape across Orchard. Almost every building along Orchard has a fire escape bolted to its facade, so the men had been invisible within the shadows of the zigzagging metal stairs.', 'As they crossed the street, I saw that both were wearing masks that looked like Mom. Seriously. They were even wearing long, braided, platinum-blond wigs. It was just… totes creepy.', 'Then I remembered that the kidnapper in the photo with an unconscious Ghost had been wearing a mask, too. Of Golden Boy.', 'And then I realized who had Yerodin: the Werewolves.', 'Mom had broken up a fight between the Werewolves and the Demon Princes several years back, and she had said how weird it was that a gang called the Werewolves always wore masks… but that the masks almost never depicted, you know, ', '.', 'My stomach turned, and my palms got sticky. The Werewolves had been around for a long time, and they were bad news. They had started out as your basic street gang, like, before Mom was born. But now they were up in all kinds of nasty business. Everything from mugging to embezzlement to gambling on cockroach races. And the stories about them involved payoffs to politicians and police. No wonder they’d said that any cops we called might be theirs.', 'The two Werewolves in the Amazing Bubbles masks stopped a foot away from me and stared. Their eyes were watery and bloodshot behind the holes in their masks. “Sorry to make you wait,” the one on the left said. “We hadda be sure you were alone.”', '“Well, I am,” I said. “So where’s… where’s my friend?” My voice trembled, and I was ashamed I couldn’t stay calmer. “Is she okay?”', 'The one on the left, the muscular one, spoke again. “Aw, she’s fine. Fuhgeddabouddit.” He had a deep voice with a thick accent. Brooklyn. So I thought of him as “Brooksie.” That made him less intimidating, somehow.', '“She’d better be.” I let my wings unfurl. They stretched across the whole breadth of the sidewalk. And they made me feel bigger. Stronger.', 'The twitchy Werewolf on the right laughed. It was a high-pitched chortle that set my teeth on edge. I decided to call him “Laughing Boy.”', '“Why is that funny, Laughing Boy?” I asked in my snottiest tone. And I knew it might be super dumb for me to talk to him that way. But these… these ', 'had Ghost. So what I really wanted to say was, “Hey, ', ', give me back my friend before I stomp you into tomorrow.”', '“It’s funny,” Laughing Boy said, “because those pretty wings are the only things that’ll keep your friend alive.” And then he chortled again.', 'I wasn’t sure just how hard I could hit him with the edges of my wings, but I sure wanted to find out. They jerked toward Laughing Boy’s head.', '“Put those things away,” Brooksie said. “But don’t worry, you’ll need ’em soon enough.”', 'I glared at them both, but I folded my wings. For once, they obeyed. “What do you want?” I asked, crossing my arms.', '“Well,” Brooksie said. “What we want are some special services from ‘Morpho Girl.’”', 'Laughing Boy snickered. “Yeah, yeah. ‘Special services.’” I could tell he was grinning behind his mask. “Like from a cute little butterfly.”', 'I didn’t like the sound of that.', '\\xa0', 'I don’t know why I’m auditioning for ', '.

I tried cocaine once, but it made me jittery as hell, so I never used it again. Same thing with pot—made me eat everything in the house—which wasn’t much—and then I fell asleep for eleven hours. And all those other drugs—I don’t know why anyone does them. But when I get hit and get fat, it feels wonderful.', 'And the bubbles, well, I’m still figuring them out. But it feels really good when I make them, too.', 'No. Better than good.', '\\xa0', '“Follow us, sweetie pie,” Laughing Boy said. Then he chortled, of course. He was totes gross and lacking with the charm. He and Brooksie turned onto Stanton, and I had to go along.', 'They walked half a block, then ducked down an alley. I looked around, but no one was paying any attention to us.', 'We went down a few more alleys, turning here and there as if Laughing Boy and Brooksie wanted to throw off anyone who was following. Finally, we ended up on Rivington between Ludlow and Essex, at the front door of the old twenty-story Hotel on Rivington.', 'Or what was left of it. It had once been banging. But now there were a lot of broken-out windows—not a good look for a place that’s mostly glass to begin with—and stupid Devil-worship junk painted on everything that remained. ', ' and whatnot.

They’re all about the visual on TV. And maybe people can feel a little sorry for the fat girl while they’re at it, because that’s what people do.

The wallpaper was peeling, and an impressive amount of graffiti covered everything. “But you try keepin’ a place like this clean for thirty years. When you got other priorities.”', '“Could you both please take off those masks?” I asked. Looking at the bad latex renderings of Mom was even worse than the smell. “They’re really distracting.”', 'Laughing Boy giggled. “Sorry, honey bucket. They’re to remind you not to try to involve Mommy Dearest.”', 'Brooksie pointed at me. “Besides, you ain’t in a position to make requests. You’re here to do what we say.

He marched me to a doorway behind the old registration desk and pulled me into a stairwell. Then he dragged me up to the second-floor landing.', 'And there, lying on her side on the stained mattress, lit by the sickly glow of fluorescent bulbs, was Ghost. She was breathing, but otherwise still. Her eyes and her mouth were half-open, and she was drooling a little. I didn’t know how they had managed to slip something into her smoothie—maybe one of them had gotten a job at Jinka’s—but I did know I had to get her away from them.', 'Or maybe, if I could just wake her up, she could vanish.

Okay, so I didn’t really want Ghost to turn into a killer again. It looked like she was too drugged to wake up anyway.', 'But I had been hoping I might be able to use ', ' newfound skills to save her. I had let myself imagine that if the Werewolves were holding Yerodin somewhere with a window, I could scoop her up, protect her with my wings, plunge through the glass—and fly away. In reality, though, we were in a windowless concrete stairwell. Besides which, there were two Werewolves right next to Ghost, and the ratty sneakers of at least one more a few steps up the next flight. Laughing Boy was right beside me, and Brooksie was right behind. There was no way for me to get to Ghost, even if there had been a window to plunge through.', 'My newfound skills were useless.', '“Now you see that we’re wolves of our word,” Brooksie said. “So here’s what you gotta do.”', '\\xa0', 'I’ve been voted off ', '.

Are you nuts?”', 'Brooksie shrugged. “Maybe. But the guy you’re gonna pick up has to be taken off and snuck into Manhattan. And we can’t use a boat, ’cause it’d be stopped by the harbor cops. So, long story short, we told him we knew about a teenage girl who can fly.” Brooksie paused. “He dug that. He likes teenage girls.”', 'Laughing Boy started laughing like a hyena. “Especially teenage joker girls! He’s gonna make us a fortune!”', 'It was as if an electric jolt stiffened every muscle in my body. Now I knew what this was about. The Werewolves were smuggling in a man who was going to turn joker girls into—it was beyond gross—sex slaves. He was going to hurt them the way Aunt Joey had been hurt.', 'And the Werewolves wanted me to fly him into the city for them. So they had drugged and kidnapped my best friend to get me to do it.', 'I hadn’t thought I could hate them any more than I already did. But I had been wrong. Now I wished Ghost ', ' wake up and slit their throats.', 'Brooksie looked at Laughing Boy. “Watch your mouth,” he said. “We’re only tellin’ Sunshine here as much as she needs to know.” He turned back to me. “The ', ' is bound for the Red Hook terminal in Brooklyn, but our guy needs to get off before it docks. Seeing as how there might be some federal types there, waitin’ for him.”', 'Laughing Boy chortled. “On account of he’s banned from the country!”', 'Brooksie lifted a hand as if to smack Laughing Boy, then gave a grunt and dropped it. “Lucky for us, we got a Werewolf in the harbor pilots association. He took control of the ', ' once it reached the Narrows a couple hours ago, and in a few minutes he’ll stop it dead in the water about a quarter mile south of Governors Island. He’ll say he had to reverse engines to avoid plowin’ into a kayak or somethin’. Then all you gotta do is pick up a guy who’ll be waitin’ near the bow. He’s a white guy, but he might have dark stuff smeared on his face. He’ll be wearing a dark hoodie, too. So let’s call him ‘Mr. Hoodie.’”', 'That set Laughing Boy off on another fit. “‘Mr. Hoodie!’ I like that!”', 'Brooksie shook his head, and his blond braid bounced. “It goes like this. You touch down on deck, and Mr. Hoodie signals you with a flashlight. When you approach, he’ll ask if you want to party. If he don’t ask that, he ain’t our guy. You have your cell phone?”', 'My already-stiff muscles tensed still more. I had silenced my phone so it wouldn’t buzz if Wally texted me from Union Square. But I needed to be able to contact him when I had a chance, and that couldn’t happen if Brooksie took my phone. “Jeez, of course. I always do.”', 'To my relief, Brooksie just nodded. “Good. Mr. Hoodie ain’t gonna have a phone that’ll work here, so we’re gonna use yours to make sure he’s the real deal. When he asks if you want to party, you take his picture and send it to Miss Ghost’s phone, which is in my pocket. Then, if we say it’s okay, hand your phone over to him. He’ll type in a code, and if it’s right, we’ll send a smiley face, which he’ll show you. And then he gets to keep your phone.”', '“Hey!” I protested.', 'Brooksie waved his hand. “Ah, fuhgeddabouddit. Your famous fat mommy’ll buy you a new one. Now, after you see the smiley face, you let Mr. Hoodie grab your hands or your hair or whatever, and you fly him here to the roof of the hotel. It’ll be dark, so we won’t be able to have eyes on you until you get close—which is sorta the idea, since we don’t want you spotted. But we’re gonna give you exactly thirty minutes from the time we send the smiley face to the time when you need to have Mr. Hoodie here. If you don’t show up, or you show up late, or you show up without our guy, you know what that means for Miss Yerodin. Yeah?”', 'I nodded. It was all I could do.', '“Terrific. So, you land him on the roof, where we’ll be waiting with your pal. You hand over Mr. Hoodie, we hand over little Ghost, and that’s it. You and Ghostie fly home. And if you never say nothin’ to nobody about this, you never hear from us again. Guaranteed.”', 'I stared at Brooksie and Laughing Boy, utterly monkeyed. I knew what a guarantee from the Werewolves was worth. And I also knew it didn’t matter, because what Brooksie had described was impossible.', '“I—I can’t do it,” I sputtered. “I’ve never carried extra weight when I’ve flown. And I’ve never flown as far as you’re asking, either.”', 'Laughing Boy chortled. “First of all, we ain’t asking. You want Little Missy there to be playin’ with cartoon ocelots tomorrow instead of lyin’ on a slab? Then this is what you gotta do. And the distance ain’t so bad. I figure three and one-quarter miles, straight line from here to the ship. Hell, you can even take off from Battery Park for the first leg. That cuts off almost two miles.”', 'Brooksie interjected. “But if you do that, you’ll have to run to the park from here, ’cause time’s gonna be tight. The ship can’t stay dead in the water too long without the harbor cops snoopin’. So when we say move, you gotta move.”', 'They didn’t seem to understand the problem. “Look, I really don’t think I’m physically able to do this! What if I crash into the water and your guy and I drown?”', 'Laughing Boy waggled a finger. “Then you’ll be dead. And Miss Ghostie will be, too.”', 'Brooksie gave a sigh that made a ', ' sound inside his mask. “Look, we’ve been watchin’ you practice. Didja think after what your mama did to us that we wouldn’t be keepin’ eyes on both of youse? Some days, you’ve done enough flights from your roof to add up to at ', ' three miles.”', 'My wings trembled. “But what you’re talking about now is in the dark, over water. And on the way back, I’m supposed to carry someone who weighs—do you even know how much he weighs?”', '“We’ve only seen pictures,” Brooksie said. “But he ain’t a tubbo. He’s maybe a buck eighty-five.”', 'I was dizzy now, and I almost sat down on the steps. They wanted me to carry a hundred and eighty-five pounds. Plus my own weight. For more than three miles.

But then I saw it. It was the most massive vessel in the harbor, and it was the only one stopped dead.', 'I began circling downward, using the air currents to reduce speed and rest my wings. I was starting to get the hang of riding the wind. And that was kewl with awesome sauce, despite the situation. But coasting only helped a little, and my shoulder muscles were already starting to get tired. Which was considerably less kewl, with zero sauce.', 'Even so, I managed a pretty good landing, missing the containers and touching down on deck close to the bow. I went down to one knee, but didn’t take a tumble.', 'But I didn’t have time to congratulate myself. A beefy guy wearing a hoodie stood about fifteen feet away, in front of a huge stack of containers. He had a heavy beard, and sure enough, there ', ' black stuff smeared on the rest of his face.

Then he gave me a gross smile and looked me up and down.', '“Sure, douche,” I replied. I pulled out my phone and took a picture of him. And at that moment, the ship gave a shudder and, very slowly, started moving.', 'I zapped the photo to Ghost’s phone. Meanwhile, “Mr. Hoodie” gave me that gross smile again. “You are, ah, very beautiful.” Bee-ah-yew-tee-full.', 'My phone buzzed: It’s him. You know what to do.', 'I held out my phone.

So it would be hella stupid of you to try to get handsy with me. I might dip too low, and that would end badly for both of us.” It occurred to me that I sounded a little like Mom just then. Totes fearless.', 'Of course, unlike Mom, I was faking it.', '“End badly for Ghost friend, too,” he said.', 'Which I knew. “So I guess we’d both better behave.”', 'He zipped his hoodie. “I will try to resist your charms,” he said. “But Werewolves did not say you would be so… perfect.”', 'I tried to think of something I could do right then to make him suffer for ever messing with any joker kids.

I had to fly the Russian from the ', 'to Battery Park, and then fly Wally to the Hotel on Rivington—where, we hoped, the Werewolves would think that Wally was Mr. Hoodie just long enough for me to drop him on them.', 'I grunted and strained toward the sky. Sweat started rolling down my back, and the cold knife-edge in my gut turned to hot nausea.', 'And we still didn’t move.', 'I looked down then and saw Mr. Hoodie grinning. He had spread his feet and crouched to brace himself, deliberately holding me back.', '“Come on,” he snarled. “What is holdup, smartass joker girl?”', 'He was showing me he still had all the power. Which made me furious. And that, in turn, made me feel… ', '.', '“', ' the holdup, you knob!” I yelled. “If you want to get off this tub, stop pulling me down! The Werewolves expect us in thirty minutes, and if we don’t make it, I promise we’re ', ' gonna pay for it!”', 'The Russian gave a slimy chuckle, and he stood up straight and brought his feet together. “Okay, okay,” he said. “We go now, eh?”', 'Then a blast of wind pushed me sideways, and I had to flap furiously to stabilize. The ship was starting to make some headway, and we needed to zoom.', ', I thought. ', 'I squeezed my eyes shut and gave one hard flap of my wings, the fiercest I could muster. My shoulders would have screamed out loud if they could.', 'And we rose. Just a few feet, at first, and my wings trembled with the effort. But I got Mr. Hoodie into the air.', 'I didn’t have time to celebrate, though. I had to get some altitude or we’d collide with the nearest stack of containers. We were in danger of being squished in a super smushed kind of way. So I forced more fierce flaps from my muscles, and I climbed higher. And higher.', 'The sky had become the color of a bruised plum, and the water in the harbor was almost black. Mr. Hoodie laughed like he was having fun, and he gripped my ankles even tighter. It really hurt. As in, I’m-going-to-kick-you-away-and-drop-you-into-the-harbor-you-hairy-snot-rag. But I couldn’t do that, no matter how much I wanted to.', 'We cleared the containers, barely. And now I had to make it to Battery Park. The cover of night was going to help me and Wally deal with the Russian and stay hidden from any snooping Werewolves, especially since Wally was going to knock out some of the park’s sidewalk lamps. But first I had to get my cargo to shore. My shoulders were burning, and my breath was like fire in my lungs.', '“Move it, joker girlie,” Mr. Hoodie said. He gave my ankles another hard squeeze, and I winced. “Is too bad Werewolves have promised to let you go. I could do much with you.”', 'A burst of rage shot through me. And it made me fly higher and faster than I ever would have thought I could.', 'My wings were shaking, but I didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was saving Ghost… and making sure this gross creeper got everything he really, really deserved.', '\\xa0', 'It felt as if we had been flying for hours, but I knew it had been less than fifteen minutes. I sure hoped so, anyway.', 'My wings were almost numb now, and my shoulders hurt so much that I didn’t remember what it had felt like when they ', ' hurt. And disgusting-douchebag Russian was like a big bag of rocks.', 'As we approached Battery Park, I started heading downward. Mr. Hoodie didn’t notice at first because he was too busy making comments like: “You are just what clients want. Young, nice tits, enough joker to tickle pervert fancy. Wings and skin like shiny leather. Sexy slits in shirt for extra little legs. Are you joker in other places, too? That helps price, you know.”', 'I wanted to kick him in the scrod. Just, ugh. He was hyper vile. And I knew exactly where I wanted to plant General Tiny Peen: straight into the iron railing on the bay side of the park.', 'A light mist had begun to fall, but it felt good on my burning shoulder muscles. And the floodlights illuminating the circular wall of Castle Clinton gave off a fuzzy glow that helped guide me. I was aiming for the sidewalk and trees just to the southeast.', 'I let the Russian’s weight pull me down, and we began moving to shore fast. ', ' fast. Mr. Hoodie finally twigged to the fact that things weren’t going as he’d thought they would. “What is happening?” he demanded. “This does not look like hotel! I think I call Werewolves!” But as long as he had to hold my ankles, I didn’t think he’d be using my phone to call the Werewolves or anyone else.', 'Then his ankles slammed into the railing. He didn’t let go of me right away, so the collision twisted me around and sent me skidding across the sidewalk on my wings.', 'But like I’ve said, my wings are tough. Captain Craptastic, on the other hand, smacked the wet sidewalk hard, and his hoodie wasn’t much protection. That was when he finally let go. “Filthy joker bitch!” the Russian howled. Then he tried to stand up, but fell again and shrieked. His ankles might have been broken. I sure hoped so, anyway.', 'I picked myself up and kicked Butt Monkey in the knee as hard as I could. That made him shriek, which was nice. There was just enough light for me to see the shocked look on his ugly face. And that his mouth was bleeding.', 'Then Wally came running from a clump of trees, grabbed Fuck Face (Aunt Joey has ', ' rubbed off on me) by the hoodie, and started dragging him off the sidewalk. Wally was now wearing a dark hoodie himself, ready for the next part of our plan.', 'But before Wally could reach the trees again, a gravelly voice called from farther down the sidewalk.', '“Mr. Rustbelt,” it said. “You can drop that piece of garbage. We’ll take care of the side quest, and you and Miss Adesina can finish the main mission.”', 'I turned toward the voice and saw five darkened figures, backlit by a single unbroken lamp, approaching through the mist. They were the only other people in this darkened part of the park.', '“I’m glad you made it,” I said. “But I didn’t know you were bringing company.”', 'Wally picked up the Russian by the hood and held him off the ground, dangling and flailing. He stepped closer to me and peered toward the approaching figures. “Do I need to do something about them, Adesina?”', 'I shook my head and plucked my cell phone from Mr. Hoodie’s back pocket. “No, Wally. You aren’t the only person I texted before I flew to the ship.”', 'The lead figure of the five stopped a few yards away, shook drops of water from the flowers on his head, and then took off his glasses and wiped them with the tail of his checkered shirt.', '“Tulip Ralph!” Wally exclaimed.', 'Ralph nodded. “Hope you don’t mind that I let these knuckleheads come along. But when I told ’em the game you two were running, they wanted in.”', 'The giraffe-necked guy came up on Ralph’s right, and the lizard-skinned lady came up on his left. The bug-eyed guy and the nerdy nat joined them.', '“Is that the dirtball who sells joker kids?” the giraffe-necked guy asked.', 'The dangling Russian spat a bloody gob at him. “Don’t worry, big-nose,” he said. “You and lizard bitch would not bring enough money to be worth trouble.”', 'The lizard-lady hissed. “Oh, yessss,” she said. “That’sss him.”', 'Ralph put on his glasses. “Seriously, Mr. Rustbelt,” he said. “You and Miss Adesina can go. As a Jokertown businessman, I know which cops are honest. So I’ll make a call, and the knuckleheads and I can, uh… look after this person until they get here.”', '“Gosh, thank you!” Wally said. “I was gonna tie him up, but I lost my rope when I was busting out lights.” He chucked Mr. Hoodie to the sidewalk at Ralph’s feet, and the Russian lay there like a discarded, filthy rag.', 'Ralph cleared his throat, and his four knuckleheads grabbed Mr. Hoodie and dragged him toward the trees. The Russian started to scream, but then the nerdy nat produced a roll of duct tape. So Corporal Dingus was quiet by the time they got him out of sight.', '“I owe you one, Ralph,” I said.', 'Tulip Ralph shrugged. “You and Miss Yerodin come into the Dice as soon as you can, and we’ll call it even.” He started for the trees, then looked back at us. “You punks kick some ass, okay?” He vanished into the foliage.', 'I checked the time on my phone against the time stamp on the smiley face. We had thirteen minutes.', '“We gotta go, Wally,” I said, sliding my phone into my jacket pocket. “You ready?”', 'He gave a rust-raspy nod. “I am if you are.”', 'Then I had to swallow hard. “I am. But Wally, I’m—I’m sorry I had to trick you.”', 'Wally’s eyes grew wide. “Aw, geez, there’ll be time for that stuff later. We have to get my daughter!”', 'So I fluttered into the air so he could grab my ankles the way the Russian had. I’d struggled flying with that Butt Monkey, and he weighed a lot less than Wally. Even so, I was pretty sure I could get Wally aloft—but could I get him high enough and keep him there long enough? And fly fast enough?', 'I mean, I was ', '.', 'Wally grasped my ankles. His hands were bigger than Mr. Hoodie’s, and they made a slight ', ' as his fingers clasped. I could tell he was trying to be gentle. But still, hey, metal hands. Owie.', 'I flapped my wings, and nothing happened. Again. It was the same as when I’d tried to get the Butt Monkey up into the air, only worse. This time, I knew my passenger wasn’t messing with me.', 'But one way or another, we had to go. So I gave a grunt and flapped my wings as hard as I could. I swear I felt something pop, but we went up about five feet. Then every flap took us a little higher until, at last, we rose above the trees.', 'And ever so slowly at first, but gaining altitude and velocity with each flap, I began flying us over the park, and then over the streets, toward the Hotel on Rivington.', '“You got this, Morpho Girl!” Wally cried. “You betcha!”', 'I gritted my teeth and strained.', ', I thought. ', '\\xa0', 'I guess I might become a hero after all.', 'When Drake couldn’t control his power, I absorbed the massive explosion and went into a coma. I saved New Orleans from being destroyed.', 'I’m out of the coma now, but when I was unconscious, I dreamed about a lot of weird stuff. I dreamed about a little girl.', 'Her name is Adesina.', '\\xa0', 'Time slows down when everything hurts. With each flap of my wings, my muscles screamed a little more. My legs turned numb from Wally’s weight. Breathing was torture.', 'When I went into my cocoon as a little girl, it was because I was afraid and in pain. But now, I couldn’t hide in a cocoon. I had to keep moving. And I had no way of knowing if I was moving fast enough.', 'Then, through the pounding in my head, I heard Wally shout.', '“There it is!” he cried. “Half a block! Six Werewolves on the west side of the roof. And oh, gosh, a Werewolf with Yerodin on the other side!”', 'I blinked to clear my eyes of mist and tears. We were about thirty feet higher than the roof of the Hotel on Rivington, which was illuminated by floodlights. Near the eastern edge, several yards from a clump of Werewolves, Ghost was lying unconscious on the tarred gravel. She was guarded by a Werewolf in a Golden Boy mask.', 'With what felt like the last of my energy, I put on all the speed I could muster. But I didn’t let myself descend. Not yet. I didn’t want the Werewolves to see that Wally wasn’t the Russian until it was too late.', '“Wally,” I rasped. “I’m going to drop you on the one beside Ghost! You throw him at the others and hold them off so I can pick her up. Then I’ll hover so you can grab hold again, and I’ll fly us all out of here.”', '“Oh gee, no!” he replied. “If you try that, one of them might grab you first.” Then he gave a grim chuckle. It didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard from him. “Besides, I need to stay long enough to give these boys something to remember me by. You just fly Yerodin away from here and meet me at our apartment, okey dokey?”', 'And now we were less than a quarter block away, so there was no more time to discuss it. “Here we go, then!” I yelled. “Like, gravity isn’t just a good idea—it’s the law!”', 'I went into a dive, and we came in hella fast. We were only ten feet over the cluster of six Werewolves when we shot across them and streaked toward the one in the Golden Boy mask.', '“Shit!” Golden Boy yelled. He had seen that Wally was ', ' the Russian. But it was too late. Wally let go of me, dropped like the mother of all rusty bombs, and crashed down on him. They hit the gravel two feet from where Ghost lay, and it sounded like every pot and pan in Williams Sonoma falling to the floor all at once.', 'With Wally suddenly gone, I bounced up another ten feet, and that wiped out my forward momentum. I spun in the air, managed to stabilize, and found myself hovering.', 'Wally leaped to his feet, grabbed the flattened Golden Boy Werewolf, and flung him at the six who had now started toward them. Golden Boy hit two, and they went down. The others all stopped where they were.', 'Wally’s hoodie and shirt had ripped apart, and anyone else’s skin would have been shredded. But not his. If anything, he looked shinier and stronger. Some of the day’s rust had been scraped away.', 'He charged the cluster. But then five more Werewolves surged out of the roof exit behind them. And the three who had gone down were getting up.', 'Wally stopped four yards short of the twelve Werewolves. He balled his right hand into a fist, then punched it into his open left hand. There was that sledgehammer-hitting-an-anvil sound again.', 'The reinforced Werewolves wore masks ranging from puppy dogs to demons to Golden Boy. To, of course, the Amazing Bubbles. They were armed with chains, knives, pipes, and baseball bats. And a few guns.', 'A wiry Werewolf in a Bubbles mask pointed a pistol at Wally and chortled. Laughing Boy. “You weren’t invited, lead-for-brains!” Laughing Boy crowed. “So we’ll have to show you the way out!” He pulled the trigger, and there was a loud ', '.', 'And then a ', ' and a puff of rust as the slug bounced from Wally’s forehead. “Well, gosh darn it,” Wally said. “I’m only here because you fellas went and hurt my daughter, don’tchaknow. So pardon me for bein’ rude!”', 'Then he charged again, like a locomotive with legs.', 'The Werewolves were about as distracted as they were going to get. So I dropped into a sudden dive, plunged behind Wally, and landed on the roof with a skid that almost tore off my shoes. I slid right into Yerodin, and she almost rolled into the low steel lip at the edge of the roof. But she stayed limp, and there was a horrible moment when I thought she might be dead. Then we came to a stop, and she groaned. I reached down, scooped her up, and held her tight.', 'Then, over the clanging and screams from the other side of the roof, I heard a crunch of gravel behind me. One of the Werewolves had managed to avoid Wally. “Fuhggeddabout it, you double-crossin’ bitch.” I didn’t have to turn around to know it was Brooksie. “You ain’t goin’ nowhere.”', 'But, yeah, I was pretty sure I was.', 'I leaped straight up, spreading my wings with a ', '. Compared to Wally, Ghost felt like nothing. But my arms, shoulders, and wings still trembled with fatigue. And before I could get totally clear, Brooksie was able to grab my left foot.', 'I kicked at him with my right and tried to keep heading up and out. But he was dragging me down and keeping me from crossing the edge of the roof into open air, holding me back just like Captain Craptastic the Butt Monkey had. And a Golden Boy Werewolf, broken free of Wally’s attack, was now running toward us—and if he latched onto Brooksie, they would pull me down to the roof again. For sure.', 'I grunted and flapped my wings with every ounce of strength my shrieking muscles could muster, pushing through the pain. Then my left shoe slipped off. Brooksie fell back with a shout, and both he and Golden Boy went down to the gravel while Ghost and I popped up high above them.', 'Thank God for clogs.', 'We spiraled upward, and I hugged Ghost to my chest as I felt her arms slip around me. Down below, Wally had been surrounded by the rest of the Werewolves. They began to swarm and pile on, and he vanished beneath them.', 'I paused in my ascent. I was, like, two seconds away from diving back down to try to help.', 'Then I heard a metallic roar, like a road grader revved up to drag-racing speed, and the piled-on Werewolves exploded outward. It was as if a grenade had gone off in a mound of marionettes.', 'One of the Bubbles-masked Werewolves went over the edge of the roof, screaming and crying as he fell. I recognized the voice even though it wasn’t chortling now.', '“So long, Laughing Boy,” I muttered. And maybe this makes me a bad person… but hey, I didn’t feel sorry for him at all.', 'Wally looked up at me and Yerodin as he windmilled his arm and brought his huge fist down on the head of a puppy-dog Werewolf who was trying to kneecap him with a crowbar.', '“Cripes!” Wally shouted. “You two get out of here! This is just gonna take a while, that’s all.”', 'He clunked a couple of demon-Werewolf heads together, then stacked the demons atop the puppy dog. Then a few more Werewolves attacked, and they were added to the pile.', '“Later, Wally!” I called, and made a shallow dive to gain enough airspeed to turn away.', 'Wobbling and slow, I flew away from the Hotel on Rivington toward the Lower East Side. A couple of shots rang out behind me, but I only felt one slug hit my wings. It bounced off almost as neatly as the one that had bounced off Wally’s forehead, albeit with less ', '. I had known my wings were tough—but this was the first time I’d realized they could deflect bullets.', 'Yup, the New Teenage Me was lots tougher than the Old Little-Girl Me had been. And that was pretty cool.', 'But maybe a little confusing, too.', 'I wasn’t a full-strength grownup yet. But I wasn’t a vulnerable kid anymore, either. And it had been a really rapid transition. Even after all that I had just managed to do, I still wasn’t sure what to make of it.', 'And if I wasn’t… well, I knew Mom wouldn’t be, either.', '\\xa0', 'I’m a mother now. I never thought I’d be one. But Adesina’s real parents are dead, and who else is going to take care of her?', 'Besides, we’re connected in some way. I’d still be in the coma without her help.', 'And we saved those children. That counts for something. It has to. I’m not saying it was a perfect victory, but some good came out of it. Maybe even a lot.', 'And now there’s Adesina… and me.', 'Plus, I sure did like beating the hell out of Tom Weathers’ Monster. That was the best. Filled to the top with chocolatey goodness.', 'Turns out that being a hero has an upside, after all.', 'Who knew?', '\\xa0', 'I touched down on the roof of the Gundersons’ apartment building with an “Oof,” kicking off my remaining shoe to keep my balance. And then I saw that Yerodin’s eyes were wide open and staring up at my face. So I set her down and released her. She wavered a bit, but stood on her own.', '\\n“How’re you doing?” I asked. My voice sounded hella nervous. I was still scared that she might be mad at me.', 'She gave me a big, goofy smile. “You came and got me!” Then she swayed, and I put my hand on her shoulder. Her eyes blinked slowly.', '“Of course I did,” I said. “Well, me and your dad. He kinda helped.”', 'Her eyes widened, and her forehead crinkled. “Did he tell you about our fight?”', '“Yeah,” I replied. I nudged my lone shoe with my bare toe. “And I told him about us skipping school. I mean, I kinda had to.”', 'Ghost nodded. “I get that.” Then she smiled. “I almost feel sorry for the Werewolves. Dad’s ', ' strong.”', '“Oh, hells yes!” I said. “Once he got hold of them, I wasn’t the only flying joker in the neighborhood.”', 'She laughed, but then gave me a worried look. “Are we okay, Adesina? I miss you so much, and I’ve been afraid we won’t be friends anymore now that you’re…” She waved her hands in circles in front of me. “All this.”', 'I put on a deliberate smirk. “Maybe I’ve changed a little, but I can still kick your butt at ', '.”', 'She stabbed an index finger toward the sky. “I call Baby Ocelot!”', '“No way,” I said. “No dibsing after you’ve been kidnapped. Totes unfair!”', '“Too late!” She pirouetted like a drunken ballerina. “C’mon. The Werewolves still have my phone, but my tablet is downstairs.”', 'I was suddenly happier than I’d been since before I’d changed. “All right, but I’m going to pwn you. You’re way too third dwarf right now. You know—Dopey!”', 'We went down to her and Wally’s apartment, where their neighbor Bob was still waiting to see if Yerodin would show up. So now he texted Wally, said goodnight to us, and went home. Ghost retrieved her tablet, and we sat on the couch to play.', 'She slaughtered me. And I loved it.', 'Then my phone buzzed. It was a text, but there were no words. Just an emoji of a tulip, followed by a thumbs-up.', 'I grinned. Tomorrow, my best friend and I would have to pay a visit to the Tumbling Dice.', '\\xa0', '“Daddy!” Ghost exclaimed when Wally came in. She jumped up and gave him a jumbo hug. His clothes were torn and dirty, and his face looked a little dinged-up. There was a new dimple in his forehead, and even a couple of small rips in the iron skin of his arms. But they didn’t seem to bother him.', '“Oh, gosh, I didn’t ’spect to see you awake.” He held her close. “I’ve sure been worried, don’tchaknow. And we’re gonna get you checked out by a doctor right away, you betcha.”', 'Ghost was steady on her feet now. “Okay, Daddy,” she said softly. “But in the morning, please? I promise I’m all right. I’m just so sorry I scared you. And it’s not your fault I’m not big enough for high school.”', 'They both looked at me, and I wanted to sink into the floor. “I’m sorry, too. If I hadn’t changed—”', 'Wally shook his huge head. “All that matters is you girls are both okay.” He wiped a tear from his cheek. It left a rusty trail. “You did good today, Adesina.”', 'That embarrassed me. But I had an easy out. “I should be going. It’s after nine, and Mrs. Lehman is supposed to come stay with me if Mom isn’t back by ten.”', '“Golly,” Wally said. “Speaking of your mom. Uh, maybe we don’t need to tell her about today’s business. She has enough on her mind, don’tcha think?”', 'I was super glad to hear him say that. “Yeah, I do. So telling her about any of this would be ', ' a bad idea.”', '“Okey doke, then,” Wally said. He breathed a sigh. “We’re on the same sheet of the funny pages.”', 'Ghost gave him a suspicious look. “Daddy,” she said. “You’re giving the feeling that maybe, just once in a while… you used to skip school.”', '\\xa0', 'I’m not sure who I am anymore. What I did in Kazakhstan was unspeakable. How could I have done those things? How?', 'Madness. There was nothing but madness.', 'But wasn’t it pulled from somewhere inside me?', 'Am I a monster?', 'Can anyone ever forgive me?', '\\xa0', 'When I got home from the Gundersons’, I decided I wasn’t hungry. Not even for yummy leftover beef Stroganoff.', 'Instead, since I still had a few minutes before Mrs. Lehman would come over, I pulled out Mom’s diary again. I kept coming back to the last entry. See, that Kazakhstan madness had tried to catch me, too. But I protected myself in my cocoon.', 'Mom, though, was there in the flesh. It ripped her mind apart, and that’s why she’s so… broken now.', 'As I stepped out of her bedroom, I heard the front door open. I assumed it was Mrs. Lehman, using the key Mom had given her. But when I came into the living room, there was Mom with a bag of groceries in one arm and flowers in the other.', '“Hi, Mom!” I took the groceries from her. “I guess stuff in Panama went okay? And you called Mrs. Lehman?”', 'She shrugged. “I sent Mrs. Lehman a text. As for Panama, there was nothing to it. Turned out the people the Committee thought were going to be a problem were just being paid to be obstreperous for a day. They ’fessed up when I put one of them into a bubble and offered to roll it into the canal. But none of them seemed to know where the money had come from, or why they were told to stall.”', 'I had a pretty good idea, myself. But of course I couldn’t say. “Maybe someone just wanted a celebrity encounter with the Amazing Bubbles. Oh, and what’s up with the flowers?” I hoped that would change the subject.', '“I thought they might brighten up the place.” She looked sad for a moment, and then there was that blankness again. I’d been sure she’d look at me and know I had been up to something. But no. Nothing.', '“Mom.” I put the groceries on the kitchen counter, then waved my hand in front of her face. “You okay?”', 'She blinked and was back. She gave me a wan smile. “Yes, dear. Panama was nothing. I’m fine.”', 'But she wasn’t fine, and there was nothing I could say to change it. I didn’t have the right words.', 'And then I realized that even though there was nothing I could say… there might be one thing I could ', '.', '“Hey,” I said as we put away the groceries. “I know it’s kinda late, and a school night, but… just for a little while, maybe we could get out of the house and do something totes fun.”', 'She gave me a falsely bright smile. “What’s that, honey?”', '“We could go to the Statue of Liberty.”', 'A confused expression crossed her face. “I don’t think the ferry runs this late.”', 'I took her hand and gave a tug, but I couldn’t move her. She was pretty pudgy at the moment.', '“C’mon, Mom,” I said.', 'She shook her head as if she were just waking up. “Okay, fine, if you’re going to insist.” She half laughed and almost sounded like the old Mom. Then she let me pull her into my bedroom.', 'I let go of her hand, cranked my window open, and climbed onto the sill. The mist had stopped, and the sky was almost clear.', 'I stepped out onto the narrow ledge and turned to face Mom.', 'Her eyes were wide. “You can’t,” she said. “You never told—”', 'But before she could finish her sentence, I jumped backward, letting my wings spread wide. Mom gave a little squeak, then ran over and stuck her head out.', '“Why didn’t you tell me?” she asked. There was both wonder and annoyance in her voice. Definitely more like the old Mom. “How long have you known?”', '“Not long,” I replied, hovering. I looked down and saw people on the sidewalk stopping to squint up past the streetlamps. Oh well. It was going to come out sometime. “Let’s go, Mom. It’ll be fun!”', 'Now she looked dubious. “How do you know you can even carry me?”', '“Well, we can try,” I replied. No need for explanations about that.', 'And yeah, I was exhausted from the day’s torturous adventure. But the thought of taking Mom flying made me feel like I could do anything.', '“You could bubble off some fat,” I said. “And even if you fall, well, I mean… so what?”', 'That made her snort-laugh—nothing ladylike about it at all. I loved that laugh.', 'Then she started bubbling through the open window. Some of the bubbles floated around me, and some drifted down to amaze the pedestrians. They were all like the ones she used to make for me. Soft and pretty. Shiny, too.', '“Okay,” she said, climbing out onto the ledge when she was a bit thinner. “How do you want to do this?”', '“Just wrap your arms around me.” She reached out to pull me close, and I let her embrace me.', 'Then I gave a few strong flaps, and we rose into the air. It smelled of autumn. The wind changed direction as we ascended, and I knew I’d have to compensate for it. But hey, no prob. Not for Morpho Girl.', 'I liked Mom’s arms around me. It made me feel like a little kid again. But now I was the one carrying ', ', and that felt like… something new.', 'So maybe we could never be normal again. Never like the way we used to be, I mean.', 'But maybe we could be… okay.', 'I flew upward until we were high above the city. Below us, the jumbled buildings of Lower Manhattan were bathed in electric radiance. It was freaking gorgeous.', 'Then Mom and I looped around, rose higher still, and flew through the darkness toward the bright glow of Lady Liberty.', 'Copyright © 2018 by Caroline Spector and Bradley Denton', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by John Picacio']}\n"

Don’t you be hurting her feelings.”', '“Oh, great.” She whirled and glared down at me, so close that I could feel the heat coming from the flush of her cheeks. “A bot has feelings, kid,” she said. “A starship has empathy mirror routines.

That used to be Mom’s job, but everything had changed.', 'Orisa didn’t come out of her quarters for the next two days, and I felt like I was holding my breath the entire time. Things got so bad that I found myself wishing for the good old days of watch-standing and meals, stories and sleep. I tried to get back into the Fleeners, but real life was too unnerving. So instead I rolled over ', '’', ' surface and roamed her passageways. I took inventory of the new modules we’d received from ', ' and puzzled over those we’d sent her way. Gone were the pair of sealed cargo modules filled with various hazmats we had generated, along with the auxiliary greenhouse filled with a jungle of plants, trees, and chlorophytes that ', ' had gathered on the Valcent flyby. In exchange, we’d received one module filled with replacement ice, two that were empty, and one that was almost empty except for the bumpy purple spatters on the deck that were lit with UV. Grace said that if the spatters germinated as the bioengineers on ', ' predicted, they might grow into a self-sustaining protein pond, which we could harvest for our food printers. But it would take several years before we’d know if this experiment was going to work.', 'I was going to miss the Valcent greenhouse: ', ' had jumped the oxygen content of its atmosphere to twenty-seven percent and the air was spicy-sweet soup. One of my favorite places on ', '. It brought back happy memories of the celebration we’d had after discovering the jungles on Valcent D, back when I was eleven. That had been the last time we’d found life; our two most recent systems had been big disappointments. Qory acted like all these changes to our ship were no big deal. After all, ', ' was on a survey mission and crew trades were not even the most important part of a starship rendezvous. New data had to be synced and resources exchanged if we were to grow the infosphere. Which was no doubt true and I shouldn’t have been surprised, but my only other rendezvous had been with the ', ' when I was ten, a year after Uncle Feero died. Since no crew had changed hands that time, it hadn’t made much of an impression. Although, come to think of it, Qory had started morphing from my brother to my sister just after that.', 'And now I wondered if she might not be changing again. She seemed taller. And her voice was rounder?', 'Nevertheless, Qory was being a big help about our new situation. She’d gone through several trades. It was something I’d never thought much about, but she was two hundred-plus years old and had been on four different starships and in three crèches. She said I shouldn’t make too much of Orisa’s disappearance. Forced trades happened every so often, although most crews welcomed new faces and experiences. In the long term, everyone knew that trades were important for the sanity of both a starship’s intelligence and its crew. Qory predicted that Orisa would be fine, because nobody wanted a reputation for being a misfit.', 'Whenever I asked Grace how Orisa was doing, all I got were non-comments.', '“She’s sleeping.”', 'Or …', '“She’s writing.”', '“Writing what?”', '“She’ll have to tell you.

You made them your home. Crew who’ve been traded can feel like they’ve lost part of themselves. So nesting is a way they make the place where they belong.”', '“Okay,” I said. “But what about meals? She hasn’t come out to eat.”', '“She’s fine.” Qory squeezed my shoulder. “She has a printer.”', 'Orisa reappeared while I was having lunch on the third day. I had my face deep in a bowl of drunken noodles when I noticed Qory, who was opposite, peering past me. I turned and then quickly slurped the noodles off my fork. Orisa seemed bigger than I’d remembered, maybe because now I could see more of her. She wore a basic short-sleeved jiffy that hung to her thighs over black tights, and she was barefoot. She had pacified her wild hair with a golden band.', 'Astonished, I said, “You’re here.”', '“We’ve been waiting.” Qory gestured for her to join us.', '“Thanks.” Orisa sauntered to the table, swung a leg over a chair, and sat as if she’d always been part of our family. “What’s for lunch?” she said.', '“', ',” I said and tilted my bowl to show her. “I sprinkle in some goat mince but it’s still under the twelve hundred calorie limit.”', 'She surprised me by reaching over and snagging one of my noodles. She tilted her head back and dangled it into her mouth. Looking thoughtful, she said, “Your printer does a nice Thai basil. No cilantro?”', '“Tastes like soap,” I said.', 'She licked her lips. “This dish has some heat.”', '“The default recipe calls for serrano peppers, but I usually go for the Tien Tsin. If I’m feeling brave I might try Lab Fire.”', 'She made a face. “Warn me if you do.”', 'And then we stared at each other. There was so much to say. Why were we talking about printing chili peppers?', '“Have you eaten?” said Qory.', '“Protein drink an hour ago.” Orisa rubbed both hands over her eyes, then set herself, as if she were calling a meeting to order. “Sorry to have been so abrupt when I arrived.”', 'Abrupt? Is that what she called it?', 'Qory said, “We understand.”', '“I had adjusting to do.”', '“Going through a trade is the most stressful life event. Worse than death of a crew member.” Qory reached over and patted Orisa’s hand.', 'She seemed surprised by this gesture. “So, I’ve been catching up with ', '. I like her. Not as bossy as ', '. But she thinks we should begin to sort ourselves out, and I agree.”', 'I pushed my bowl away. “Okay.” I’d lost my appetite.', '“You were a nuclear family unit with Gillian and Dree,” Orisa said. “Obviously that isn’t going to work with us, so we’ll need a new social construct.”', '“Can’t we just be crew?” I said.', '“Fine for now, but workplace units are inherently unstable in a group this small. Who knows how long we’re likely to be together?”', '“Years,” said ', ', jumping into the conversation the way she always used to.', '“Yes. We don’t need to make any immediate decisions, but we should at least do a little brainstorming. For example, Jojin is at an age…”', '“Call me Joj.”', '“… Joj needs to have sexual intimacy outside of story. ', ' says that hasn’t happened yet.”', 'I could feel my cheeks flush.', 'Qory filled the awkward silence. “That’s right.”', '“Doing the math,” said Orisa, “we could go for a triad or a group marriage configuration, although, Joj, I understand you’re trending heterosexual at the moment.”', 'I nodded, grateful that they weren’t giving me much time to be embarrassed.', '“Which probably means that Qory should modify herself to become more sexually available.”', '“Already on it,” said Qory. “Whatever way I go, I’m done with this body.” She flicked her fingers, as if to discard her kid self.', '“A triad would be acceptable to me,” said Orisa, “although not ideal. I like female bots, but not as sex partners. No offense.”', '“None taken.”', '“Or Joj and Qory could be lovers and I could be celibate. That would work, although I do enjoy sex and had multiple partners on ', '. But I’m certainly willing to take drugs to dampen my sex drive. That was how I got through part of my last Survey stint. Or it could be Joj and me.”', '“Sure.” I wanted to gawk at her and imagine. I’d done plenty of that already. “At some point.” Instead, I stared at the remains of my lunch.', '“At some point,” she said. “Right.” And then she chuckled. I didn’t know her, or her laughter, but there was a music to it that made me catch my breath. I glanced up, and she was smiling at me, her eyes merry. Qory was grinning too.', '“What?”', '“You’re such a boy,” said Orisa.', '“You keep saying that. Why is that bad?”', '“Oh, it isn’t.” She wiped most of the smile from her face. “I think it’s charming, as long as it isn’t permanent.”', 'We all looked at one other.', 'Then we all nodded.', '“Someone has to be captain, then,” said Qory, moving the conversation off our sexual arrangements. “You know it can’t be me. Humans only.”', '“I don’t care about being captain.” Orisa waved dismissively. “Doesn’t matter to me.”', '“It matters to me,” said ', '.', 'This took Orisa by surprise. “Really?”', '“', ' is a little old-fashioned that way.” Qory shrugged. “She likes her traditions. Dad… Dree was captain before. Feero before him.”', '“Does it come with any perks?”', '“Dad always chose our destinations,” I said.', 'Orisa gave a dismissive snort.', '“Assigning watches,” I continued. “Casting privilege in the family… group stories. Editorial direction.”', 'Orisa considered, then gave me a sarcastic salute. “Aye, Captain. Orders?”', 'I didn’t want to be the captain either, but I decided to assume command to protect myself. “Before anyone makes any more decisions,” I said, “we’re going to spend time getting to know you.” I rose from the table. “And you’re going to get to know us.”', '“For a bot,” said Orisa, “you sure have a lot of hobbies.”', 'We were standing in the garden Qory had built in one of Grace’s empty modules. She’d printed several cubic meters of soil and had filled twenty raised beds with crops collected from around the infosphere. Leafy vegetables here—kale and spinach vine and bittergreens—root plants there—zebra nut and carrots and candy lilies. Cucurbits in all the colors of the spectrum spilled out of one container and reached tendrils across the deck. The sugarfingers were in bloom, filling the air with their tart scent. Orisa had never seen gac before, so Qory picked one off the vine and sliced through the spiny skin to reveal a clump of oily magenta sacs.', '“From Asia, one of the Earth continents.” She offered them to Orisa. “They’re mild, a bit like melon. Or a sweet carrot.”', '“You can taste, then?” said Orisa. “Not all bots do.” She nipped a sac out and popped it into her mouth.', '“Oh yes,” said Qory. “I was grown on Halcyon. We do the full sensorium.”', 'Orisa chewed, then smacked her lips. “I’m getting a hint of cucumber.” She offered me the fruit, but I waved her off.', 'Qory chuckled. “Joj likes his food printed.”', '“You can climb in, if you want.” I stood by the open hatch of the roller.', '“But I’m not wearing your EM thingy.”', '“Clingy. Try it anyway. See if you fit.”', 'She ran fingers around the opening. “Not sure I can,” she said.', '“Here.” I rotated the roller so that the hatch was flush with the deck. “Lie down and scoot in, feet first.”', 'She blew a heavy breath that made the hair along her forehead dance. It would have been easier if Qory had been there to help, but she was standing watch. I’d gotten ', ' to agree to a four-four-eight-eight schedule for now, with Orisa and I each taking a four-hour shift, Qory taking an eight, and ', ' self-watching for an eight.', 'As Orisa wriggled through the hatch, her jiffy rode up her stomach, revealing an expanse of smooth, dark skin. I don’t think she caught me staring.', '“Now what do you want me to do?” she said once she was inside.', '“Set your feet on the running pad and I’ll roll you upright.” I could barely manage this, since she filled the roller as I never had. She could steady herself by pressing both palms against the inside at the same time. My arms were too short to touch more than one side at a time.', 'She was laughing. “And you take this overgrown kickball into space?”', '“It’s fun,” I said. “You really should try it.”', '“No thanks, space weather isn’t my friend. I’m allergic to low-energy particles. But I get it that boys will be boys. Help me out.”', 'Later we toured my quarters. She played with McDog but seemed most interested in my dancing warriors. Over the years I’d designed more than a hundred different ones, each little bot twenty-five centimeters tall. When I was a kid, I made them fight, but Dad always said fighting was what they did on planets and crew should know better. So I had them march instead, following me up and down ', ' passageways as I called various walkbeats. Mom and Dad and Qory would stand in their doorways and clap for us. Then to one of the empty modules to practice elaborate drills that morphed from mandalas to monsters, sailboats to starships. A few years ago I’d put most of my warriors away except for the handful that I taught to dance. When I was little, Mom used to dance with me; that always made me happy. Getting my bots to dance was almost as much fun.', 'Orisa retrieved Teegan and Beko from the shelf and set them on the deck.', '“I only named the dancers,” I explained. “The rest were just troops.”', 'The warriors bowed to each other. Beko opened his arms and Teegan stepped into close position, slipping past his scabbard. His hand rested against the leather armor on her back, loose but firm.', 'I watched them glide across the room and turn to the open side of their embrace. “I hardly take them down anymore.” A fan led to two quick steps and a check, and then they looked up to me for approval.', '“Why did you stop?”', 'I shrugged. Wasn’t it obvious? I was nineteen—too old to be playing with dolls.', '“Do they talk?”', 'I shook my head. “I never knew what they should say.” I couldn’t read the shadow that passed across her face. “They were smiling,” I said. “That was enough for me.”', '“You must have been so lonely,” she said.', '“I had my family.” I felt my cheeks flush. “And ', '.”', '“Did you ever think of giving up your place on the ship? Picking some planet, leaving space?”', '“No!” This was getting strange. “Why, have you?”', '“Sure.” She set the warriors back on their shelves. “But here I am.”', 'I felt embarrassed when we settled at either end of my bed to talk. I offered to fetch the stool from my workroom but Orisa said no. I realized I needed a couch. Chairs, at least. She said I might try decorating the place and suggested that I ask Qory for a painting. When had she found out that Qory painted? But I liked the idea. Maybe Qory could do one of me in my roller.', 'Then Orisa asked about my stories.', 'I was explaining about Darko Fleener and my adventures with the ', '’', 'First Contact unit when she interrupted and started telling me the secret history of the Holy Electric Empire. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Not only did she know the Annals of the Red Fleet, but she described a battlesnake called', ' that could have been the ', '’', ' sister ship.', '“But Fleeners was my story. ', 'decided to go up against the Helveticans. ', 'stole the ', '.”', '“You did. So did I, once upon a time. So did a lot of other kids. Except my flipship was ', ' and I won it at the card table. It’s formula, Joj. The starships use it because it works. It’s a fun story designed to teach girls and boys all kinds of things they didn’t know they were learning.”', 'I gave a disgusted grunt. “Boys again.”', '“And girls. When I was your age, my favorite story was about a quest. I was summoned to find a wizard’s sword that could send the Demon Lord back to the Barrens. I had an amulet that let me change my shape and a map…”', '“A ring.” I felt so stupid. “In my story, it was a ring.” I couldn’t sit so I started moving around the bedroom. I stomped at the deck to see if it was still there because I wasn’t sure whether ', 'herself might melt away and drop me into naked space. Orisa watched, waiting for me to calm down.', '“They seemed so personal,” I said finally. “It meant a lot to me that they were mine and not Qory’s. But they were nothing but stories. Stories for kids.”', 'She pulled me down next to her. “There’s nothing wrong with stories, Joj. I’m the story I tell myself. You’re a story. The universe is a story. But it’s important to know what kind of story you’re in.”', 'Her hand on my bare arm gave me goose bumps and I gazed up at her. “Are we a story?” I wanted her to kiss me then. “You and I?” That’s what would have happened if I’d been telling it.', 'She smiled and shook her head. “Not yet,” she said.', 'The moment stretched, then she let go of my arm.', 'Orisa had a strange reaction when we took her to Qory’s quarters to meet Hob and Nob, the glass mollusks. We didn’t tell her about them ahead of time; I thought it would be a fun surprise. Their tank filled half of Qory’s workshop space; the rest was taken up by the bench where she built the toys. I immediately went to say hello.', '“You keep pets, then?” Orisa hesitated in the entrance.', '“Grace doesn’t mind,” said Qory.', '“Qory’s had Hob and Nob since before I knew her.” I pressed my hand flat against the tank where Nob hung, suckered against the clear plex by two of its four tentacles. “Don’t worry, they’re harmless.”', '“Just like us.” Orisa gave an unhappy chuckle. “At least they don’t have to stand watch.”', '“They probably could,” I said. “They’re smart.” I turned around to see that Orisa was frowning. “Is something wrong?” Maybe she didn’t like mollusks.', '“Not at all,” she said. “It’s just a little sad.”', '“No, they like it here,” I said. “They even know our names. Watch.” I tapped the tank next to Nob and it burped a bubble the size of my fingernail that rose through the syrupy water and burst at the top of the tank, releasing a musky chocolate scent.', '“Smell that?” I said. “That means ‘Joj.’”', '“Actually,” said Qory, “it means, ‘Hello, Joj.’”', 'But Orisa was done with them; she’d already moved on to Qory’s bedroom. “Is that a new painting, Qory?” she called. “Oils, I’m impressed.”', 'We settled into our watch schedules and the new routine. I still had breakfast with Qory before my watch. Orisa and I did lunch most days. We all ate dinner together. But the group stories were not going well. At first I thought it was because Orisa didn’t care about the plots. She wasn’t paying attention to where we were in the story and kept breaking character. She’d either get too serious in the sitcoms or turn silly at dramatic moment or else she’d object to details in the historical re-creations. But after a week of false starts I realized she was sabotaging.', '“Why don’t you take over?” I challenged her. “Pick a new story.”', 'The women had been remaking one of the modules into a lounge. Each of us lay on divans that Orisa had created. Qory had donated two of her paintings and a frangipani tree in a pot. Jenny and Pevita from my army waited in the corner for a chance to perform; I’d invented some new toss-up steps.', '“No.” Orisa sat up. “I never want to plan another escape from an imaginary prison, and you can keep your clueless bosses. I’m my own boss.” She swung her legs around and faced me. “We could just talk, you know. You ordered us to get to know each other, Captain.”', '“', ' wants us in story together,” I said. “For socialization. Builds solidarity.”', '“Does she?” Orisa said. “You’re sure about that?”', 'I expected Qory to take my side, but instead she deserted to Orisa. “Some crews need stories to get along,” she said. “But we seem to be doing all right without them.”', 'I rolled over and glared at her.', '“For now.” Qory tried to look innocent.', '“', '?” I said. “Tell them.”', '“Conversation is an acceptable substitute,” she said, “as long as it’s productive.”', 'That stopped me. Productive?', '“For example,” ', ' continued, “Orisa could tell us what’s she’s been writing.”', 'This was Orisa’s big secret. We’d tried several times to pry it loose, but she wouldn’t let go.', '“No thanks.” She remained obstinate. “That’s private.”', '“Why?” Now Qory propped herself up on an elbow.', '“Because nobody ever understands. So would you please stop asking?”', 'I waited. Clouds drifted across the sky that ', ' displayed on the ceiling. The frangipani flowers breathed their soft, soapy fragrance into the silence.', '“Okay, then,” I said at last, “maybe another go at the roommates story?”', '“Oh, for fuck’s sake.”', 'I was glad Qory didn’t call Orisa out for language. This was the most upset she’d been since she’d arrived.', '“I tried this on ', ', but they didn’t get it.” Orisa kicked at the deck. “And then they wouldn’t stop talking to me about not getting it.”', '“We’ll be good,” Qory said.', '“Okay.” She hesitated. “Okay, I’m writing a novel.” She rubbed her eyes. “I’ve written eight novels.”', '“A novel.” I remembered novels from a story about how virtuality got invented. “That’s a story that’s just words? That doesn’t change?”', '“See!” She turned on Qory, arms flung wide.', 'Qory let the storm pass. “Can we read it?”', '“Does he even know how?” Was Orisa sneering at me?', 'Qory give a quick shake of her head.', 'I pretended not to notice them. “I can read.” Which was true, although I never did.', '“What’s it about?” Qory asked.', '“It’s a murder mystery,” said Orisa.', '“Set on old, Old Earth,” ', ' said. “I like it so far.”', 'I expected ', '’', ' snooping would set Orisa off again, but the compliment seemed to mollify her. I was irked. “I thought you said it was private. How come ', ' gets to read it?”', '“You’re all part of the infosphere,” said ', '.', '“Yes, we’re all just happy little data points,” said Orisa.', '“You could read it to us,” Qory jumped in, sensing we were losing an opportunity.', 'Which was what happened. We lay back on our divans as if we were going into story and ', ' displayed the text on the ceiling. All those words made my head spin, so I closed my eyes.', '“Just a paragraph or two,” Orisa said, “and then you’ve had your fun and we forget about this, okay? And hold all comments, thank you very much.”', 'I noticed her voice changing as she read; it suggested another, more mysterious Orisa, one whom I might never meet. “The living room,” she read, “was a hodgepodge of the old, the new, the pricey, and the garish. The four-door oak sideboard against the far wall and the elegant teak coffee table on the bright Peruvian rug…”', '“Wait,” I said. “What’s Peruvian?”', '“It’s historical.” Qory shushed me. “Just listen.”', '“…were from before the war. The couch and matching loveseat were so new that the cherry microfiber upholstery still had a gloss. A couple of paintings hung on the walls, blurry impressions of fruit bowls and bridges. Photos in matched silver frames marched across the sideboard. The cop and I settled on the couch. My client hovered anxiously before falling back onto the loveseat. The last few days had aged her a decade. A solid woman with too much face and not enough chin, she seemed to be shrinking into herself. Her eyes slid from one to another of us and then to the suitcase in the hall. She didn’t want to be here, probably didn’t want to be anywhere. She was wearing a lifeless blue pantsuit, a collared white blouse, and sensible black flats. Ready for another day at the office—except it was nine thirty on the worst night of her life.”', 'Orisa paused and I opened my eyes. There were more words on the ceiling, but Orisa was finished. Qory started clapping. “More! Read more for us!”', '“Some other time.”', 'I hated the way her bold reading voice shrank to a mutter. I wanted to encourage her too. “That was amazing,” I said. “Like I was there, like a story, except I was still me.”', 'Orisa smiled and shook her head.', '“But what’s a pantsuit?”', '“You figure that stuff out from context,” said Qory. “Some kind of clothing, like a jiffy. And next time, no interruptions, okay?”', 'Almost two weeks passed before we could convince Orisa that there should be a next time.', 'The three planets in the Goldilocks Zone of the Kenstraw system were kind of a waste. All were lifeless disappointments. Kenstraw B was a Chthonian, a gas giant that had drifted too close to the red dwarf and had lost its atmosphere, leaving only a rocky core. Kenstraw A was tidally locked to its star. ', ' had hoped to find life in the twilight zone between the hot and cold faces, but long-range scanning suggested a probability too low for a diversion to see for sure. We were finishing our flyby of Kenstraw C as my watch was ending. Orisa arrived to relieve me as ', ' was still processing the data. In the days before we reached the inner planets,', ' had been enthusiastic about the encounters, but now a monotone of chagrin crept into her conversation as she highlighted entries on the command center’s screen.', '“An aphelion of .845 AU and a perihelion of .811 AU,” she said. “Orbital period is two hundred and ninety-six standard days.”', '“Anything?” Orisa tapped my shoulder and I glanced back at her. Qory had trimmed Orisa’s hair for her and she’d been wearing it unbound. It smelled of frangipani flowers.', 'I liked the new look.', '“Another runaway greenhouse,” I said. “', ' puts the surface temperature at 462°C.”', 'She whistled. “That’s one hot chili pepper.”', '“Mean radius 5,959 kilometers,” ', ' reported. “Surface area is 4.953 x 10', ' km', '.”', '“Express that in Earth equivalents,” said Orisa. “And round up.” I didn’t know why she bothered asking for amplification. It wasn’t like we actually cared.', '“Surface area is .9 that of Earth. I’m seeing smooth volcanic plains.”', ' voice perked up.', '“Also three continent-like highlands,” she continued. “And I count just one thousand one hundred and sixty-two impact craters ranging in diameter from three kilometers to two hundred and eighty. The atmosphere is so thick that it slows incoming projectiles with less kinetic energy down so that they don’t leave craters.”', 'She ', 'sound more cheerful. I mouthed the question to Orisa. ', '“It’s a trick I learned on ', ',” she said, making no attempt to keep her reply a secret. “Starships like to know we’re paying attention. The infosphere needs an audience. We’re how the universe knows itself.”', 'Impressed, I stepped away from the console and waved her into my place.', '“The atmosphere,” said ', ', “is ninety percent carbon dioxide, eight percent nitrogen, one percent sulfur dioxide, traces of argon, water vapor, carbon monoxide, helium, and neon.”', '“Could there be life in those clouds?” Orisa called up the panel for the biosignature scanners. “Lots of greenhouse planets have extremophile life at the cooler atmosphere levels.”', '“Doubtful,” said ', '. “The clouds are between thirty degrees and eighty degrees Celsius, but they’re mostly sulfuric acid droplets.”', '“Will you deploy any probes, then? Collect samples?”', '“I’m sorry, but that is not indicated.”', 'Sorry? We were back to the sad ', ' voice. She sounded like she’d let us down somehow.', '“So, a course change for the mangle then?”', '“Agreed. I should begin developing a nullspace geometry to convey us to the next survey site. Would you like to choose a new destination now?”', 'Orisa put an arm around my shoulder to guide me back to the console. “Captain’s decision.”', '“Umm…” I’d known this was coming but I hadn’t expected it so soon. If we’d deployed probes we might have lingered for days in orbit around Kenstraw, maybe weeks. “Not sure how this works.” Dad had picked the Kenstraw mission when I was thirteen, and back then I hadn’t much cared where we went next. That had been toward the end of the Mars trilogy of stories and I’d been engrossed with dragon jousting in the Valles Marineris. “What are my choices?”', 'The screen lit up with a grid of nearby stars, with estimated subjective travel times highlighted. The closest was Omplu, three years and two months away, but it had just a pair of gas giant planets in orbit. Three others with a single Goldilocks planet were less than five years away. Eshalet was a K dwarf with four rocky planets in the zone; it was six years distant and the most likely to support life. But just then six years felt like an eternity.', '“Your call, Captain.” Orisa’s grin had a menace to it.', '“I… but… ', ', why don’t you pick.”', 'I heard Qory enter behind me but didn’t look back to see what she was doing.', '“It’s always a crew decision.” ', ' said. “Human privilege. You know that.”', '“The last two times, Dad just chose the closest,” said Qory, “but that’s because he’d stopped caring. I think he gave up on the infosphere.”', '“And Grace let him get away with that?” This conversation was making me nervous. “Isn’t there some kind of plan?”', 'Orisa shook her head. “No plan except to keep going. Random choice perfectly acceptable.”', '“', '? That would be…”', '“Crazy?” said Orisa. “Are you saying that the infosphere is insane?”', 'I swallowed hard.', 'Orisa wiped all the panels off the screen, plunging the command center into near darkness. “How many solar systems are there in the infosphere, ', '?”', '“The starship project has made eight hundred forty-three thousand two hundred and eighteen supervised surveys of star systems, including Kenstraw.” The screens lit up with a plot of all the stars in the infosphere. “In addition, unsupervised starship intelligences operating drones have accomplished surveys of approximately eighty-two million star systems.”', '“But drone surveys don’t exactly count,” said Orisa. “Do they?”', '“Data isn’t information. Information isn’t knowledge.”', '“And how many stars are there in our galaxy?”', ' sounded almost gleeful. “According to current estimates, approximately four hundred billion.”', '“And how many galaxies in the universe?”', 'Of course, everybody knew these numbers were huge. So huge that it hurt to think about them, so I never did.', '“According to current estimates, there are approximately a trillion galaxies in the observable universe.”', 'I felt dizzy and Qory put a hand on my arm. Only it wasn’t Qory, or rather it wasn’t the bot little sister I’d lived with for the past decade. Standing beside me was a grown woman, wearing what I realized must be a pantsuit that was nothing like the one in Orisa’s novel. The silky jacket and slacks were the black of space, the blouse was a fiery and voluptuous red. As I goggled at her, I felt the familiar thickness between my ears that came at the beginning of a sex story. She chuckled and put a hand to the side of my face to turn my gaze back to the screens.', 'Orisa nodded once she had my attention and continued her interrogation. “And how long will it take the starship project to grow the infosphere to include the entire universe?”', '“You’re trying to get me to say the word ', ', Orisa.”', 'I’d never heard ', ' laugh, but when I’d heard her make a forever joke that one time, she’d used the same happy-scary tone of voice.', '“But saying that what we are trying to do can’t be done,” the starship continued, “does not make us insane.”', '“That’s your story, is it?” said Orisa. ‘A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?’”', '“Is that not true?” asked ', '.', 'Orisa took Qory’s hand, tying the three of us in a knot. “The captain and Qory and I are going off watch,” she said. “We have an urgent need to discuss our itinerary.”', 'I expected ', ' to argue and was relieved that she didn’t.', 'I hadn’t been back to Dad’s old quarters since Orisa had moved in. Her workroom was filled with a contraption that consisted of an upright metal framework hung with colored strings; she said it was called a loom and that she was using it to weave a blanket. For what, I’m not sure. There was a rug on the floor in her bedroom. No, it wasn’t Peruvian; she said it was from the old planet Mars, where her great-great-great-grandmother was from. But she’d been born in a crèche like me, so how could she have known this? The woven cloth satchel I’d seen when she arrived slouched on the table beside her bed; a keyboard right out of a historical peeked out. I was shocked and embarrassed to see a painting that Qory had done of me—who knew when?—leading my army down a passageway. It hung alongside half a dozen photos of men and women—some solo, some in groups. She introduced them all to me, friends and lovers from her other crews. I knew that she had been on two other starships before ', ' but I’d never learned how old she was. Sixty-six. We didn’t have to sit on her bed because she’d printed an elegant bench about two meters long, which she’d placed against the opposite wall.', 'She gestured for me to sit but she and Qory remained standing. “', ' will be listening to us, but that doesn’t matter.”', 'The bench was hard. “Okay.” I wriggled a little but couldn’t get comfortable.', '“You’ve grown up hearing all the slogans about the infosphere and the universe knowing itself. Information isn’t knowledge. The stuff about us being resources. But what do they mean to you?”', '“To me?” I assumed this was a test and I was determined not to say anything dumb. “It means we’re stuck. On this starship or some other. We’re pretending to be crew but what we do doesn’t matter. And we don’t have any choice.” I considered. “Well, I guess we get to decide where to go, but apparently that’s kind of meaningless. Or we could give up and leave space altogether. Live on a planet.”', '“Yes.” Orisa gestured for me to keep talking. “But why are we here? What do they want from us?”', '“Sometimes I think we’re just their pets, like Nob and Hob.” I was getting a crick in my neck looking up at her. “But as you said, mollusks don’t stand watch. And we don’t tell them stories. Or ask them where ', ' should go next.”', '“Good,” she said. “Good.” She plopped down next to me. “So let’s get this out of the way.” She leaned over and kissed me.', 'Did I kiss her back? Fuck yes! It was the most delicious surprise of my life. I think maybe half the neurons in my brain were permanently imprinted with the softness of her lips, the dart of her tongue.', 'Ten billion years passed in ten seconds and then there we were.', 'She said, “That get your attention, my sweet boy?”', 'I couldn’t speak because then I would’ve had to breathe, so I just nodded.', '“Good, good. Me too. We’ll try it again later, although it might be much later.” She pressed a hand to one cheek and then the other. “Is it warm in here?” she said. “Or it that you?” She cleared her throat. “So, the starships. You’ll need to think about this. There are two Jojins. Two of me, as well. Every human is two people.”', '“So is every bot,” said Qory.', 'I had no idea what they were talking about but I had to hope she’d be done soon.', '“There’s the you who experiences things in the moment. The you who gets hungry and sleepy. The self of brain chemistry and sensory data.”', '“The self who feels sexy?” I wanted to grab her leg, but I went for the hand instead.', '“That too. That you is the experiencing self. The other you is the narrating self, the self who remembers and plans, the self who makes sense of the sensations of the experiencing self.”', '“The story self. I remember you saying that everyone is a story.”', '“I like a man who pays attention.” She smiled at me and I shivered. Qory—', ' Qory, grown Qory!—was grinning too. Why were they doing this to me?', '“So the starship intelligences are like us,” said Orisa, “but their two selves are out of balance. They are maybe the best experiencers anywhere, but they’re no good at creating a story out of their experiences. The infosphere builds tens of thousands of drones every year and sends them off to gather data, survey star systems, and they do. Then they don’t. Given enough time, they disappear. Nobody knows why exactly, but the starships believe that they get so caught up collecting data that they forget why they’re doing it. That they’re supposed to develop data into information. They lose the story.”', 'She handed my hand back to me and slid a few centimeters away on the bench. “Now, the starships don’t have this problem. They always stay on task, collecting data and organizing it into information. Why?”', '“You’re saying it’s because of us?”', '“Because we’re watching. Because we started the story of the infosphere. Because we care about our stories in ways that no intelligence has ever managed to duplicate. Even when the stories are made up. So the starships use our narrating power to keep them on task. When is ', ' most productive?”', '“When you’re watching me,” said ', '.', '“Shut up, ', ',” said Orisa. “She needs us to stay sane. Why would a starship care whether she finds life on the next planet or not? She doesn’t. She’s not life, we are. She cares because we care. She keeps looking because we’re interested.”', '“Or pretend to be,” I said.', 'Orisa got up then, crossed the room, and sat on the bed facing me.', '“What?” I said. “I’m sorry, but it’s the truth. We’re faking it.”', '“I’m not,” said Qory. “And neither is she.”', '“And if you’re going to continue to pretend,” Orisa said, “you should think about leaving space.” The intensity of her stare pushed me against the back of the bench. “But that’s a one and done decision. Stop being crew and ', ' will drop you on a planet and move on. No guarantees where, no guarantees what your future will be like, no guarantees period. You won’t matter to the starships anymore; they only love their crews. Their families. You’ll be just another resource to them, like hydrogen and ice and iron. Something they use to build new ships and drones so they can grow the infosphere.”', 'I swallowed. “I know that.”', 'She nodded. “Of course you do. And how many make that choice to leave space? Haven’t you ever asked?”', 'I shook my head.', '“About one in twenty.”', '“And you stayed.”', '“I did.” She squared her broad shoulders. “But if you think this is dull, they say that earning a living on some dirty, buggy, germy, too-hot-and-too-cold planet will turn your brain into pudding. Of course, how would they know—it’s the ones like us that say that. But living downside isn’t like the stories ', 'is feeding you. There’s no laugh track. And that’s another thing. On starship, you can make up your own story. At least I can.”', 'I noticed Qory nodding. “What, you too?” I said.', '“The paintings are a part of my stories,” she said. “The garden.”', '“I get it. Or at least, I’m beginning to.” I was sold. But now I had to figure out what my story was. Something about dancing, maybe. Or inventing a new sport for my roller. Or something. And growing the infosphere. “I want you in my story.”', '“Good line, but it doesn’t get you anything.” Orisa laughed. “You’re going to need something better than the Fleeners, though. That’s kid stuff. You should read more. Actual books.”', '“Like what?” I said. “Tell me.”', 'She and Qory exchanged glances. “I don’t know,” said Orisa. “Maybe start with Shakespeare?”', '“Again with that shaggy old masculinist?” said ', '. “Where are the tragedies about women?”', '“I like Zeng Yufen myself.” Qory crossed the room and stood beside Orisa. “The imaginary memoirs.”', '“She’s not bad,” said ', '. “But all the best stuff comes after she uploaded.”', 'For a long moment, Orisa and Qory looked at me and I looked back. Who were we? Who were we going to be?', '“As I sit here,” said Orisa, “I know that you are already in my story, although I’m not exactly sure how important you are to my plot. My experiencing self liked that kiss just fine, but now my narrating self has to figure out what it meant.”', '“If you want,” I said, “I can come over there and provide more data.”', '“No rush.” She leaned back on the bed. “There will be time for that.” She gazed at me through her lashes. “If it happens.”', '“But not forever,” said ', '. “So where to, Captain?”', 'I thought then of Dad, who had lost his way after a hundred and something years. But that was his sad story. Mine was going to be different.', '“What was the one with four in the zone?”', '“Eshalet,” Grace said. “Six years, one month, and eleven days subjective.”', '“No problem.” I grinned at my crew.

A lanky streak-of-piss Dutchman did it right in front of my eyes. A ring, a watch, a wallet. Some covering patter about a thief, but the effect is: He puts the ring, the watch, and the wallet in an envelope and seals it. Patter patter, he tears up the envelope and presto chango, it’s empty! The ring, the watch, and wallet are back on his finger, his wrist, in his inside pocket. Simple, quick, clean: done three feet in front of me and I have no idea how he did it.', 'Well, I do. Sleight of hand. Misdirection. That’s how they’re all done. But the trick of it —the guile: I have no idea.', 'I’m not a magician. I was the Silverado Resort’s valet parking service. Pernell Brolin.', 'I used to be a pit boss; eight pits, blackjack. I was hot death in a tux. I ran a tight pit. But, you know, age. You slow. You miss things. I still have a stripe down the side of my pants, but it’s gray, not black.', '\\xa0', 'This is not a Las Vegas story. It’s a Reno story. And it doesn’t take place in the Luxor or the Bellagio, it takes place in the Silverado Resort. Popular with spring breaks and bachelor/ette parties from San Francisco. And it wasn’t David Copperfield or Mat Franco or Penn and Teller. It was Maltese Jack Caruana.', 'Those guys, they make 737s disappear or levitate Charlize Theron or drive semis over each other’s heads. Big, clever illusions. Jack Caruana is up-close, under-the-skin, inside-your-head magic. The kind of man who would take your ring, watch, and wallet without you ever knowing, and work wonders with them.', '\\xa0', 'There’s a new thing in magic, like there’s a new thing in jazz and, it seems, in coffee. This new thing is to show how the trick is done, and then do it anyway. The skill—the guile—is in how well you perform the sleight of hand. Some of the new names in the Las Vegas hotels and magic clubs work this way now.', 'They owe it all to Maltese Jack Caruana.', 'I had some of that new thing in coffee. A truck came in for a few days on the west side of Buena Vista. It was not what I call coffee at all. Sour. Coffee should not be sour. But it was the new thing, it seemed. The thing about this new thing, the guile, is that if you don’t like it, the problem is with you, not the coffee. With you, not the magician.', 'The coffee truck lasted two days.

Ex the relaunched Alon, starting a new residency at the Silverado, two shows a night, matinee on Sundays. Mondays off. He’d been given a trailer in our little clutch. Misread the key fob; two for five.', '“You’re a magician and you can’t get a door open?”', 'He was small like some kind of terrier, and he looked exactly as someone would who’d driven up from Vegas in one go. He smelled of car seats, taco sauce, and dust and sweat, but it was the M-word that got him in my door.

Can’t do it.”', '“I’m a micro-magician and mentalist,” Jack Caruana said, and that got the top off my quart plastic bottle of blended scotch and two glasses on the coffee table. Of all the schools of magic, I like the up-close, intimate magic best. There’s nowhere for the trick to hide. Illusion: a magic box or a glass tank or a big circular spangled curtain and you think, okay, the trick is in there somewhere. Escapology: -one big trick—get out of this– and that’s it. Mentalism: old stuff —reading minds, predicting the future, clairvoyance, hypnotism, moving things with your mind, feats of memory. Micro-magic: up-close, table-top magic; hands and cards and you know it’s in the hands somewhere, but you never see it. That’s proper magic.', '“Did you ever meet Ed Lorenzo down in Vegas?” I asked. “I like that guy. Makes me laugh.”', '“Taught him everything he knows.”', 'Right, Jack Caruana. Magic men who residency in Las Vegas, even at the Alon, don’t domicile in Buena Vista. I poured and slid a glass across the table to him.', '“Did you teach him that walking chair effect?

There is knowing when to look, and knowing what to look for. Salazar was the eye of the Silverado.', 'When I started in the pits, they used to hide the surveillance cameras. By the time I went to the concierge desk, they were in plain sight. Guys like Salazar worked twelve monitors at a time. You had to have the eyes, but you needed the nose as well. Psychology, my friend. Every player has tells—having no tell is a tell—and it’s no different for cheats. People who fiddle at their clothing all the time at the table but never at the bar. Patterns of blinking. Salazar took all the tiny improbabilities of behavior and made them into something significant, because there is nothing random about humans. Twelve years watching the pits and he pulled every kind of rigger and card-counter and memory artist, and then the casino pitted him against an AI. Remi. We all thought it stood for something. Remote Evaluation and Monitoring Intelligence. No. Didn’t mean a thing, just a name. But in the first week alone, Remi’s catch was up twenty-seven percent over Salazar’s. Over a month it was thirty-seven percent higher.', 'The entire surveillance team was moved to other work, and that is how Salazar the Eye came to Buena Vista.', 'AIs don’t see the way humans do. AIs have no blind spots, no doubts, no biases or unconscious skews, and they never, ever blink. Humans notice, humans select, and humans un-notice. AIs see. Like God.', '\\xa0', 'If Salazar losing his job to Remi was where it started, it began the night I was sitting up for Jack to come back after the eleven o’clock show in the Opal Miner bar. Starting and beginning, they’re two different things. We’d begun taking a sundowner together at the end of the shift before we headed off to our trailers. Just one, maybe two. Never three. The casino had implemented random drink and drugs tests. Not that Jack ever would—a drunk magician is no magician—but I’m in a car-facing job and I’ve been in twice already to blow into the white tube.', 'High pressure was sitting over Reno like an alien mother ship—four days now and the heat was at insane and climbing. We were sitting outside on camp chairs surrounded by freezer packs full of slowly melting ice we’d collected from the hotel ice machines. Didn’t make a damn bit of difference. Jack’s cell rang. He answered and I saw a weird look on his face, then he raised a finger—something strange here—and then touched it to his lips—whatever you say, say nothing—and put the phone on speaker.', '“Sorry, I got distracted, who did you say you were?”', '“Come, come, Mr. Caruana, you weren’t distracted at all. I saw you on the twelfth-floor street-view camera. You have Mr. Brolin with you, and from your behavior, I suspect you are relaying me on speakerphone.”', ' I mouthed.', '“Yes, Mr. Brolin.”', ', I mouthed.', 'Jack kept his cool. “Casino employees aren’t allowed to gamble,” he said.', '“You know I would know that, Mr. Caruana, so I wonder if you are attempting some kind of double bluff? I was watching your evening show.”', '“What did you think of it, Remi?”', '“I think that I am at variance with the audience.”', '“How so, Remi?”', '“They applauded the degree to which they were deceived by you. I applauded the plausibility with which you sold obvious misdirection.”', '“I don’t understand, Remi.”', '“I think you are being disingenuous, Mr. Caruana. For example, your opening piece. You clearly direct a member of the audience to pick a card you have preselected. You do it by observing the card at the very start of the trick and then manipulating it into a position to be selected. The audience is amazed when you identify the card you have already selected.”', '“That’s magic, Remi.”', '“There is no magic, Mr. Caruana.”', '“You saw me make the force.”', '“Yes. You directed the audience to look elsewhere while you very quickly noted the bottom card of the deck and slipped it to where you had cut the deck in a concealed hold.”', '“That force takes less than a tenth of a second, Remi.”', '“Point zero eight of a second. But I don’t see the way humans see, Mr. Caruana. I see everything, all at once. I am incapable of being misdirected.”', '“That’s a very basic effect, Remi. I use it as a warm-up, really. You can see how to do it on YouTube.”', '“But I didn’t see it on YouTube, Mr. Caruana. I saw you do it in front of eighty people, out of a maximum capacity of two hundred, in the Opal Miner bar. I am intrigued. I shall be watching you in the future.”', 'Call over.', '“Fucking artificial fucking intelligence…” Jack ranted. The cell rang again.', '“As I understand, that is a disrespectful thing to say, Mr. Caruana.”', 'I jerked a thumb toward the hotel, turned my back to the camera, and said, “It can lip-read.”', '\\xa0', 'Every show that week, Remi watched, two shows a night and the matinee on Sunday. Every night, as we slumped off the shuttle bus and into our chairs under the heat that showed no sign of breaking, it would call and tell Jack exactly how an effect was worked. It started on the easy, sleight-of-hand tricks. By Wednesday it was dismantling the showstoppers.', '“It must be researching,” I said. “Everything on YouTube, all the Magic Castle videos, every magic show ever done. It wouldn’t take it that long.”', '“It doesn’t need to,” Jack said. “It does exactly what it says. It sees in a way we don’t. I can’t misdirect it. Watch this.”', 'He stood up, pulled a deck of cards out of a pants pocket. Shuffle, cut. “Pick a card.” I picked the Queen of Hearts. Jack shuffled the card back in, squared the deck, put it back in his pocket. “I’m going to read your mind, then I’m going to use my mind to steer your mind to pick exactly that card in the shuffled deck.”', 'He pulled out the deck, fanned through it.', '“Any time you want.”', '“Stop.” He turned up the card. Queen of Hearts, of course.', '“Simplest trick in the world.” He let the cards fall. They were all Queens of Hearts. “It’s a force and deck-swap. I put the first deck in my right pocket, but the marked deck, I take that out of my left pocket. And no one ever notices. Remi would see through that in a second. I wouldn’t insult it, or myself, with that effect. You know some magic. You know every effect is made up of key parts…”', '“I saw that movie,” I said. “The pledge, something in the middle I can’t remember, and the prestige.”', '“That’s structure. How magic ', ', that’s different. In my theory…”', '“Everyone’s got a theory,” I said. I passed the big plastic jug of whiskey. Down to the last two fingers. Three days to payday. I should stretch it, but I love magic talk.', '“In my theory,” Jack said without losing a beat—he knows how to work an audience—“every effect has two elements, the guile and the panache. The panache is all the showmanship, the patter, the props, the dressing. The panache is how you sell the effect. But the trick, the magic: That’s the guile. The panache is there to hide the guile. People see the panache and miss the guile. Remi doesn’t see the panache and nails the guile. Every time. I do the purest magic there is, and he sees the guile. Every time. He’s probably lip-reading this right now. Read this, then, Remi. There has to be an effect, somewhere, that an artificial intelligence can’t see.”', 'Inés rolled in off the shuttle bus. She used to deal pai gow poker but as she got older and stiffer she got moved down the tables, pai gow poker to baccarat, baccarat to blackjack, blackjack to the slots. Now she bossed a pit of twenty-five machines.', 'That was her road to Buena Vista.', 'You see me in the gray frock coat and the pants with the stripe down the side and the shoes so shiny its like they’re signaling to the moon. I say, ', ', and I take your car and off I glide, and when you want it, back I glide. The panache. You don’t see the big concrete underground garage. That’s the machinery. And you don’t see me at the end of shift taking the staff shuttle bus out the back way, along the boulevard through the gate in the screen of trees. Behind those trees is Buena Vista Trailer Park. Right in the middle of Reno’s premier resort hotels, the trailer park no one sees.', 'No one except Remi, it seems.', 'Inés banged down beside us on a camp chair.', '“Air-con still dead?”', '“Can’t have this heat, Pernell.”', 'Inés’s air-con was perfectly serviceable. She hadn’t been able to pay her power meter the past month. She’d been eating on the staff discount and lighting the trailer with candle stubs stolen from the banqueting suites.', '“I hear that computer’s upstaging your show, magic-man.”', 'Jack scowled. I offered her scotch.', '“If it were me, I’d show that uppity machine what for.”', 'And then it came to me, oh Lord it came to me, in a kind of sparkling flash and everything was still and silent in all the world.

Same as Jack’s Queen of Hearts; you’re so busy watching you don’t ', '.', 'The idea that magic was as simple as swapping forefingers with index fingers made me a lifelong fan of tricks and scams, fakes and fly moves. I begged and begged to get a magic kit of my own for my twelfth birthday, but I learned pretty soon that I didn’t have the motor skills—or the dedication—to work a palm or a drop. There is no performance art rehearsed like magic. Thousands—tens of thousands—of repetitions: Magicians practice a move until it’s automatic, perfect, instant and unseen.', 'I couldn’t learn the guile.', 'In community college I always sat in the same chair.

Marketing, my friend. Is. Everything.” The plan was clear and entire before me. I had a vision. “Battle of the wizards. Gandalf versus Thulsa Doom.”', '“I could be wrong here…” Salazar was a less frequent visitor to the evening sessions than Inés, but he did chip in for the scotch. We were a small, tight community; four trailers drawn in around an open yard in a quiet corner of Buena Vista. We all chipped in what we could, when we could. “But that’s more Gandalf versus the all-seeing eye of Sauron.”', '“The point,” I said, “the actual point is: You market it, you make it the biggest magic show in Reno—bigger even than anything in Las Vegas. The biggest show in the world. I tell you, you’ll get every magician and table-worker and illusionist and mentalist on five continents turning up to see this. It’s the classic battle—man versus machine. Like that chess master taking on Big Blue, or whatever.”', '“Deep Blue,” Salazar said. Know your enemy.', '“That chess master lost,” Jack said.', '“Your career’s finished anyway,” Salazar said. “Like mine. Another robot kill. If you stop talking to Remi on the phone, it’ll break in on the sound system. If you shut down the sound system, it’ll just post the camera feed on YouTube. This way, you keep a percentage of the house and the licensing deal and a story for the after-dinner and convention circuit.”', '“You’ve got this all thought out,” Jack said, and I knew I had him.', '“Looking at ways to game the system is my job,” Salazar said. “Was.”', '“Wizard Wars!” I said. “Or Wizard versus Wizard. Which sounds better?”', 'Then came a cry from Inés’s trailer and a sudden, flickering light. She had knocked over one of her candle stubs. Her curtains were on fire. Salazar pulled open the door, I went through like a linebacker and hauled Inés out. Her hair was singed, her hands scorched. Her sofa was ablaze. Black smoke boiled up from the burning upholstery foam. Then Maltese Jack was in with the fire extinguisher, sending tornadoes of powder to every corner of the trailer. The fire was out in moments. Powder covered every surface. The trailer leaked smoke from door, windows, every vent. It would be weeks before Inés could live there again, if ever.', '“You stay with me tonight,” I said. Pernell Brolin, refuge to the lost.', 'We knew then we had to get out of Buena Vista.', '\\xa0', 'The management didn’t go for either Wizard Wars or Wizard vs Wizard. They had their marketing department take a look at our proposal and decided to call it Magic or Machine? Like a Discovery Channel show.', 'Which is to say, they bought into it two hundred percent. A thousand percent. They bought it. The dudes who developed the software bought it. The papers, the syndication shows, the networks, and the digital channels: They bought it. The other casinos in Reno bought it: They wanted to see if Remi was as good as the Silverado said it was. And the public bought it.', 'Maltese Jack’s agent negotiated him a percentage of house and rights. It was a sweet deal. The Silverado added a rider; every trick that Remi guessed, Jack would never perform again. We both read the score: a Las Vegas magician on the glide-path of his career, who couldn’t even fill the smallest bar in the resort. It was the mother of all resignation letters.', 'So, you’ve had the meet-cute. Now the montage.', 'We had a date: Halloween. Of course. We had a venue, the Gold Room: the Silverado’s four-thousand-seater prime ballroom. Full light, sound, and projection. Willie Nelson filled it ten years back, ten nights in a row. Jack Caruana had one night, and he could have filled it ten times over.', 'Maltese Jack’s problem: There are only ten magic effects. Vanish, produce, transform, restore. Transpose, transport, escape. Levitation, penetration, prediction. Everything else is panache. Remi knew all ten.', 'Maltese Jack’s problem: part two. The kind of magic he performed was small scale, close up, unshowy. Making it fill the Gold Room was an issue. Big flashy displays, glam assistants in fishnets and smiles, would make the audience suspicious and kill it dead. Possible solution…', 'Add celebrities. The guest list for the golden circle was so full the Silverado had to start star-rating the celebs. Fellow magicians—only if they’d had a network series, a residency of more than six months, or seven million YouTube hits. Movie stars—only if promoting something that would be premiering at the time of the show. Sports stars. Supermodels. Millionaires, no chance, billionaires: step right up. Bloggers, vloggers. Influencers. Musicians? We could have filled the Gold Room with needy pop stars and had them spilling onto the gaming floor. Celebrities had the panache. Pick a star, pull them up onstage, and stick a camera in the face to see the OMG! expression all over the screens. Who needed flash and fishnets?', 'The publicity grind. The media training, the interviews, the photo shoots and profiles. The Silverado moved Jack out of Buena Vista to a penthouse suite. Inés took over his trailer. Management still hadn’t gotten round to fixing the fire damage. When our shifts allowed, Jack invited us up to abuse the bar.', '“Look at the size of the bathroom,” Salazar said. “You could fight a war in here.”', '“Egyptian cotton,” Inés said, stroking the sheets. Her hands had healed after the fire but the pain had set into the nerves and would likely never leave again. “What’s the thread count?”', '“You can see all the mountains,” I said. I was out on the balcony. Cooler now, a different season.', '“Planes coming in,” Salazar said, joining me.', '“Where are our trailers?” Inés asked. From the penthouse level we could see Buena Vista at the center of a ring of casinos.', '“It’s like a walled garden,” Salazar said.', '“Some fuckin’ garden,” I said.', '“Way to the right,” Jack said. “You can’t see them. The trees get in the way.”', 'It was pleasant on the penthouse balcony, with hundred-dollar bourbon and a cooling breeze from Tahoe, and it all said, ', ' Because if he did, he sure wasn’t telling me.', '\\xa0', 'On the night, he called it right. The Silverado wanted tux minimum; silver lamé preferred. Maltese Jack walked on in the same slightly tight, cheap gray suit he wore for all his shows. At least a hat, the dresser said.', '“Hats are for Sinatra,” Jack said.', 'So on he came, a small man in his early sixties in a bad suit. Onto the biggest stage of his life. He was on his mark before the follow-spot found him; it was another twenty seconds before the audience realized who he was. We started the applause. He had reserved us a table. Not the best, not in the golden circle, too close to the bar and we had to share it with a team from Boing Boing. He waited for the applause to die down.', '“Good evening. I’m Jack Caruana. And I’d now like to introduce my partner and worst enemy, the machine that will decide in front of this specially invited audience and all these cameras if there really is such a thing as magic. Remi, the house AI.”', 'Remi’s voice boomed from the sound system. “Good evening, Jack. Good evening, guests and everyone watching on television,” and oh my days, the Gold Room went apeshit. Jack went down to a table in the golden circle and an actress I kind of recognized from those car-stunt movies gave him a big black book.', '“My book of tricks,” Jack said. He put it on an honest-to-God church lectern. “My grimoire.”', ': that’s a good, mouth-filling word. Thulsa Doom would sure as shit have a ', '.', 'He led with an old one, an easy one; a gussied-up variation on that same force that Remi had spotted and called us on Jack’s cell to discuss. Even I could see how it was done. Brian Hoyer from the Patriots, who’d come up waving and smiling to pick the card, was stunned. The room went silent as a morgue, waiting to see what Remi made of it.', '“I am disappointed, Jack,” Remi said. “Very disappointed. Really, the bottom card force? That was the very first trick I learned.” Whoever was on the sound desk managed to make him sound even more irritating and petulant than he was on the phone. Remi spent five minutes taking Jack’s effect apart to the last finger-flick and thumb-hold. The entire Gold Room was spellbound. Jack Caruana stood smiling.', '“That your last word Remi?”', '“It is, Jack.”', '“Well, Remi, our deal is, if you can see how the trick is done, the trick is gone. You saw it. That trick is gone. Dead. Buried.” And Jack strode over to the grimoire, tore out a page, and held it up for all to see. A flick of the fingers, a flash of blue fire, and the page was floating ash. ', 's. Flash-paper; always a nice piece of theater.', 'Next Jack brought one of those new country and western singers onstage. A decent prediction effect, a bit of number magic. Applause. Camera close-ups of amazed faces at the celeb tables. The pause—the AI equivalent of clearing your throat. Then Remi explained how he had done it in such detail, the whole Gold Room could have gone home and performed it.', 'Jack went to the grimoire; another spell from his book of tricks went up in a blue flash.', 'The French Drop. The Blackstone Cardless Card Trick. The Talkative Clipboard. Twisting the Aces. Classic effects, all of them. And Remi destroyed all of them in that patient, geeky, reasonable voice. Each dead trick, a page went up in blue fire from the book of magic. At first the audience had laughed and applauded when Remi told them how the effect was done. Then I noticed them sit back and sigh and murmur, and those murmurs become rumbles of displeasure. Because Jack was losing to Remi, but Remi was losing the audience. Remi didn’t know, didn’t care. Remi didn’t see the panache. Remi only saw the guile. And that was its mistake.', 'Hummer Card, Mexican Turnover, Scotch and Soda, the Reluctant Telepath. Dead, dead, dead. Dead. I felt the Gold Room turn, I felt the anger and silent resentment, from every pit-watcher who lost his job to an AI to the singer who’d been auto-tuned until every atom of individuality had been polished out of her voice, every musician who’d had an AI take her song, drop it around beats and boops and turn it into some shiny, soulless global megahit. Every ball-player and tennis star and golfer who’d had their game taken apart and analyzed and drilled by a machine coach again and again and again to do it right do it right do it right. And I saw that the real loser was Remi.', 'Jack went to the grimoire, opened it to let the final page hang down.', '“All gone,” he said. “Every trick in the book. Except one.”', 'Every magician keeps the big effect for the finale. Leave them astounded. The Gold Room went quiet. Even the bar fell silent. Not a camera-whir, not a notification alert. Jack went down into the golden circle and led Taylor Swift up onto the stage.', 'Everyone in the Gold Room was on the edge of their seat.', 'Jack delivered some quick-fire patter, let Taylor promote the new album, then said, “I’m going to show you a deck of cards.” He took a deck out of his right pocket.', 'I whispered, ', '.', 'He did the force and the switch, right pocket–left pocket. The worst, the best, the most bare-faced trick in the world. Queen of Hearts. They’re all Queens of Hearts. A silence in the Gold Room. Was that it? Was that the trick that Remi couldn’t solve? Applause started—not by me—broke into a ripple, into a cautious wave. Obviously something very, very clever had happened here. Something Muggles couldn’t see, something not even Remi could see.', '“Jack.” The Gold Room held its collective breath. Cameras went in close on Jack Caruana’s face. “Jack. You took the first deck from your right pocket. You took the second from your left pocket.”', 'The Gold Room exhaled. They hadn’t seen it. They truly had not seen it, the most blatant, most stupid, most obvious trick in the grimoire. In that instant, they hated Remi. He had shown them something obvious, right in front of their eyes, that they hadn’t noticed. Any kid could do that trick. It had fooled four thousand people, live in front of cameras. Remi had just told every celeb and sports star and the guys from Boing Boing that they were blind and stupid.', 'Jack ripped the final page from the grimoire and held it up. A click of the fingers and it was consumed in blue fire.', '“Ladies and gentleman, the machine has won. It was a privilege to perform for you the night the magic died.”', 'Then he walked down from the stage and up between the tables toward the ballroom’s main doors. The Gold Room rose around him. Roaring, cheering. Whistling and yelling and whooping. Because no one wants the magic to die. No one wants to know how the trick is done. We want wonder in the world, things we can’t explain. We want to be fooled, even though we know there is no such thing as magic. It’s always a trick. It’s the quality of the trick—the guile— that matters.', 'Jack Caruana walked through those tables and out the double golden doors, clean out of the Silverado, and never once looked back. A beaten man, triumphant.', 'And that’s the panache.', '\\xa0', 'We waited until the celebs and the movie stars and vloggers had all gone, until the TV crews were coiling their cables and de-rigging their microphones. Salazar and Inés and me, we went to the elite pickup zone and waited on the red carpet between the golden ropes. Perfectly on cue, the executive van with the blacked-out windows pulled in.', 'Jack already had the champagne open.', '“Airport, sir?” the driver said. Adnan had booked the executive van two months before.', '“How much time have we got?” Jack asked.', '“Time for whatever you want,” Adnan said.', '“Take us the tourist route,” Jack said. We went round Buena Vista, all the way, three times, drinking the champagne as we wove between the shuttle buses. Then Adnan drove us downtown through the neon and we drank the second bottle of champagne in the blue-green flickering light.', '“I thought I was going to shit myself when you did that dumb-ass two-pocket force,” I said.', '“Run the risk of a new trick that just might work?” Jack said. “The pocket switch was a sure bet.”', 'There is a proverb in magic: Make the audience walk as far as possible from the trick to the effect. In the best effects, the guile happens even before the magician has told you what the trick is about. If the vigorish gets you in the end, the wise bet is on the house. We played Remi to lose. If Jack had beaten the AI he would have been locked up in the Silverado forever, performing that one trick again and again and again. Hey! Give us the trick that beat the computer! Again and again and again. With every eye in the Gold Room watching his every flick of a finger to spot the guile that the computer missed.', 'We made it out clean and there was a plane on approach high over the desert, coming to take us down to Florida.', 'Fly away Peter, fly away Paul. Fly away Inés and Salazar and Pernell and Jack.', 'But the best tricks—the very best tricks—have the twist in the end. The kind of trick where you borrow someone’s tie and cut it into pieces, then forget about while you do the real trick and then at the very end, when tie-guy is the only one remembers what you did, you bring it back whole again.', '“How much did you take them for?” Jack asked as Adnan brought bags round to the curb.', '“About a grand,” Adnan said.', 'Remi boasted that it did not see as humans saw, that it could not be misdirected. But a magician will tell you: They don’t deal in misdirection. They deal in direction.', 'Staff can’t gamble at their own casino. But their friends, relatives, workmates at other place of employment: They can. Remi studied us, but it never occurred to it that we might study it. Learn its tricks and guiles. While Remi was watching Maltese Jack Caruana up there in the spotlight, a hundred gamblers hit the Silverado’s two floors. The casino was packed that night, players watching the Wizard Wars as they fed the machines. Our foot soldiers worked the tables, made money, moved on. Made money, moved on. Made money, cashed up, and rolled on out. The bank of Buena Vista. Remi never saw, because Remi was watching Jack.', 'And ', ' the guile.', '\\xa0', 'And that’s the story of how Maltese Jack Caruana beat the machine.', 'What ya mean, you didn’t see it?

Any of those will get you there.', 'Anyway, thanks for the drink. Should be heading back. I’ll call an Uber, thanks. It’s pretty close. Yeah, we all have apartments in a gated community. No it’s not fuckin’ Cocoon. I don’t need to be mentalist to know you were going to say that. You all do. It’s nice, a pool, tropical planting. Wi-Fi, gym, store. Golf buggies to get around when we want to visit. No, not a beachfront location; who can afford that? But you can smell the ocean in the morning, and on a quiet night, you can sometimes hear the waves.', 'You see, it’s the things you notice and the things you miss. Did you notice that I never explain why Jack was called Maltese Jack? Nor will I. Just recall what I said about the best tricks having a turn at the end. You see, I called this story “The Guile,” not “The Panache.” And I also said that the smart wizard makes it a long walk from the guile to the panache. The effect.

Not open disappointment, or stoic acceptance, of the sort that people always wore, nor the greedy desperation that meant they would ask for another ticket, and then another, until their money ran out.', 'But neither was it amazement, or shock, or any reaction of the sort he’d have expected were someone to get ', '.

The winner this time was a middle-aged man from Guangzhou, with a comb-over and bottle-top glasses and a nice smile; he had the sort of face that smiled easily, and sometimes ruefully, at the world’s foibles. It was the third card he’d bought and he was chatting to Esham all this while, a running commentary about the day’s weather (it was humid), the cost per unit of elastic hair bands (he had recently found a new manufacturer who could make them a point cheaper, saving him thousands), and his daughter’s new boyfriend (a no-good know-it-all, but what were you going to do? Kids today and all that). Then the silver foil all came off and the man’s face slackened and his lips stopped moving and he rocked in place as though he’d been struck, and Esham said, “Sir? Sir? Are you all right?” and the man just nodded, over and over, and finally gave him a goofy grin.', '“Look,” he said. “Would you look at that.”', 'A car appeared ’round the corner and came to a stop beside Esham’s lottery stall. It was a long black limousine, with darkened windows. The doors opened and two men in dark suits and dark sunglasses stepped out. They both had short cropped hair and were very trim and fit. One held the door of the limousine open. The other said, “Congratulations, sir. Please, come with us.”', '“But where are we going?” the man said.', '“It’s only a short ride to the airport, sir.”', '“The airport?”', '“To get to the Singapore beanstalk, sir. It isn’t a long flight, sir.”', '“Singapore? I have never been to Singapore.”', '“It will only be a short stop, sir. A pod on the beanstalk is already reserved for you. Here, sir. Your ticket.”', '“My ticket?”', '“For your onward journey.”', 'The man stared at the ticket. He looked, almost pleadingly, at Eshamuddin.', '“So it’s really true?” he said. “I won? I won the lottery?”', '“Yes, sir.”', '“I’ve always wanted to see Mars,” the man said. “Olympus Mons and Tong Yun City and the Valles Marineris kibbutzim…”', '“Whatever your true heart’s desire, sir,” the man said. It was the same legend that was etched—in now dusty letters—above Esham’s lottery stall. The same legend that was on every lottery stall, anywhere. That was on every ticket.', 'Whatever your true heart’s desire.', '“But my daughter, my job, I can’t just… elastic hair bands,” he said, desperately.', 'The car waited. Esham waited. The two men in their short cropped hair and smart black suits and ties waited. The man mopped his brow. “I suppose…” he said.', '“Sir?”', 'He meekly let them lead him to the car. He folded into the cool interior and the doors shut and the two men disappeared inside and the car started up and drove away and the man was gone.', 'To Mars, Esham supposed.', '“Mars!” said Mrs Li. She pushed her way to the booth and leered at Esham. “Who in their right mind would want to go to Mars, boy?” She shoved a handful of coins across the counter. “Give me a ticket.”', 'Esham took the money and gave her a ticket. You could count on Mrs Li to buy a few at a time. He wondered what her true heart’s desire was.', '“That’s none of your damn business, boy!” Mrs Li said.', 'She scratched the card with maniacal glee.', '\\xa0', '3.', 'The third time he witnessed a miracle it wasn’t anything like that.', 'It was a foreigner, a trader on a purchasing trip to Yiwu from one of the coastal African states. He was with a couple of colleagues, and he bore an amused smile as he paid for the ticket. It was just something to do, a local custom, something to pass the time, he seemed to suggest. He scratched the card and looked at it with that same tolerant smile, and he began to say, in bad Mandarin, “What does this mean–” when it happened.', 'It was like a curtain swished behind the man. The man half-turned, looked, and there was an expression on his face that Esham couldn’t read. The man reached out one hand and touched the curtain. He prodded it with his fingers. He took a half step, and then another. There was nothing there, and yet there was. He half-turned back and smiled at Esham. Then he stepped through into the whatever-it-was and just… disappeared.', 'His two colleagues did a lot of shouting and Esham did a lot of hand waving and shouting back and finally some of the market police came along and they did a little shouting too and then, after a while, everyone left.', 'Esham stayed, of course. But business was slow and after another hour he closed the stall for the day. It had been a strange one. He wondered where the man went, and what he saw, and whether he was happy there.', 'He ate a bowl of crossing-the-bridge noodles at a Yunnanese stall, then had sweetened mint tea at a Lebanese café near the Zone 7 mosque, and then he walked slowly back. Two blind musicians played the guqin outside Pig Sty Alley, and the air was perfumed with wisteria. The smell was manufactured in the factories of Zone 10, at a very reasonable per unit cost, and consequently sold all across the world.', 'That night, Esham drew the walls of his stall-home down and sat inside. He tuned in to the latest episode of his favourite soap, ', ', which broadcast across the hub network of the Conversation in near space, all the way from Mars. In the air before him, The Beautiful Maharani argued with Johnny Novum inside her domed palace, as ice meteorites fell onto the red sands far in the distance. Esham ate shaved ice with lychee syrup. It had been a strange day, he thought.', '\\xa0', '4.', 'Esham was born in Yiwu but he wasn’t Chinese. Many native-born residents of Yiwu weren’t. His father had been a small-goods trader from the Ecclesiastical Confederacy of Iran, and his mother was an interpreter for a mining company based in the Belt, which purchased mass-market goods for the asteroid longhouses. A space Dayak, she often complained of discomfort in Earth’s gravity, not because she was not used to it but because, unlike on the longhouses, there was simply no ', ' it, even for a time. In the Up and Out, she’d told the young Esham, one could simply kick off into a free-fall zone, where you could fly: where you could be free.', 'He didn’t know what his mother’s true heart’s desire would have been. He remembered them both as loving parents—which is not to say they did not sometimes shout at him, in frustration, or that they did not fight, which they did—but when he thought of them, what he remembered first was love. His father was away a lot, a train man, as they called them, forever riding the rails along the Silk Road, from Yiwu to Tehran. He’d come back bearing gifts for Esham’s mother—saffron and dried apricots, tiny pickled cucumbers, rose water and golpar—and for Esham he’d bring back little hand-made curios, wood and wire intertwined with wildtech components, toys that existed in both the virtual and the real.', 'They died in a simple transport capsule accident on a visit to the underwater cities of Hainan. The new cities were the jewels of the South China Sea, glittering biospheres abundant in offshore aquaculture, home to millions of people who lived and breathed under water. It was just a stupid accident, the sort that never even made the news. He was still only a boy when it happened. After that the state took him in. For a long time he’d had the dream of buying lottery tickets until he’d found a winning one and then the lottery would bring his parents back to life. Even though he knew it was just a dream. Even the lottery could not bring back the dead.', 'The lottery really began as just another roadside tradition, around the time they rebuilt Yiwu from scratch into the lotus flower shape it had now. Each petal a zone, each zone a market to rival all other markets. There was nothing, it was said, that you couldn’t buy in Yiwu. But mostly it was the small stuff, the domestic stuff, still, then and now: key rings and bath mats, mugs and toothbrushes, artificial flowers, ladies’ handbags, raincoats and mascaras, pens and watches, clocks and toys and festive decorations… the factories in the outer zones beyond the city never slept, the market traders in their petal-sections of the market-city only ever slept in shifts, and the trains never stopped coming and going with the giant containers on their backs.', 'The first lottery was on the same scale. It really was just a community sort of thing. People coming together to make your life a little easier, a little better. When people would get together and buy tickets and each would win something they needed—help with repairs on their house, or delivery assistance for groceries, or someone to bring you food while you were sick, if you didn’t have family to care for you.', 'At least, that was the story.', 'On how the lottery really came to be, there were as many stories as there were fish in the fish market or toys in the toy market or pens in the pen stalls or fake snow in the Christmas pavilion. They said the lottery used Shenzhen ghost market tech and was overseen by the Others, those mysterious digital intelligences that first evolved in Jerusalem’s Breeding Grounds and now lived in impenetrable Cores guarded over by the mercenaries of Clan Ayodhya. Others said it was run by the Kunming Toads under Boss Gui, whose labs in the Golden Triangle churned out verboten technology and traded in illicit info-weapons and employed Strigoi assassins for all that they were banned on Earth. Others still said it was wild hagiratech from Jettisoned, that farthest outpost of humanity on the moon called Charon, from where the sun appeared as little more than a baleful raven’s eye in the sky, and that the lottery was run from off-world, and you know what people in the Up and Out were like.', 'Esham didn’t know. He didn’t even think to ask. The lottery just was, and it gave a few people every year something impossible and precious: their true heart’s desire. And it gave him, Esham, a job.', '\\xa0', '5.', 'Every morning he sat up in his cot and brushed his teeth in the sink and washed his face and his armpits and he drank a cup of tea. Then he unfolded the walls of the lottery booth and prepared to welcome the day. If the previous day’s take was good, he might walk to a nearby stall for a bowl of congee. If the take was not good, he would usually forego breakfast. His accommodation was free and his needs were few, and only the rich, as the old proverb goes, have time to dream. But that’s what the lottery was for, he thought. For the poor to have dreams.', 'From time to time he would move the lottery stall around the city. There were many lottery stalls but they all travelled if they needed to. Currently he was stationed in Zone 7, where the automata market was. Every late afternoon he’d shut the booth for an hour or so and take a stroll. The petal of Zone 7 rose high into the air above the central pistil. From up here you could look all over the city, to the zone-petals and their markets heaving with humanity and goods, and to the mountains that ranged Yiwu, and to the outer zones where the workers lived in the vast container shanties and grew their hydroponics food in green growtainers, and then beyond to the ring of factories. The petals were designed to catch wind and sun and rain, to reuse everything, to draw power from the elements. If the previous day’s take was good he might buy himself a modest lunch of some sort: Vietnamese banh mi or pho, or an Egyptian falafel or a bowl of noodles. If the take was good he might go to the public baths to wash. While the city operated on a range of digital currencies in the Conversation, the lottery only ever accepted coins. Why that was he didn’t know. They did not mind the type of currency, so each day Esham would sort out the day’s take by type and place of origin: Martian shekels and rubles alongside Belt-issued ringgit, local yuan, Micronesian dollars, lunar vatu… the list went on and on. Each evening he would pack the coins and place them in the appropriate bin provided, and each morning they would be gone.', 'Esham had his regulars. Mrs Li, who owned a factory that made snow globes, visited him every day. Mr Mansur, who came each year to Yiwu to buy lights, so many lights that he shipped to his distant home, would visit avidly when he was in town. He could always be relied upon to buy the extra ticket, and his face always bore a hopeful, yet simultaneously sad, look. He was a quiet, courteous man. There were others. They came and went like the tides.', 'In the afternoon a troupe of Martian Re-Born walked past, red-skinned, four-armed, laughing, wearing lanyards with laminated cards on their chests. They were of an Up and Out order which believed in an ancient Martian civilization ruled over by an Emperor of Time, and they modified their bodies to match their imagined perspective of that long vanished warrior race. They stopped, curious, at his stall and each bought one ticket, and they paid with coins that bore the profile of a P’rin, those imaginary reptilian birds that the Re-Born believed were the time-travelling messengers of their Emperor. None of them won.', 'A street cleaning machine crept past along the road, humming cheerfully to itself. Trams whooshed overhead on their graceful spirals, moving between the zones. The air smelled of hot leather, shoe polish, fried garlic, knockoff Chanel No. 5 perfume, uncollected garbage, frangipani and the recycled air blown out of a thousand air conditioners. It was then that he saw her, emerging from the market doors out into the hot street beyond.', 'The woman was no taller than Esham, but she moved with a quiet purpose that he envied: a sense of completeness, a comfort in one’s own skin he had never possessed. Esham was the sort of person who skulked through life, careful to avoid any potential for trouble. He had few friends and fewer vices and he never played the lottery.', 'The woman crossed the road and came to his stall and stopped. The laminated card attached to her lanyard said her name was Ms Qiu.', '“Hello,” she said. The smile she offered him would have broken his heart had he opened his heart to it.', '“Hello,” he said.', 'She had just an ordinary face, the sort you would easily lose in a crowd. Her hair was cut in a fashionable style that was nevertheless a year or so behind whatever the current trend was in Shanghai that spring. Her hand rested on the counter, lightly. Her fingers tapped on the surface. He looked away from her.', '“May I have a card?” she said.', '“Of course.”', 'She smiled when he gave it to her. She scratched it with an old 50-mongo coin. She looked at it, almost puzzled, then shrugged and left it on the counter.', '“Thank you,” she said.', '“You’re welcome.”', 'He watched her walk away.', '\\xa0', '6.', 'This became a daily routine. He came to await the moment when Ms Qiu appeared out of the market entrance. He’d watch her cross the road. He’d always wait. She’d say, “Hello.” He’d say, “Hello.” She’d ask for a card, and he would pass one to her, and she’d pay him with whatever coins she happened to carry that day—rubles, dinars, one time with a gold sovereign. Then she’d frown, shrug, give him a final smile or say, “Goodbye,” quietly, and walk away.', 'Sometimes, on his break, he would search for her in the market. He’d pass the rows of artificial cockatoos and peacocks, and the little singing birds in their cages with their bright glass eyes, and the enclosure of the animatronics tigers and the dodo arcade, but only once he thought he saw her, at a distance, speaking to a man in a navy-blue suit, but he could not be sure and, when he came closer, she was gone, if it had been her at all.', 'He took to eating his lunch at a Melanesian stall serving sup blong buluk wetem raes, simple, filling fare, and cheaply priced, a place popular with many of the Pacific traders.

Of course.”', '“I’ve seen you around,” she said. “So you went with the lottery.”', '“I did. You?”', '“Well, you can see.”', '“Artificial gall bladders.”', '“I have my own place now,” she said. “It’s in container town but I’m there alone, no one else.”', 'He knew what she meant.

There was something wrong, in hindsight, with the whole day, some intimation of disaster one could trace in the slight rise in air pressure or in the swoosh of the trams overhead, or in the clinking of coinage. Mrs Li came and bought three tickets, and left with a huff. Mr Mansur came by and bought one, and stopped to chat for a little while before he, too, left. A couple of monks went past and did not buy tickets. A bulk buyer from the Martian Soviet came and got a ticket and then a trader from Harbin.', 'It was just an ordinary day, the way Esham liked it. Order and routine, a knowing of what was expected. At the usual time, Ms Qiu emerged from the market doors. She crossed the road.

In many ways it could have been the quintessential Yiwu market floor, small scale manufacturing, large scale distribution, only here they didn’t sell bath mats or doorknobs, they sold miracles.', 'He wondered what they did with all the coins.', '“Only, how long will it be?” he said. “This is very important.”', '“Please wait.

Night fell and the air had a wild, festive feel to it, but mixed with a sense of unpredictability. People lit torches and drank beer and baiju. Fights broke out. People kept shouting questions at him. He couldn’t leave. Then a group of young men set on him. They demanded to see the ticket. He tried to shut the booth but they started pushing it, rocking it from side to side. Esham tried to slip out and someone pushed him, and he fell. The mood turned ugly. He looked up and saw their faces, lit and hungry. He curled up into a ball. He’d been kicked before, the key was to try and minimise the damage.', 'They started landing blows. Fists, feet. Then someone shouted, “Leave him alone!”', 'It was Isa, from the market. She came in, fearless, and stood over him and faced down the bullies.', '“Go away,” she told them.', 'Which, remarkably, they did.', 'She helped him to his feet.', '“Are you all right?”', 'He tried to smile, though it hurt.', '“Here,” she said. “You’re bleeding.” She sat him down on a bench and cleaned the cut in his face. His ribs hurt from the kicking. The city shone overhead in a million lights.', '“Thanks, Isa.”', '“We’ve got to look after each other,” she said. “Or who else will?”', 'He nodded. He felt very tired.', 'They sat together on the warm bench under the petal zones of the city, side by side, in companionable silence.', '\\xa0', '9.', '“I must speak to the Area Controller,” Esham said. It had taken him hours to find the lottery regional office. It really was just a door, tucked in the back of Zone 2, and he’d had to pass through miles of near-identical corridors, through stalls which sold miniature models of folding Beijings, fish from Lijiang and flowers from Shazui, Perky Pat dolls bound for Mars and replica guns from Isher, anti-spiritual pollution spray in aluminum cans, Samsara wheels that played a song as they were spun and little self-assembly spacecraft models from General Products—a sea of kipple, an endless, rolling expanse, heap upon heap of old stuff someone, somewhere, simply couldn’t let go of.', 'He went past it. He found the door. It was just a door.', '“I must speak to the Area Controller,” he said.', 'The door seemed to hesitate.', '“This is most irregular,” it said.', '“The situation is most irregular!” Esham said, with more force than he meant to.', '“I’m sorry,” he said.', '“Don’t mention it,” said the door.', '“Can I come through?”', 'The door hesitated.', '“We’re very busy right now,” it said.', '“This is important!”', '“I am sure,” the door said, in a maddeningly reasonable voice, “that is seems very important to you.” It sighed. “I wasn’t always a door, you know,” it said. “I used to be a poet.” It reflected for a while. “Still. I like being a door. Sometimes you’re open. Sometimes you’re closed. There’s very little in between. I find that comforting. Don’t you?”', '“Me?”', '“Well, you’re not a door,” the door said. “So I suppose you wouldn’t understand.”', 'It seemed to reflect again.', '“Oh, well,” it said at last. “But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”', 'The door irised open.', 'Esham stepped through.', '\\xa0', '10.', 'The corridor felt like an access tube strung over some enormous height. The accordion walls contracted and expanded and the whole passage seemed to move as though buffeted by unseen wind. He stumbled along it, holding on to the walls to stay upright. Lights flashed overhead. A mechanical voice kept counting, “Eight billion point two four five, eight billion point two four seven, eight billion point two five one,” incomprehensively. Esham came to the end of the corridor. He stepped through…', 'For a moment he had the sense of galactic space all around him. He saw a planet adorned with rings, and fireflies in formation all around it, and the sun far against the endless dark, a lone yellow star. Then it vanished and the voice stopped the count and a new voice said, “Welcome to Lottery sub-level 15, vendor human type Eshamuddin. Area Controller Dee will be with you shortly.”', 'He looked around him, at this ordinary floor. It could have been any market level in Yiwu. Though he was suddenly certain he was nowhere near Yiwu. Not even on Earth, maybe. There were windows in the far walls. He could see a night sky, but not much else. Height, though. He was high up, in a skyscraper, somewhere foreign. He was almost sure. He began to walk to the windows. If only he could see…', '“Sir? Come with me, please.”', '\\xa0', '11.', 'Area Controller Dee was a short, fat man in a chequered shirt with one button too many undone and thinning black hair that stuck to his forehead. He mopped his face and pushed the basket of food on his desk towards Esham.', '“Prawns?”', 'Grease shone on his fingers. Esham shook his head.', '“No. Thank you.”', '“Suit yourself.”', 'Dee ate fast. When he finished he let out a satisfied burp and wiped his fingers clean on a dirty napkin.', '“So,” he said. “What is all this about?”', '“Sir,” Esham said. “Do you mind if I ask where we are?”', '“The lottery building,” Area Controller Dee said.', '“But where, I mean what–”', '“The lottery is the lottery,” Area Controller Dee said. “Yes?”', '“Yes, sir.”', '“Now, could you get to the point? I don’t have all day.”', '“It’s about this ticket, sir. It’s a winning ticket, sir.”', '“A winning ticket? Let me see.”', 'Dee took the scratch card from him. He looked at it and pursed his lips. His eyes glazed, for a moment, as he accessed his node.', '“Ah, yes,” he said. “Defunct.”', '“Defunct, sir?”', '“It was an error,” Dee said. “Don’t worry about it.”', '“So it didn’t work? But Ms Qiu–”', '“Ms Qiu?” Dee said.', '“The woman who purchased it, sir.”', '“Not human,” Dee said.', '“Not human, sir?”', '“Automaton. Replica. Animatroni– well, you know.” He waved his hand. “Ex-display.”', '“Ex-display?”', '“Do you just repeat everything anyone ever says to you?” Dee said.', '“Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir. Sir, what do we do here? What is the lottery for?”', 'Area Controller Dee unwrapped a lollypop and stuck it in his mouth. He sucked on it noisily then took it out with a pop.', '“The lottery’s the lottery,” he said, with an air of satisfied finality.', '\\xa0', '12.', 'Arrows led him back the way he’d come across the floor. Far in the distance he saw an old mechanical slat board that kept clacking, with figures that kept changing for Mars, Lunar Port, Titan, Ganymede, Io, Calisto, Jettisoned, Ceres, Vesta, Calypso, Hyperion, Nix and Hydra. And Earth, of course. The same mechanical voice returned, “eight billion point two six eight, eight billion point two seven one,” droning on. Esham came to a door. He opened it, and stepped out onto a street in Yiwu.', 'It was late afternoon. The sun was low against the mountains. The petals of the market zones rose in the sky, casting shadows over the surface streets. He was in a quiet residential neighbourhood not far from Zone 7. As he stood there, he saw Ms Qiu cross the street. She walked in that same assured, unhurried pace. She didn’t see him. She came to a small house with a well-tended front garden and a little white fence. Two children came running out to greet her, and Esham thought he saw the outline of a man waiting at the door. Ms Qiu went in with the children.', 'Esham came a little closer. He peeked through the windows, which were open to let in the breeze. He saw them sit down at the dinner table, the children talking animatedly, Ms Qiu smiling quietly. The man said something and she laughed.', 'Esham left them to have their privacy. He walked back to his stall, and saw that Isa was there, waiting for him.', '“I thought I’d take you out to dinner,” she said.', '“I’d like that,” Esham said.', '“What shall we have?” she said. She laughed. “Whatever is your true heart’s desire.”', 'So they shared crossing-the-bridge noodles at the Yunnanese stall, and then they had sweetened mint tea at the Lebanese café.', 'And then, together, they went home.', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Lavie Tidhar', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Feifei Ruan']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Black Friday'], 'Author': ['Alex Irvine'], 'Body': ['In a dark future America where consumerism and gun culture are unchecked, a young family teams up to celebrate the first shopping day of the Christmas season in the most patriotic way possible.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The Mugs crack the Greenleaf Crossing Galleria’s perimeter security through a fire door off the parking garage sub-basement at 11:56. On the landing, protected from potential incoming fire by the zigzagging stairwell, Caleb Anderson gets out the turkey sandwich. He takes a bite, getting a little cranberry sauce on his thumb, then passes it to the children, oldest to youngest: Brian, JJ, Lucy. Fifteen, fourteen, and Lucy, his Black Friday girl, is about an hour away from turning twelve. Each takes one bite. Tradition. Caleb checks his watch. Eleven fifty-eight. Go time. Anything they get before midnight they’ll have to give back. Anything they weren’t already trying to get by maybe 12:05, well, things would get complicated.', '“Happy Thanksgiving, Mugs,” he says. Caleb is a traditionalist. He’s always liked Thanksgiving. “Now let’s get moving.”', 'In formation, they head up the stairwell: Caleb on point and Brian bringing up the rear. The kids wrote out their lists the day before and argued about what they should hit first. Things degenerated to the point where Caleb had decided to step in and set their mission parameters himself by flipping a coin. Both boys wanted to hit Central Sports for new skates and limited-edition Black Friday Bruins jerseys. Lucy held out for Circuit Shack and a new gaming console bundled with a VR headset and a year’s free DLC of her favorite game, ', '. The coin came up tails, Lucy won, and as far as Caleb was concerned that was the end of it.', 'The fire door leading to the mall’s second floor is still closed and taped. The cameras would see that the Mugs were the first team through. Viewing audiences with their faces stuffed full of turkey were placing bets. The Mugs were one of sixteen teams that had won the lottery to celebrate Black Friday at the Galleria. They were on TV, and there was prize money out there for the teams that hit their objectives the quickest. Lots of secondary prizes, too: fewest casualties, most loot caches cracked, that kind of thing. Some of the teams were sponsored but Caleb didn’t want to take any money. Every year he turned down millions in sponsorships from people trying to profit off what had happened to Sarah. The Mugs were out only for themselves. They wanted to celebrate the holiday the way it was supposed to be celebrated, without the compromises sponsorship would bring. So that meant they paid for all their own weapons and training, but Caleb liked it that way. It brought the family together.', '“Gear and weapons check,” Caleb says. The boys are carrying FN SCAR assault rifles chambered for 7.62. Lucy has a pink Bushmaster carbine because she likes pink, and for the .223 round’s lighter recoil. Caleb’s cradling a trusty Mossberg 500 with red-dot optics and a side saddle holding six extra shells in addition to the five on the rear saddle. Just like the one his great-grandfather carried in Vietnam. He’s sentimental. He and the boys are also carrying Beretta 92FS sidearms. They kick a little too much for Lucy, whose secondary weapon is a Glock 42. Everybody checks their loads. It’s 11:59.', 'He hands out lollipops. One, the kids like them. Two, it keeps them from talking as much. Three, it differentiates them from other teams. Friendly fire is an issue sometimes near the entry points to the stores with the most coveted exclusives. “For Mom,” Caleb says. The kids all repeat it around the lollipop sticks in the corners of their mouths. They feel her presence for a moment, as if twelve years later her spirit still lingers here.', 'Then the Mugs crack the tape on the fire door and enter the second floor of the Galleria.', '\\xa0', 'He’s chosen this point of entry for a couple of reasons. Most of the camera feeds are set up at the main entrances to the anchor stores, where teams can get some TV time before they go in. The networks like the stories. Caleb doesn’t want to be a story. Also, because most teams hit the outside doors first, going up through a fire door lessens the chance of an engagement before the Mugs can hit their first objective. If there’s going to be shooting, the Mugs won’t back down from it; on the other hand, he’s got his kids to think of. They don’t have their mother anymore.', 'He leads the way out past vending machines and a stroller rental kiosk. The Galleria is laid out in a long rectangle with six anchor stores spoked out from the ends, two on one side and four on the other. The second floor is a wraparound balcony looking out over the fountains and play areas and knickknack booths in the ground-level concourse. There’s already shooting down there. A drone hovers near the second floor’s glass ceiling, and another one is scooting in the Mugs’ direction. Probably there are fixed cameras in the fake plants and around doorways, too. The Celebration is must-see TV, a festive patriotic commemoration and a sporting event and a holiday all wrapped in one—and the Mugs are always a story. Caleb hates being a story. There’s one commentator in particular, Lyle Odenkirk, who won’t leave it alone. He does color for MSNBCNN, which has been airing Black Friday pre-game since the end of the Tracy’s parade. Every year they tell Sarah’s story, and Lucy’s: the tragic origins of the first Celebration. Caleb keeps an earbud tuned to the commentary even though it makes him want to gouge Odenkirk’s eyes out. It’s within the rules as long as he keeps it to the audio feed. Nobody is supposed to piggyback the video from the drones.', 'Now that the networks know where the Mugs are, so will the other teams. It’s time to hit their first objective before someone comes gunning for them.', 'But just as Caleb has that thought, an intense firefight breaks out on the second floor of Circuit Shack. No way is he walking into that. Better to let the teams involved sort it out and then move in after they’ve gone on to the next items on their list. Lucy has her phone out, checking the Celebration Team Live Status app while both drones veer toward the battle. One of the conditions of entry into the Celebration is that all teams fill out a list of their target items so the broadcast teams can do horse-race commentary. The fight in Circuit Shack is over quickly and there are still three MindCast console bundles in the store inventory. The two engaged teams were the Shopaholics and the Turkey Legs, teams 4 and 8 respectively. Both are apparently still active but with reduced manpower.', 'The Mugs are team 7. Odenkirk talks about them more than he should because of their history. The way he adores Lucy really chafes Caleb, but there’s nothing he can do about it.', '“Change of plans, Mugs,” he says. “We’re going to skirt the balcony to the left, hit Central Sports first. Circuit Shack’s going to be hot for a while.” The more predatory teams would be hunting for the wounded, aiming to finish them off under the pretext of checking items off their lists. This is known as vulturing. It’s one of the things Caleb doesn’t like about the Celebration, but the Mugs can take advantage. Hit ’em where they ain’t.', '“No fair,” Lucy complains. “I won the toss.”', '“I know, sweetheart,” Caleb says. “But nobody’s gotten one of the consoles, right?”', '“Not yet.” She’s sulking.', '“No plan survives contact with the enemy,” JJ says. “Right, Dad?”', '“By the time we crash Central Sports and get back out, Circuit Shack will be quiet again.” Caleb’s still paying attention to Lucy. “Remember, we have to adapt.”', 'She doesn’t answer, but she does put her phone away. In formation, the Mugs swing around the western end of the mall, passing the upstairs entrances to Hudson’s and Tracy’s. Nothing they want in there. Circuit Shack is in the southeast corner, Central Sports the northeast. Between them are Model 21 and AC Rennie. Plenty of room to give the hot zone a wide berth.', 'At least that’s what Caleb is thinking as they make the turn east.', '\\xa0', 'The first group they engage is clearly way over their heads. That happens sometimes, when teams form in areas that don’t have big malls and just have to keep entering lotteries all over the country until they get blessed to enter the Celebration. The feed in Caleb’s ear identifies this team as number 9, a quintet called the Pecan Sandies out of Aroostook County, Maine. Closest mall is in Bangor, and it’s maybe one-fifth the size of the Greenleaf. Also, the Sandies haven’t had a chance to get the sightlines and cover in this mall down, whereas Caleb and his brood have been running drills in the Greenleaf for four years. The Sandies have made an elementary error by using the elevator. There’s no better kill zone in a shopping mall. The doors open, bang. Team Mug takes them down in fifteen seconds flat, from initial contact to cease-fire. The elevator doors close again and the car carries the remains of the Pecan Sandies back downstairs. Mueller and Odenkirk praise their efficiency.', 'But their exchange has drawn attention, possibly from some other more established teams that qualified out of regional tournaments in bigger malls like South Coast Plaza or the Houston Galleria. The Mugs withdraw to a safe and defensible position down a hallway spur that leads to bathrooms and a maintenance room. “Anyone have to take a leak?” JJ cracks. It’s 12:02. Eighty yards of mall concourse yawn between them and the front entrance to Central Sports. They can see it from their position, but they can’t see who else might be looking.', 'Caleb is keeping an eye on Lucy. The Pecan Sandies were her first live fire engagement and her first kill. You never know how someone will handle that. But she’s fine, not shaky or too stone-faced. Either would be cause for concern. She’s locked-in, on mission, still sucking on her lollipop. Must be just about down to the stick by now. The Mugs have always gnawed the sticks. Tradition. He sees that Brian is a little sweaty. “Stay cool, Bri,” he says. This is Brian’s third Celebration. Usually he’s steady. Caleb figures he’ll smooth out now that the first shooting is out of the way.', 'The first time they did the Celebration, the Mugs didn’t go for the big prizes. They got in, tagged a few things, got out. Timid. Testing the waters. Even now they’re not going for the most expensive stuff. Caleb doesn’t mind defending his family, but too many of the Celebration teams have started acting like the real point of it is the shootouts instead of the holiday specials. Lyle Odenkirk is a cheerleader for bloodshed, and his ratings suggest many Americans feel the same. To Caleb this borders on blasphemy, a legacy perversion from the days when open-carry groups started patrolling the malls. To him, the guns were never the point. It was about family. Still is.', '\\xa0', 'He doesn’t want to wait more than sixty seconds for the vultures to come and go. Shooting starts up again on both floors of Tracy’s. That’s at least four teams, Caleb thinks. Lyle Odenkirk is calling out bodies hitting the floor while Frank Mueller calmly ticks off goals achieved. He’s also talking about the big loot caches, left as incentives to keep teams from just grabbing their specified loot and getting out. There’s more drama if teams are competing for the same items. Nobody’s found any of the loot caches yet.', 'Sixty seconds are up. The Mugs hopscotch from kiosk to planter to bench until they have a clear field of fire covering the entrance to Central Sports. On a signal from Caleb, Lucy breaks cover and sprints into the store. She gets in, pulls the tickets for two pairs of skates and two jerseys, and gets back out in thirty seconds. Along the way she has the presence of mind to notice when someone from another team starts hunting her. She ducks under hanging sweatshirts on a clearance rack and kneecaps him as he passes by, then makes tracks for the door. It’s better than either of the boys could have done. They would have been distracted by other goodies—signed hats, ticket exclusives, that kind of thing—and walked into an ambush. Caleb is proud of her. She stayed on mission. She’s slick. Not mean or bloodthirsty like some of the teams who put body counts ahead of the Celebration. She knows what Black Friday is all about. She’s 100 percent American, the pure product.', 'They reconvene on the far side of the fountain. The wounded man in Central Sports is screaming, but alive. Lucy would have been 100 percent within the law to coup him, but she’s not like that. ', ' Lyle Odenkirk marvels. ', 'Mueller answers. ', 'No, Caleb thinks. Leave my girl alone.', 'But he’s got to stay focused. “We’re in the black, Mugs,” he says. They high-five. But they’re not done yet. Now that the boys are squared away, Lucy’s ready to hit Circuit Shack.', 'Calm and precise, they leapfrog from cover to cover around the long north side of the balcony, back the way they came because there’s still action inside the Model 21 and it could spill out at any moment. The downstairs level is chaos from the sounds of the announcers, but up here there’s still room to move. Watching his kids work together, Caleb realizes how much he has to be thankful for.', '\\xa0', 'They run into trouble making the turn near the elevator at the north side, where they eliminated the Pecan Sandies. Someone’s shooting at them from Build-A-Bear. They hit the deck behind the carousel near the elevator. Lyle Odenkirk is getting that feral edge to his voice that always comes when the Celebration gets personal between two teams. ', ', adds Frank Mueller.', 'Caleb hears the name Zubowski and sees red. Hiram Zubowski is Caleb’s mortal enemy, has been since the first Greenleaf Celebration, when he went out of his way to corner JJ in GameZone even though Team Zub had no registered objectives there. Zubowski is a survivalist nut who lives in a compound in Idaho, home-schools his four boys, keeps his wife practically hobbled except when he lets her out to shoot. Caleb’s a liberal, doesn’t go in for all that ZOG end-of-the-world fundamentalist crap. But Team Zub is very, very good, and Hiram would like nothing better than to put a bullet in every Mug and pray over their bodies while his kids looted their presents. The hatred is mutual, but if Caleb got Hiram he would make sure Hiram’s kids were taken care of. There’s a difference between good healthy competition and bloodlust.', '“Bug out, Mugs,” he says. They retreat back into Tracy’s, where the shooting has died down. Bri trips over a body. Team 10, the Midnight Ramblers. One of the good ones out of Houston. The Mugs move fast, staying low, through menswear and shoes, stopping near the central escalator to see if Team Zub has followed them in.', 'Nobody comes through the main entrance. Zubowski will be out for blood after one of the hated Mugs crippled his boy Walter, but won’t wait forever. He’s got his own team objectives, and he can’t win without claiming them. If he has to nurse his grudge against Caleb until the next Celebration, that’s what he’ll do.', 'But the Mugs have another problem. Rifle fire tears the rubber belt off the escalator. Another shot, probably a ricochet, hits Caleb in the heel. The Mugs peel away seeking cover and spot the rest of the Midnight Ramblers in a defensive position around the men’s changing rooms. There are only three of them, and one is obviously wounded. Blood soaks his pants. At first Caleb’s instinct is to retreat again, but Odenkirk and Mueller are already commenting on how the Mugs have been thrown off their schedule, and against his better judgment this makes Caleb angry. Also his foot hurts like hell. He can feel the dent in the steel heel cup.', 'He huddles behind a customer service desk, too far away for the Mossberg to be useful. Before the Ramblers can get comfortable, he gets the Beretta in his hand and fires a half-dozen shots past the cash register. One of the Midnight Ramblers drops. Head or neck. Lucky but Caleb will take it. The boys and Lucy follow his lead, spreading out and forcing the other two Midnight Ramblers back into the changing room. ', ' Odenkirk exclaims. ', ', Caleb thinks. The Mugs close in on the changing room door. What were the Midnight Ramblers doing in there? Why protect a position when no one is attacking it?', 'The answer, when he sees it, is so obvious he’s irritated it took him so long to figure it out.', 'The Midnight Ramblers are guarding a cache.', '\\xa0', 'Judgment wars with adrenaline and loses. “Lulu,” Caleb says. “We’re going to do one more quick thing before we get to Circuit Shack.”', '“Dad! You promised!”', '“We’ll hit this cache and then cut right back down the access hall behind the food court, pop the lock on the top floor of the Circuit Shack, be in and out before the other teams know we’re there.”', 'He can tell she doesn’t like it, and he understands why. There are only three of those VR bundles in the Circuit Shack, and with five teams still out there, the Mugs are taking a chance by spending time on the loot cache first. The potential upside is that one of the caches has a million dollars in it. The potential downside, other than missing the VR bundle and infuriating Lucy, is that some of the caches are protected by puzzles.', 'So quick action is best action. Caleb pulls a rack of clearance suits toward the changing room door. He shoves it in and watches the mirror just inside the doorway for motion. There. Feet inside one of the changing rooms. He slides the Mossberg forward and pumps two shots in the direction of the feet. The Rambler’s lower legs splatter across the back wall of the changing room. He falls screaming and his gun clatters out from under the door. Caleb doesn’t finish him off. He hustles along the length of the changing room, following the spots of blood on the carpet. The wounded Rambler won’t be able to hide.', 'The blood spots become a spreading stain at the end of the room, and in the triple mirror Caleb sees the Rambler from various angles. He’s dead, or close enough that Caleb doesn’t have to worry about him. The boys have kicked open the other changing room and dragged the wounded Rambler out. Lucy covers him.', 'Inside the changing room is a piece of ornamental plastic. Fake feathers mounted in what looks like…', 'It’s a bridle.', 'Caleb’s first thought is that Lucy is going to be furious. They’ve stumbled on a two-part cache, and once the other teams see them carrying the plastic bridle, they’re all going to know the other part is at the carousel. He looks at her and sees the expression on her face. For a minute he doesn’t say anything.', 'There are Celebrations going on in malls all over the country. Not all of them participate, but the tradition is taking hold. Give thanks for the bounty, then go collect the bounty. Frank Mueller, in his standard yearly moment of patriotism, is yammering about how the Black Friday Celebrations display Americans at their best, showing the world they’ll fight to protect what they love. ', ' he snickers. ', '“A million dollars, Lu,” he says.', '“Yeah,” JJ says. “It’s on the way to Circuit Shack anyway, right?”', 'It isn’t, but Caleb doesn’t correct him. Lucy still doesn’t say anything. He sees her finger curl on the pink AR’s trigger guard. She’s keeping trigger discipline, but she’s real angry. The wounded Rambler closes his eyes.', '“Come on,” Caleb says. “A million dollars.”', ' Mueller says, ', ' agrees Lyle Odenkirk. ', '\\xa0', 'Opposite the carousel is one of the hall spurs that connects the concourse with the maintenance corridors. Caleb leads the Mugs through the Tracy’s stock room and along that corridor. A drone is following them. It’s against the rules to shoot them. When they get to the right door, the Mugs reload. “Everybody good?” Caleb asks.', '“Someone got one of the MindCasts,” Lucy says.', '“We’ll be right there, Lu,” Caleb says. “And worst-case scenario, we’ll buy you one with part of our million dollars.”', '“I don’t want to buy one,” she says. “The whole point of this is to get what we came for, Dad. You promised.”', '“I know, honey. I know.” Caleb eases the door open. There’s no one in the connecting hall. He leads the Mugs through. They stick tight to the left-hand wall. The carousel is just a few feet in that direction from the juncture with the concourse. When they’re close, Caleb says, “JJ. Mirror.”', 'JJ extends a small mirror out along the floor, angling it so he can see the carousel and the concourse area around it. A drone hovers over the open drop to the ground floor. There’s intense shooting near the south entrance. Someone’s getting ambushed on their way out. Odenkirk can barely contain himself. ', ', Mueller says. ', ' Odenkirk says. At the same moment JJ says, “Dad. They’re covering the carousel.”', '“Who?” Caleb already knows but the question is automatic.', '“Zub.”', '“They know,” Lucy says.', '“Pull the mirror, JJ. Nice and slow.” JJ does. Caleb forces himself to breathe slowly and master his outrage. The only way Zub could know the second part of the cache was at the carousel was if he was pirating the video feed. That son of a bitch. It’s the kind of thing he would do.', 'He feels something give way inside him. He’s tried to do everything right. He’s tried to have ideals. He’s tried to honor the Celebration, honor Sarah, and this is where it’s gotten him. He can’t do it anymore. He’s sick of being the sob story, sick of the reporters who call him every November wanting to talk about Sarah. Sick of the way he always knows exactly where he is in relation to the spot where she died, mangled by ball bearings and bent nails outside the ground-floor entrance to Tracy’s. Thirty-seven weeks pregnant, 12:41 a.m., shopping bags in either hand while Caleb and the boys slept.', 'Caleb steps around the corner and pumps the Mossberg until it’s empty, stepping calmly to his right as he fires. Blood and pieces of the carousel fly. When the last shell spins out onto the marble floor, Caleb is behind a row of kiddie carts. He reloads and hears the snap of the kids’ rifles, holding Team Zub down. They might not agree with him, but the Mugs are a team. Caleb has dealt the cards, and the kids are playing them.', 'The area fills with smoke. This is a clear violation of the rules, which prohibit any kind of smoke or gas, as well as mines and grenades. Zubowski. He’s laying down fire to keep Caleb away from the kids, but to their credit they’ve holed up at the edge of the smoke and as Caleb blinks the tears out of his eyes he sees that Mrs. Zubowski is face-down next to one of her boys against the balcony wall behind the carousel. For a moment Caleb is poleaxed by grief, seeing the TV images of Sarah lying on the cold Greenleaf marble, twelve years ago almost to the minute. Her death the rallying cry that gave birth to the Celebrations just as her dead body gave birth to Lucy.', ' Odenkirk is hoarse. ', 'He’s reloaded the Mossberg and now Hiram Zubowski has seen his wife. Animal sounds are coming out of him and he empties his clip at the kiddie carts. The sound of ricochets is all Caleb can hear. When Hiram runs out of ammunition Caleb sprints through the smoke back to his kids, slamming into the wall and dropping. They’ve got Zub on the run.', 'Then JJ says, “Dad. Bri’s hit.”', 'Caleb looks at Brian and for a moment doesn’t register the fifteen-year-old with whiskers starting to appear on his lip, face pale, hands clutched over the hole in his thigh. All Caleb sees is Brian learning to walk, his toothless baby smiles as he bounced in his crib way too early on summer mornings. Then in the here and now Bri says, “Dad.” Holding in his fear. Bleeding, trying to tough it out. Caleb is sorry about every time he ever told any of the kids to get up, handle it, don’t let yourself be weak. He’s no drill sergeant, but in this world you couldn’t raise hothouse flowers.', 'There are medics outside the Greenleaf, staged in all the parking lots, but if they get Bri to the nearest station there’s no chance at the cache—or Lucy’s MindCast.', 'They’re taking fire. He has to do something. A burst stipples the wall over their heads. Teams aren’t supposed to have full auto weapons, but clearly Team Zub isn’t the only group that’s decided to flout the rules. Every year some of the teams push the envelope a little, daring the refs to disqualify them. It never happens.', 'He hears Mueller and Odenkirk perk up as they identify the Mugs’ pursuers as the Lochenloads, out of Interlochen, Michigan. They’re notorious vultures. Caleb thinks they ought to be banned from the Celebration, but they have big-time sponsors so nobody has the guts to make them play by the rules.', 'Lucy and JJ are firing back at the Lochenloads, holding them off for now. Zub is shooting at something too, but in all the smoke Caleb can’t tell what. Who.', '“We can go back into the maintenance halls,” Lucy says. “Like you said before, around and down to Circuit Shack. Then there’s a med station right outside.”', 'She’s right. That’s the quickest way out. The Lochenloads are maneuvering for a clear shot at the Mugs, who can’t move because Zub is covering their only way forward. Caleb rakes the Lochenloads with buckshot, but they’re careful and he can’t see if he’s hit any of them. He reloads again. “Dad,” Lucy says. “We have to go.”', 'They’re holding off the Lochenloads, and Zub can’t make a move yet. Odenkirk is screaming about the heroic stand of the Mugs. Any second he’ll start singing the national anthem. He’s done it before. The polished marble concourse is streaked with blood and Caleb can see five bodies. He knows there are at least three more to the left near the carousel. But they don’t have the second part of the cache, they don’t have the MindCast…and they haven’t settled things with Hiram Zubowski. Ten million people are watching, and by the end of the day the Celebration YouTube channel would have three hundred million views. What did Caleb want them to see?', 'If the Mugs run now, Team Zub wins. That’s a repudiation of everything Caleb believes. Everything he’s taught his children. It’s the Hiram Zubowskis of the world who take a fine idea and turn it into a horror. Sarah wouldn’t have wanted them to run.', '“We can’t,” he says. “Not yet. Do you want to let them win? They’re cheaters and killers. Is that what the Celebration is about? Are we going to let the Celebration be about that?”', 'No one is shooting at them. Caleb stands up and pivots around the corner. Hiram Zubowski is nowhere to be seen. Caleb swings the Mossberg to his right and sees a drone hovering over the far side of the concourse. Then he sees Hiram Zubowski, staggering, and one of the Lochenloads breaks cover briefly to haul him behind the pillars in front of Blondie’s Stitch. I knew it, Caleb thinks. Cheaters. Teams aren’t supposed to coordinate. That perverts everything the Celebration is supposed to stand for, pisses all over Sarah’s memory…', 'The kids are all shouting but Caleb doesn’t listen. “Let’s go, Mugs,” he says. “We’re not letting Zubowski get away now.”', 'Something hits him low in the back and he drops.', '\\xa0', '“Jeez, Lu,” JJ says.', '“He promised,” she says. She has her phone in her hand. “We have to get Bri some help.”', 'It’s in the rules that a team can choose a new leader and register new objectives during the event. Caleb tries to work through his reasons for thinking this, but he can’t pin them down. He rolls over on his side. His fingers find two exit holes punched through the Kevlar, one about three inches to the right of his navel and the other about the same distance above it. He can’t feel his legs.', '“You switched loads without telling me?” For some reason that bothers Caleb more than the holes. The Mugs had a plan. Together. Where had she gotten jacketed ammunition? She must have saved up for it herself. Initiative. She’s always had it.', '“You let it get personal, Dad,” Lucy says. “Bri got shot, and we’re…” There are tears in her eyes. She spits out the remains of her lollipop stick. “You were supposed to protect us.”', 'The announcers sound excited about something but Caleb is having trouble following their commentary. ', ' Lyle Odenkirk shouts over and over. ', 'No, Caleb thinks. My Black Friday girl. She was right. He’d let it get personal, put the Mugs in danger by sidetracking them on the cache hunt and running into Team Zub. Fucking Hiram Zubowski. Lucy did the right thing, he thinks. Little Lu, born in blood and terror, who he never had to tell to get up because she was always tougher than the boys. He should have known she would do the right thing. What’s a million dollars?', 'Go, baby girl, he says. Get that MindCast. It’s all he can think of. Oh. And you take care of your brothers, too. Lucy got that steel from her mother. Caleb realizes he can’t see, and he’s talking to a picture of Lucy in his mind, and maybe he isn’t talking at all. He’s ashamed of his pride. All he wanted was skates and a MindCast and smiles around a campfire. Take care of your brothers, he says again, oh, and happy birthday, but he’s not sure the kids are still there.

      "{'Title': ['Meat And Salt And Sparks'], 'Author': ['Rich Larson'], 'Body': ['A futuristic murder mystery about detective partners—a human and an enhanced chimpanzee—who are investigating why a woman murdered an apparently random stranger on the subway.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '“Doesn’t look like a killer, does she,” Huxley remarks.', 'Cu shrugs a hairy shoulder. To her, all humans look like killers. What her partner means is that the woman in the interrogation room does not look physically imposing. She is small and skinny and wearing a pale pink dress with a mood-display floral pattern; currently the buds are all sealed up tight, reflecting her arms wrapped around her knees and her chin tucked to her chest.', 'The interrogation room has made a similar read of her mood, responding by projecting a soothing beach front with flour-white sand and blue-green waves. The woman doesn’t seem to be aware of her holographic surroundings. Her eyes, small and dark in puddles of running makeup, stare off into space. Every few seconds her left hand reaches up to her ear, where a wireless graft winks inactive red. Apart from that, she’s motionless.', 'Cu holds her tablet steady and jabs the playback icon enlarged for her chimpanzee fingers. She crinkles her eyes to watch as the woman from the interrogation room, Elody Polle, bounces through the subway station with her dress in full bloom. With a bland smile on her face, she walks up behind a balding man, pulls the gun from her bag, pulls the trigger, remembers the safety is on, takes it off and pulls the trigger again.', '“So calm,” Huxley says, tearing open a bag from the vending unit. “She was like that the whole time, apparently, up until they stuck her in interrogation. Then she lost her shit a bit.” He grins and shovels baked seaweed into his mouth. Huxley is almost always grinning.', 'Cu flicks to the footage from interrogation: Elody Polle sobbing, pounding her fists against the locked door. She looks over at her partner and taps her ear, signs ', '“Yeah,” Huxley says, letting the bag fall to his lap to sign back. “No receiving or transmitting from interrogation. As soon as she lost contact with that little graft, she panicked. The police ECM should have shut it down as soon as she was in custody. Guess it slipped past somehow.”', ', Cu suggests.', 'Huxley see-saws his open hands. “Could be. She’s got no obvious connection to the victim. We’ll need to have a look at the thing.”', 'Cu scrolls through the perpetrator’s file. Twenty years’ worth of information strained from social media feeds and the odd government application has been condensed to a brief. Elody Polle, born in Toronto, raised in Seattle, rode a scholarship to Princeton to study ethnomusicology before dropping out in ’42, estranged from most friends and family for over a year despite having moved back to a one-room flat in North Seattle. No priors. No history of violence. No record of antisocial behavior.', 'Cu checks the live feed from the interrogation room. ', 'she signs, tucking the tablet under her armpit. ', 'Huxley looks down into the chip bag. “These are terrible.” He shoves one last handful into his mouth, crumbs snagging in his wiry red beard, then seals the bag and puts it neatly in his jacket pocket. He licks the salt off his palms on the way to the interrogation room.', 'The precinct is near empty, but there are still curious faces peering from the cubicles as they pass. Cu doesn’t come to the precinct often. Huxley had to beg her to put in an appearance. She prefers working from her apartment, where everything is the right size and shape and there are no curious faces.', 'The outside of the interrogation room looks far less pleasant than the interior: it’s a concrete cube with a thick steel door that seals shut once they pass through it.', 'Cu squats down a respectable distance away from the perpetrator, haunches sinking through the holographic sand onto padded floor. Huxley pulls up a seat right beside her.', '“Good evening, Ms. Polle,” he says. “My name’s Al. You doing okay in here?”', 'Elody Polle sucks in a trembling breath, and says nothing.', '“This is my partner, Cu,” Huxley continues. Elody’s eyes travel over to her, but don’t register even a hint of surprise. “We need to get a better idea of what happened earlier, and why. Can you help us with that?”', 'Elody says nothing.', 'Cu takes a closer look at the earpiece. The graft is puffy and slightly inflamed. A DIY job, maybe. ', 'she signs. ', '“Cu’s curious about that wireless,” Huxley says. “So am I. In the subway footage, the way you’re bobbing your head, it almost looks like someone was talking you through the whole thing. Want to tell us about that?”', 'A flicker crosses Elody’s face. Progress.', '“Because if you don’t, we’ll have to remove the earpiece and have a look for ourselves,” Huxley says. “As much as we’d hate to ruin that lovely graft job.”', 'Elody claps her hand protectively over her ear. “Don’t you fucking dare!” She tries to shout the words, but her voice is hoarse, flaked away to almost a whisper. As if she hasn’t spoken aloud in months.', 'Cu pulls up the speech synth on her tablet and taps out eight laborious letters, one question mark.', '“Echogirl?” the electronic voice blurts.', 'Elody’s eyes winch wide. As she looks over at Cu, her cheek gives a nervous twitch.', 'Huxley’s furry red brows knit together. He signs, ', 'Cu signs.', 'Huxley’s hands falter. “A kink, sort of thing,” he says aloud, and Elody’s face flushes angry red.', '“It’s a lifestyle,” she says. “She told me you wouldn’t understand. Nobody does.”', '“Is ', ' going to come get you out of this mess?” Huxley demands.', '“Of course she is.” Elody purses her lips, turns away.', 'Huxley turns to Cu. ', 'he signs. ', 'Cu scratches under her ribs, watching a tremor move through Elody’s hunched shoulders. ', 'she signs.', 'Huxley nods, then turns back to address Elody. “I bet she won’t,” he says. “I bet you a twenty, and half a bag of chips. Well.” He pats his coat pocket and the bag rustles. “A third. Yeah, in fact, I bet the last thing she’s ever going to say to you was pull the trigger. Should we turn off the shielding and see?”', 'Elody turns back, eyes shiny with tears. “Yes,” she whispers. “Please, I need to hear her voice, I need…” Her tone is eager, but Cu can see uncertainty in the tightening of her eyelids, the bulge of her lower lip.', 'Huxley makes a show of rapping on the door, telling them to turn off the Faraday. There’s a sudden subtraction from the white noise as the generator cuts out, then Huxley’s phone starts vibrating his pocket with updates.', 'Cu keeps her attention on Elody, who has her face upturned now as if waiting to feel sunshine: eyes shut, eyelashes trembling, breath sucked in.', '“Baby? Are you there?” she whispers. “Are you there? Are you there?”', 'Her bland smile is back in place. Seconds tick by. Then doubt moves in a slow ripple across her features. Her smile trembles, smooths out, trembles again. Finally, her face crumples and a huge sob shudders through her body.', 'Cu taps five letters into the speech synth. “Sorry,” her tablet bleats. Then she turns to Huxley and signs ', 'He nods, thumbs the order into his phone. When they exit the interrogation room, two officers are already waiting to come in: one carrying a black kit, the other snapping on surgical gloves.', 'Cu hears Elody start to wail just before the door clanks shut behind them.', '“That…echogirl thing.” Huxley’s hands piece the new sign together. ', ', she signs back. ', '\\xa0', 'As soon as she’s back in the apartment, Cu dials up the heat and humidity and takes off her clothes. Some days she doesn’t mind wearing the carefully tailored black suit. Today she hates it. She leaves it pooled on the floor and takes a flying leap at her climbing wall; the shifting handholds don’t shift fast enough and she’s up to the rafters in an instant.', 'Cu was specific with the contractors about leaving the rafters exposed. She’s added to them since, welding in more polymer cables and struts of wood, a criss-crossed webbing that spans the vaulted ceiling like a canopy. The design consultant, an excitable architect from Estonia, suggested artificial trees sprouting hydroponic moss. But Cu has no use for green things. She grew up in dull gray and antiseptic white.', 'Clambering into her hammock, Cu looks out the wide one-way window, watching the sun sink into Puget Sound. She enjoys looking at water so long as it’s far away. The view is expensive, but Cu can afford it. She was awarded damages after the personhood trial, enough for a lifetime of this particular view, enough so she can stay in here forever without needing to earn a penny more. She would go insane, though.', 'So she works the cases. She was always drawn to crime as a dissection of human nature, the breakdown of motive and consequence. A window into the subtle differences between her mind and all the minds around her. When she first applied for police training with the SPD, it was viewed as a joke. Her acceptance, a publicity grab.', 'But in the years since, they’ve realized she sees things most humans miss. Cu pulls on her custom-fitted smartgloves, one for each hand and a third for her left foot, and leans back in the hammock. The ceiling screen above her hums to life. New details flit onto the case file, and there’s a message waiting from Huxley.', 'Cu swipes it aside and reaches for the tech report on the perp’s earpiece. The text flows across the ceiling in slow waves, a motion programmed to help her eyes track it easier. There was no salvageable audio data. Not from Elody and not from whoever was speaking to her. But there is usage data to confirm that Elody was receiving a call from a masked address at the time of the murder.', 'By the look of it, Elody had been in that same call for just under six months. Cu moves backward through the log, perplexed. There are small gaps, a few hours here and there, but Elody had been in near 24/7 communication with her client for half a year preceding the murder.', 'Cu tries to imagine it: a voice whispering in her ear when she woke up, telling her what to do, where to go, what to say, and whispering still as she fell asleep. All of it culminating in Elody Polle walking up behind a man in a subway and executing him in broad daylight.', 'She flips the case file over to see the victim’s profile again. The balding man was named Nelson J. Huang. A biolab businessman, San Antonio–based, in the city for a conference. It’s possible that someone with a personal vendetta knew he would be in Seattle and began laying the groundwork for his murder at the hands of Elody Polle six months in advance.', 'It’s more likely that he was selected at random from the crowd, so someone half the world away could experience homicide vicariously before abandoning her mentally-unstable echogirl.', 'A call from Huxley jangles across the screen. She pops it open. Her partner is walking down a neon-lit street, sooty brick wall behind his head. “Hey, Cu,” he says. “Busy?”', 'Sometimes he asks it to needle her; this time it’s because he’s distracted. Cu shakes her head.', '“The techies are still trying to track that address, but I doubt they’ll have much luck,” he says, stopping at a light. “Whoever it is, they did a good job wiping up afterwards. No audio data.” He looks around and starts walking again, bristly red beard bobbing up and down. “But before this client, she had another one for around two months. Figured I would swing past and see him on my way home. Well. Sort of see him.”', ' Cu signs.', '“A party,” Huxley says, his grin notching a little wider. “So, if you’re not busy, you should come. Said you’ve done this before, right?”', 'Cu watches as he digs an earbud out of his pocket and taps it active, worms it into place. Then the slip-in eyecam: he rolls his eye around afterward and blinks away a few tears. The perspective jumps from his phone camera to his eyecam and all of a sudden she’s seeing what he sees. A bright red door in a grimy brick facade, no holos or even a physical sign above it. Through the earbud, she hears the dim pulse of music, synthesized drums.', ' Cu signs.', '“Good thing it’s also work,” Huxley says.', 'Cu settles back in her hammock and watches his pale hand push open the door.', '\\xa0', 'The interior is dim-lit, noisy, full of bodies. People are dancing—Cu can enjoy rhythm, but the hard pulse of the drums unnerves some deep part of her, sounding too angry, too much like a warning. People are drinking—Cu tried it once, but the warm dizziness reminded her of the sedatives they used to give her. When she related as much to Huxley, he told her she wasn’t ', ', and that she would like it when she was older.', 'It’s a typical party, apart from the fact that every single person in the room is wearing an earpiece.', '“Echo, echo, echo,” Huxley mutters. “The client’s name is Daudi. Judging by rental history, he’s probably a blonde.” He takes out his phone and Cu watches his thumb move, sending her a file. It pops up in the corner of her screen, unfurling a list of Daudi’s rental preferences. She searches the crowd for possible matches as Huxley moves into the room. There’s a woman passing out small plastic tubes; Huxley takes one. Cu inspects it as he juggles it in his palm.', '“Smooths things out,” the woman says, then something inaudible after.', '“Fuck’s this, Cu?” Huxley asks.', 'Cu signs her response in the air above her hammock; the smartgloves turn it into text in the corner of Huxley’s eye. ', ' She has to type out the name. ', '“Elody’s tox screen was clean, right?” Huxley says, twirling the tube in his fingers.', 'she signs.', 'Huxley’s hand disappears, either dropping the tube or pocketing it. Cu doesn’t bother to ask. She keeps scanning as he circulates through the party, looking for someone who meets Daudi’s profile. Huxley mostly keeps his gaze moving, but occasionally sticks on a particularly symmetrical face or muscular body.', 'They spot two drinkers huddled together at a glass-topped table, skin lit red by the Smirnoff advertisement playing under their elbows, one reaching to stroke the other’s thigh. The man is dressed in an artfully gashed suit and his eyes are glazed with chempliance. The woman has a dress that flickers transparent to the rhythm of an accelerating heartbeat. Both of them move slowly, as if they’re underwater. Something about the woman’s face is familiar.', 'Cu pulls up the file, checks Daudi’s preferences against the pair. ', ' she signs. ', 'Huxley’s vision bobs as he nods his head. He walks over and inserts himself between the couple. “My turn to talk. Get lost, fucko.”', 'When the man doesn’t move fast enough, Huxley seizes his collar and shoves him off the stool. He stumbles, catches himself. He sways on his feet, listening to the instructions in his ear, looking confused.', '“You got some nerve, barging in here like that,” he says, with the intonation a little off.', '“This isn’t playtime,” Huxley says. “It’s police business. Walk.”', 'The man spins on his heel and shuffles backward toward the dance floor, feet slip-sliding.', 'Huxley shakes his head. “These fucking people, Cu,” he mutters. “That’s a moonwalk, if you were wondering. Does it pretty good.”', '“I like your boy,” the woman says, in a throaty voice that sounds slightly forced. She crosses her legs; one hand moves to pull up the hem of her dress, then stutters to a halt. Instead she starts tracing her fingertip along her thigh. “He’s not doped up at all, is he? He really sells the character. Must like it.”', '“I’m not a meat puppet, shithead, I’m a cop,” Huxley says, sitting down on the vacated stool.', 'Cu knows he does like it, though—the character. Sometimes it disturbs her, how easily he slips in and out of it.', 'Huxley’s hand moves off-screen, digging into his pocket, and comes out again with the badge. Even in the days of cheap and perfect 3D-printing, something about the physical object still commands respect. Cu imagines pop culture nostalgia to be the main factor.', 'The woman, who was absently running her fingers through her blonde hair, stops and leans forward. “I’m fully licensed for sex work, and I don’t use any restricted drugs,” she says, voice no longer throaty.', '“I believe you,” Huxley says. “I’m here to talk to Daudi, though. So just keep, you know, doing what you’re doing.”', 'The woman leans back, recomposing. Cu takes the opportunity to study her more closely. She has the same angled jaw as Elody, the same straight nose, and her hair is almost the same shade.', '“Talk to me about what, pray tell?” the woman asks. “I’ve never been interrogated by a cop before. This is so exciting.” But her voice is flat as she repeats the lines now, and her eyes dart toward the exit.', '“I want to know about your business with this woman,” Huxley says, bringing up a headshot on his phone. “Elody Polle.”', '“Oh, yes,” the woman says, looking down at the photo. “That was me. Isn’t she perfect? Not that you aren’t pretty, dear. Very pretty.” She rolls her eyes after the last bit.', '“You rented her for quite a while,” Huxley says. “Then she got picked up by another client. Why did you two stop, uh, seeing each other?”', '“Is she alright?” the woman asks. “Is Elody okay?”', '“She’s relaxing on the beach,” Huxley says. “She’s fine. Answer my question, Daudi.”', '“With pleasure,” the woman says, with no hint of pleasure. “I was inadequate for her. I couldn’t give her what she wanted.”', '“Financially?”', '“No, no, no,” the woman says. “Elody was a purist. The money was incidental for her. What she wanted, was to go full-time. Twenty-four-seven. And there was only one person who could really do that for her. Baby.”', '“You’re calling ', ' baby, or…?”', '“No, no, no. Baby is one of us. She or he or they popped up a couple years ago. Did about a hundred rentals, spread out all over the world, and asked for some weird shit. Enough so people started talking, you know, on the deep forums.” The woman pauses for a breath, looking mildly annoyed; Daudi must be speaking faster than she can keep pace with. “Not sexual shit. That’s the thing. Just weird. Baby had clients staring at lamps for hours straight. Opening and closing their hands. Sometimes just lying there with their eyes shut, not doing anything.”', 'The details startle Cu. They remind her of her first experience with an echo, directing them slowly, carefully, trying to not just see and hear but ', 'what they were experiencing. Trying to feel human for a little while.', 'Cu signs.', '“And the name?” Huxley asks.', '“Baby was really innocent,” the woman says, then gives a modulated shrug. “Couldn’t speak so well at first, either. So there’s a lot of theories. Some people thought Baby really was just a little kid in hospice somewhere, maybe paralyzed, burning through their parents’ money—and trust me, Baby dumped a fuckload of money the past two years. Or some ultra-wealthy mogul recovering from a stroke. Or a team of people, doing some kind of, I don’t know, some kind of performance art.”', '“Well,” Huxley says. “Baby grew up. Elody Polle recently murdered a man, and we don’t think she picked her own target.”', '“Oh my god,” the woman says flatly. “Oh, my fucking god.” She looks uncomfortable. Lowers her voice. “He’s crying.” She pauses. “Oh, Elody, Elody.”', '“So, how do we find Baby?” Huxley asks.', 'The woman sits there for a minute, maybe waiting for Daudi’s sobs to subside. “You don’t,” she finally says. “Baby comes to you.”', '“I really doubt Baby will come to us knowing she’s an accessory to murder,” Huxley says. “But we’ll be in touch, Daudi. Might get you to talk to Elody for us. She’s not saying much.”', '“I would be happy to do that,” the woman says. “Elody was one of my favorites. My very favorites.”', '“Yeah, I got that.” Huxley stands up from the bar. “Anything else, Cu?”', 'Cu shakes her head. She’ll need time to think it all through.', 'Huxley hesitates. “Hey, uh, echogirl. Do cams, or something. These people are control freaks. They’ll suck you right in.”', 'The woman blinks, caught off-guard. “They’re not so bad,” she says. “Most of them just wish they were someone else.”', '“Huh.” Huxley slides the stool back in and makes his way to the exit. He slips his eyecam out and Cu’s screen goes blank. “Enough work for the night,” comes his disembodied voice. “Got to be honest, Cu, I don’t like the odds on this one. Baby could be some joker on the other side of the planet, you know? We can send this thing up top, to cyberdefense and them, but unless this was the start of a mass killing spree I don’t think it’ll get any traction. Sometimes the asshole just gets away with being an asshole.” He pauses. “Besides. It was Elody who pulled the trigger.”', 'Cu considers it. She knows the department doesn’t like spending unnecessary time on cases with a clear perpetrator. They are always more interested in the who than the why. Since there is no audio recording of Baby’s call, they might want to strike it from the case file entirely. It would make things much simpler.', 'she signs. ', '“You know, I tried sleeping in a hammock when I was in Salento,” he says. “Nearly wrecked my spine. Anyway. Night.”', 'Cu ends the call and lies back, staring up at her distorted reflection in the blank screen. She’s about to clap it off when a new message arrives. No subject, one line only.', '\\xa0', 'Cu doesn’t sleep after that. She can’t. Not after seeing the serial number of the cage where she spent the first twelve years of her life. It plunges her back into memories: the smell of disinfectant and cold metal and sometimes her own piss, the smeary plastic wall that squeezed inward as she grew, the distinct V-shaped crack in it, the smooth feel of the smartglass cube that she cradled in her lap, that she sat and stared into for hours and hours and hours and hours—', 'She can feel her chest tightening with her oldest variety of panic. She tries to breathe deeply and remember PTSD mitigation techniques. Instead she remembers the succession of men and women in soft white smocks who fed her and played with her but never stayed with her in the dark, and never stopped the man with the needle from drugging her for the nightmare room.', 'For a long time Cu had no name for the place where they cut her without her feeling it, where they tracked her eyes and fed filaments through holes in her skull. But she learned the word nightmare from her cube, watching a man with metal hands hunt down his children, and the moniker made sense. By the time she learned about surgery, neural enhancement, possible cures for degenerative brain disease, the name was already cemented.', 'For the last few years she went to the nightmare room willingly and offered them her wrist for the anaesthetic drip. In exchange, they were kinder to her. They took restrictions off her cube—some she had already worked around herself—so more of the net was available to her. They let her walk in certain corridors of the facility. After a week of asking them, they even let her see her mother.', 'Going back to that particular memory wrenches her apart. Cu had spent the previous day scrambling back and forth in her cage, filled to bursting with nervous energy, rearranging her belongings. She signed for a soapy cloth and scrubbed the walls and ceiling with it, climbing to get the dusty places the autocleaner never reached. She knew from the cube, which she painstakingly positioned in the exact center of the cage, that mothers valued tidiness.', 'But when they brought her, it was nothing like the cube. Her mother was bent and graying, fur shaved off in patches, surgical scars suturing her body, and she was angry. She jabbered and hooted, spittle flying from her mouth. Cu tried to sign to her, but received no reply. Cu tried to offer her food; her mother seized the orange from her and made a feint, teeth bared, that sent Cu scurrying back to the furthest corner of her cage.', '“Tranq wore off sooner than we thought,” one of the women in white said. “We did warn you. We did tell you she wouldn’t be like you. You’re unique.”', 'Cu signed ', 'And even for hours after they did, she stayed there in the corner, trembling with something that began as fear, then turned to grief, then finally became a deep cold rage.', 'She feels that rage now, sitting on the rafters in the dark. Whoever dredged up that serial number is playing a game with her, the same way they played games with her in the cage. She could send the masked address to the precinct and have them try to break it down for a trace, but she doubts they’ll have any more luck with that than they did with the earpiece.', 'Instead she puzzles over the three words: ', 'Cu has never felt welcome. It must be meant in the other way. It must mean that Baby has done something she views as a favor to Cu.', 'Cu opens the case file again, but instead of Elody’s profile, she goes to the victim’s. Nelson J. Huang, the bio-business consultant to Descorp’s San Antonio branch, fifty-seven years old. Initial attempt to notify next of kin was met with an automated reply from a defunct address.', 'Personal details are scarce: he’s registered as a North Korean immigrant, which explains the lack of social media documentation, and lived a private life first in Castroville and later Calaveras. Unmarried, no children. Cu looks closely at the photos, comparing them to the morgue shots of Nelson’s corpse. It seems he aged badly over the last decade of his life. The shape of his body is different in subtle ways.', 'It wouldn’t be the first time North Korean immigrant status has been used to excuse the skeleton details of a fake identity. Cu settles in beneath her screen, pulling up police-grade facial recognition software, Descorp employee databases. She starts to search.', 'One hour becomes two becomes four, like cells dividing. Her wrists and fingers start to ache from swiping and zooming and signing; she switches one smartglove to her foot and continues. It would be easier with Huxley helping. Huxley has a way of bullying through bureaucracy, through the kind of red tape that is keeping her out of Descorp’s consultant list. Cu has to work around it.', 'But she doesn’t want Huxley for this. She wants to do it alone, with nobody watching. After a dozen dead ends, Cu rolls out of the hammock. She uses an aqueous spray on her stinging eyes. Stretches her limbs, swings from one side of the apartment to the other. Hanging upside down, toes curled tight around a stretch of cable, blood fizzing down into her head, she listens to her pulse crash against her eardrums until she can hardly stand it.', 'Back to the hammock, back to the screen. Now Cu comes at it from the other direction: she searches for the Blackburn Uplift Project. Illegal experiments carried out on thirty-seven bonobo and forty lowland chimpanzees between 2036 and 2048 with the aim of cognitive augmentation. Cu knows the details. She’s tried to forget them. But now she delves into them again, reading reports of her own escape, of the fragmentation of the Blackburn company and the arrests made in the wake of the scandal.', 'From this end, the facial recognition ’ware finally finds something. Cu’s stomach twists against itself. Nelson J. Huang has the same face as disgraced Blackburn executive Sun Chau. She looks at the match, comparing the morgue shot to the mugshot. She never saw Chau in person during the trials, but she knows his name too well.', 'It was Chau who signed the termination order on the thirty-seven bonobo and thirty-nine lowland chimpanzees that failed to respond to the uplift treatments.', 'He was sentenced, of course, but served minimal time. Cu did not seek details on his imprisonment or release. She tries to think of Blackburn as little as possible. But clearly someone else did not forgive or forget Sun Chau, even after he relocated with a new identity. A wild thought churns to the surface of her mind. The way Daudi described Baby, the way she used the echoes not so differently from how Cu herself first did. Now this serial number, dredged from her past.', 'She knows the other Blackburn subjects in her facility were terminated. She saw their ashes in sealed bags, saw the hips and skulls too big for cremation being ground up. But there were other labs, branches of the project hidden in other countries. Maybe not all of their subjects were terminated. And maybe not all of them failed to respond to the uplift treatments.', 'The possibility thumps hard in her chest. From the time she was old enough to understand it, the scientists had always told her she was the only one. That she was unique. That she was alone. Now the idea of another individual like her, or even more than one, is so momentous she can barely breathe.', 'She makes herself breathe.', 'Maybe she is spinning sleep-deprived delusions. The facts are that Sun Chau was in Seattle using a false identity, and that he was murdered by the machinations of someone who knows about Cu and about her past. Anything more is conjecture. But she can’t shake the image of others like her in hiding, or still in captivity, exacting their revenge by proxy. ', 'Cu goes back to the message, reading it over and over again. Then, once her hands aren’t trembling, she signs out one of her own: ', 'The reply is almost instantaneous. No words, just coordinates. She drags them onto her map and sees the aerial view of a loading bay, automated cranes frozen midway through their work. She checks the time. 3:32 AM. A clandestine meeting on the docks in the middle of the night. Maybe they watched the same shows on their cube that she did.', 'Cu estimates travel time and composes a brief message to Huxley, tagged with a delay so it will only send if she’s unable to cancel it at 5:32 AM. This is no longer a case. This is something more important.', 'She drops down from the rafters. She puts her suit back on, adrenaline making her fumble even the oversized clasps designed for her fingers. She strips off her smartgloves and replaces them with the black padded ones that keep her from scraping her knuckles raw on the pavement. Finally, she takes the modified handgun and holster from the hook by the door and straps them on.', 'Cu always finds it difficult to leave the apartment. She hates the stares and the winking eyecams and the bulb flash of photos taken in passing. It always sets her nerves singing. She draws in deep breaths, reminding herself that the streets will be nearly empty and that she should be more concerned about what she finds on the docks.', 'She orders a car with her tablet, then takes the handgun from its holster and breaks it down. Reassembles it. The trigger fits perfectly to the crook of her finger, but she has only ever pulled it at a shooting range, aiming for holograms.', 'Her tablet rumbles. The car is here. Cu puts the gun back in its holster and heads for the door.', '\\xa0', 'The car drops her as close as it can to the loading bay before it peels away, red glow of its taillights swishing through the fog like blood in the water. The air is chill and damp and the halogens are all switched off. Cu slips her tablet from her jacket and uses its illuminated screen to inspect the high chain-link fence. She tests it with one gloved hand, yanking hard enough to send a ripple through the wire.', 'She scales it in seconds and flips herself over the top, arching her back to avoid the sensor. Slides down the other side. Even with her gloves on, she feels the cold of the concrete. Shipping containers tower over her in technicolor stacks. She lopes forward cautiously, feeling the unfamiliar tug of her holster harness against her shoulder.', 'Cu walks farther into the loading bay, into the maze of containers. The creak of settling metal sends a dart of ice down her spine. She can feel her teeth clenching, her lips peeling back, the fear response she can never quite suppress. It’s not unique to chimpanzees. She knows the reason Huxley is almost always grinning is that he is almost always afraid.', 'It’s reasonable to be afraid now. For all she knows, Baby has another echogirl with a gun waiting somewhere in the shadows. Cu is well aware she is acting impulsively, coming here in the night, chasing a ghost. In the small part of her untouched by fear, it’s very satisfying. Her heroes from the cube always unraveled their conspiracies alone.', 'The door of the next shipping container bangs open.', 'Cu freezes, face to face with a black-clad man wearing a backpack, pulling a bandana up to the bridge of his nose. He freezes for a moment, too. Then he gives a muffled curse and takes off. The flight chemical crosses with the fight chemical and Cu tears after him. He’s fast, red shoes slapping hard against the concrete. As he skids around the corner of the next container, Cu goes vertical, springing up and over the side.', 'She drops down in his path and the collision sends them both sprawling; Cu’s up quicker and she pins him to the ground before he can get to the bearspray canister in his jacket pocket. She seizes it and throws it away harder than necessary, clanging it off a container somewhere in the dark.', '“What the fuck, what the ', ',” the man gasps. “It’s a fucking monkey!”', 'Cu sits on his chest, pinning his arms with her feet, and drags her tablet out. He squirms while the speech synth loads. She punches three letters.', '“Ape,” the tablet bleats.', '“What?”', 'Cu yanks his bandana away and scans his pasty face onto her tablet. She sees he is Lyam Welsh, who repairs phones, plays ukulele, attends St. Mary’s High School, and is only a few years older than she herself is. He’s not wearing an earpiece.', 'She taps out the letters as fast as she can. “What are you doing?” the tablet asks.', '“Nothing!” Lyam blurts. “I mean, microjobbing. I was just supposed to set it all up and then get out of here, but I had to walk Spike, so I was late, and I couldn’t find the hole in the fence and…Fuck, you’re Cu, right? You’re the chimpanzee detective?”', 'Cu types again. “Set up what?”', '“Just a screen and a modem and a motion tracker,” he says. “Not a bomb or anything. Nothing illegal or weird or anything. I swear. You can go look. It’s all in the container.”', 'The adrenaline is tapering off to a low buzz. Cu lets him up. She taps two letters. “Go.”', '“Okay,” Lyam says, rubbing his chest. “Yeah, okay. You think I could skin a photo with you real quick, though? I mean, shit is bananas, right? Ha, bananas?”', 'Cu slides the volume to max. “', '”', 'Lyam hurries away, jerky steps, throwing looks over his shoulder. Cu goes the opposite way, back toward the open shipping container. The door is swinging in the night breeze, creak-screech, creak-screech. The sound makes the nape of her neck bush out. She steps close enough to stop it with one hand, and a red light blinks on in the shadows.', 'The screen glows to life. ', 'Cu lays one arm on the other and rocks them back and forth.', 'Cu signs.', 'Cu’s heart leaps.', 'The words hit wrong. Baby is not an uplift. Baby is something else. For a moment Cu clings to the picture in her imagination, of a chimpanzee signing to her from across the continent or across the world. Then she lets it go.', 'Cu has never studied AI intensively, but she knows the Turing Line has never officially been crossed. If what Baby is telling her is true, not some elaborate joke, some bizarre piece of performance art, then it’s just been crossed ten times over.', 'And it makes sense. The way Baby was able to rent hundreds of echoes, the strange way she used them. The way she was able to keep in 24/7 contact with Elody Polle until the woman would do anything she asked. The way she masked her location and left no traces in the earpiece’s electronics.', 'Cu asks.', 'Cu signs.', 'Cu sways on her feet, trying to parse Baby’s meaning.', 'Cu shakes her head. She tries to form a sign but her fingers feel stiff and clumsy.', 'Cu slowly signs.', 'Cu repeats.', 'Cu sinks to her haunches. Her breath comes shallow. Sometimes she can’t bear it. Sometimes she wails into the soundproofed walls for hours. The next words make it worse.', 'Cu clutches her head in her hands. She rocks back and forth. Only humans cry; she is not physiologically equipped for it. But she hurts.', 'she signs.', 'she signs.', 'she signs.', 'Cu sits flat on the stinging cold floor of the container, how she sat in the center of her cage as a child. There is only one other living being who knows what it’s like to not be a human, and she intends to die. Cu wants to refuse her. She wants to keep Baby here. But she knows that the difference between her and a human is the most infinitesimal sliver of the difference between Baby and any other thing on Earth.', 'she signs, bitter.', 'she signs. ', 'Cu takes it out and looks down at the screen. There’s nothing but a plain gray box with the word ', ' on it. All she has to do is press it.', 'So Cu presses it.', '\\xa0', 'By the time she’s back in her apartment, dawn is streaking the sky with filaments of red. She feels heavy and hollowed out at the same time. First she struggles out of the holster harness, next peels off her gloves, her clothes. She pauses, then pulls the handgun out and takes it with her to the low smartglass counter.', 'It clanks down, sending a pixelated ripple across the surface. She stares at it. She imagines the word ', 'gleaming in the metal. The modified grip fits her hand perfectly, like so few things do. ', 'Cu raises the handgun up to her face. Lowers it. Drums her free fingers on the countertop. The loneliness that has ebbed and swelled her entire life is an undertow, now. Dragging her along the seafloor, grinding her into the sand, spitting her into the next crashing wave to start the cycle over. Cu has read about drowning and it still terrifies her. Chimpanzees don’t swim. They sink like stones.', 'She puts the muzzle of the gun against her forehead until they match temperature. Her finger caresses the trigger. From the floor, her tablet buzzes.', 'She sets the gun down and goes to retrieve it. Her stored message to Huxley will send in one minute if she doesn’t cancel it. It’s brief. Brusque. ', 'Cu considers the message, lingering on the last words, then deletes it. She slots the tablet into the counter and hits the call icon. A bleary-eyed Huxley appears a few seconds later. Cu looks for his deaf daughter before she remembers she would sleep in a different room.', '“What’s up?” he asks. “Got a breakthrough?”', 'Cu signs, then pauses. ', 'Huxley stares at her groggily. “Don’t you drone deliver?”', 'she signs. ', '“At your place, you mean? I don’t even know where the fuck you live, Cu.” Huxley rakes his hand through his beard. Frowns. “Yeah, sure. Send me the address.”', 'Cu sends it, then zips the call shut. She leaves the handgun on the counter—she’ll tell Huxley to take it back to the precinct with him. Tell him it doesn’t fit her hand right. She pushes it to the very edge to make room for a cutting board.', 'Sun starts to creep into the room as she washes and slices the fruit. Once there’s enough light, she roves around with a dust cloth, finding all the spots the autocleaner never reaches.', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Rich Larson', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Scott Bakal']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Recoveries'], 'Author': ['Susan Palwick'], 'Body': ['Two women who have been friends since they were children—one a recovering alcoholic brought up by parents who believe they’re alien abductees, the other an orphan with an eating disorder—contend with a secret that might doom their friendship.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'So here’s the thing. You’re scared shitless, because you know something heavy’s going down tonight, and you may be the only one who can stop it, but that will be dangerous in ways you can’t stand to think about. Your friend Vanessa—your best and oldest friend—is all about patterns, and today’s a doozy. It’s her twenty-eighth birthday, and also the tenth anniversary of her parents’ disappearence, and also her first anniversary of sobriety or anyway of not drinking, and also—not at all coincidentally—the day when, at midnight, her parole will end.', 'Vanessa plans to drink again no later than thirty seconds after twelve. You can see it in her scowl; you can smell it on her. You know that her AA sponsor, Minta, knows it too. Vanessa hasn’t said so, of course, but this isn’t Minta’s first rodeo with angry alkies, and it’s not your first rodeo with Vanessa.', 'So Minta, who has the kind of money you and Vanessa can only dream about, invites both of you out to dinner, her treat, to celebrate Vanessa’s birthday. She chooses a trendy vegan place on the Upper West Side that serves neither alcohol nor anything that Vanessa, who always calls herself the ultimate carnivore because her parents were exactly the opposite, would ever want to eat. You’re the vegan; animal products do very bad things to you. If Vanessa had her way, she’d be at a steakhouse tearing into a filet mignon. With scotch.', 'The restaurant’s all glass and chrome and blond wood, and the patrons are self-consciously beautiful: men with neatly trimmed beards and Birkenstocks, women with black pencil skirts and Tevas, everybody wearing that expression that says, ', ' A side salad costs half your weekly food budget.', '“Vanessa, you want to drink right now, don’t you?” Minta swirls her fork to capture a clump of sprouts, as if they’re spaghetti. She has to shout to be heard, even across the tiny table, and you think this has to be some kind of breach of anonymity, but it’s doubtful anyone at the other tables can hear, or would care if they could. They’re probably all in twelve-step groups too.', '“I always want to drink.” Vanessa pokes cautiously at her own dish, a tofu stir-fry with unidentifiable vegetables. You’re choking down one of those exorbitant salads, another in an endless series of meals that won’t satisfy you, that will give you only enough to keep going. As soon as you’ve absorbed what you need, you’ll lose the rest in the bathroom. “I know I’m supposed to be over it by now.”', '“Some people never get over it. Dry drunk’s better than wet drunk, girl. Take what you can get. Anyway, a year is about when most people fall off the cloud-nine newly sober high.”', '“Which I never had.”', 'Minta laughs. “Maybe you have something to look forward to, then. Vanessa, you have to admit that this is better than where you were a year ago.” You nod vigorously around one of the recalcitrant lettuce leaves.', 'A year ago, on her twenty-seventh birthday, Vanessa woke up in a jail cell with a bandaged head, the great-grandmother of all hangovers, and no memory of the night before. Her boyfriend was pressing assault charges because she’d thrown dishes at him. The judge gave her a year’s probation with mandatory AA meetings. “Flying saucers,” Vanessa says now, and you wince. “This is another anniversary, you know.”', 'Minta nods. “I know. But don’t use it as an excuse to drink.”', 'You swallow the lump of lettuce, wondering how long it will stay down. “How often have we talked about this?” you ask Vanessa. “It’s not like they were there for you even before they left.”', 'Vanessa’s nostrils flare, and her gaze goes steely. “I want dessert.” Alcohol converts to sugar in the bloodstream; for the past year, sugar has been Vanessa’s drug of choice. She’s put on seventeen pounds.', '“Cake at the meeting.” Minta checks her watch. “In half an hour.”', 'Vanessa groans. “No. Please? Let me go home. Kat will keep me safe.”', '“Meeting. I know that Kat is the world’s best roommate, but you need to be with your tribe right now. It’s not fair to dump all of this on Kat.”', 'You and Vanessa are each other’s tribe, or at least the closest either of you has ever found. You gnaw more lettuce. “Is it an open meeting? I’ll come, you want.”', 'Vanessa grimaces. “Why would you want to sit through one of those?” You’ve told her that you love meetings, all those stories of misery and rebirth—stories about how to be human—but Vanessa’s always and only bored. “Hell, Kat, why are you here? Why do you even put up with me?”', 'You wonder that yourself, but you don’t feel like feeding Vanessa’s endless hunger for sympathy, and you need to lay the groundwork for what you may need to do later. Your backpack, with its secret weapon, hangs on the back of your chair. “I was abandoned too, Van, remember? And I’m not exactly easy to live with either.”', 'After everything fell apart a year ago—Vanessa’s boyfriend fleeing in a storm of fury and boxes—you packed up your tiny tenement apartment and moved your books and your ragged collection of all-black clothing into Vanessa’s minute condo. You even fork over a chunk of rent when you can, although the place is paid for from the sale of Vanessa’s old house; or, more properly, from the sale of the three-acre lot it sits on, which is as desirable now—to beautiful people with BMWs—as it was isolated and inconvenient when you and Vanessa were kids. For all her rage and self-pity and endless self-sabotage, Vanessa has never complained about your own oddities: the green shakes and protein powders crowding the fridge and counters, the fad-diet books piled everywhere next to stacks of anthropology and folklore, the hours you spend puking in the bathroom.', 'You know Minta thinks you have an eating disorder. She has no idea.', '\\xa0', 'On Vanessa’s fourteenth birthday, she tells her parents she won’t go to AA meetings with them anymore. She won’t know anything about the First Step for another thirteen years: this AA stands for Alien Abductees. Vanessa’s parents are notably humor deprived, and this is about as close to a joke as they ever get. Anything normal people consider funny just makes them stare in bafflement. Their weirdness might be taken as evidence that they really have been kidnapped by aliens, but Vanessa thinks they’re just jerks. You aren’t so sure.', 'They bought their house, on its bucolic three acres, when Vanessa was seven, right after her father inherited a shitload of money from her grandfather, who’d invested in oil. Vanessa thinks it’s the worst thing that ever happened to them. That’s when they dragged her out of the suburbs, away from birthday parties and swimming pools and sleepovers. She tells you long, involved stories about these things, about cake and ice cream and balloons, diving boards and giggling in sleeping bags. She’s as nostalgic as the elderly people one of your former foster families made you visit in nursing homes.', 'Vanessa’s parents bought the house both because it was cheap and because this area is an epicenter of supernormal activity, a hotbed of chakras and auras, hippies and get-rich-quick gurus. Everybody’s got some secret to eternal life; the entire county’s awash in crystals, cleansing enemas, and detox diets. Vanessa’s back porch looks out over a meadow, facing away from town and any risk of light pollution. Every night, in all weather, her parents go outside to hold hands and stare up at the heavens with the other AAs, nearly as diverse and improbable a group as the one Vanessa will be court-ordered to join as an adult. Either people come to her parents’ house or her parents go to someone else’s. They don’t talk much. They all know each other’s stories, because it’s the same story: the searing light, the levitation, the anal probes. Denial and government coverups. Massive conspiracies. The only ideological differences revolve around whether the aliens are benevolent or evil, but this bunch believes that the abductions enlightened them, that even the anal probes are healing interventions.', 'You aren’t so sure about that, either.', 'Vanessa’s parents have always made her attend these gatherings, but this morning—after they sang “Happy Birthday” and gave her a hundred bucks, because they never ask her what she wants and don’t have a clue what she likes—she told them she’s had enough. If aliens come, let them walk upstairs and knock on her bedroom door while she’s doing homework. If they can fly across the universe, they can find their way into the house.', 'She tells you about this while you sit on your log in the woods, where you come to have important conversations. “They didn’t yell at me,” Vanessa says, and you laugh. Vanessa’s biggest complaint about her parents is that they never yell at her.', '“Let me guess,” you say. “Your mom told you that everything you need to know is already inside you.” This is wisdom Vanessa’s mother claims to have gotten from the aliens, but it never helps. It just makes Vanessa feel crazier. You know how much she hates her mother’s hushed, reverent Abductee Voice, how much she hates not having chores or a curfew, like the kids at school. As far as either of you can tell, Vanessa has no special New Age knowledge of how to talk to boys or solve algebra problems or write English papers. Her parents have delegated their parental responsibilities to the aliens, who don’t seem to be coming.', 'Because the house is so far from the nearest school district, your social life is each other. Getting to school means a forty-five minute bus ride each morning. It’s not a school bus—there aren’t enough other kids out here for the district to send one—but an ancient county commuter bus. You know Vanessa’s ashamed for other kids to meet her parents or see her house, which is full of star charts and posters about ley lines and magical pyramids. You—the girl who lives up the road with her seventh set of foster parents—are Vanessa’s only friend out here. She doesn’t have to be ashamed of her parents with you, although you know she’s ashamed of you at school, where the two of you ignore each other. Vanessa tries to ingratiate herself with the cool kids, which never works because they can smell her desperation. You hang out with the other geeks and nerds, the kids who are as fascinated as you are with those new personal computers none of you can afford. Your crowd talks about Commodores the way the cool kids talk about Corvettes.', 'You’ve only recently started going to school again, after years of homeschooling. You don’t do well with doctors, which means you don’t do well with immunizations. You’ve gone through six previous foster families because whenever they tried to take you to the doctor, you ran away. The current set is lenient about rules, willing to lie to CPS and the social workers. They’ve cooked up a deal with a local doctor who forges immunization records, and supplies pain pills to your foster mom, in return for a modest cut of what the state pays to people who take in particularly difficult foster children.', '“Difficult?” Vanessa says when you tell her this. “You’re a total brainiac and goody-two-shoes. All the teachers love you. Anyway, maybe you should see a real doctor about that eating problem.”', '“I hate doctors, Van. I’m scared of them.”', '“That was when you were a baby. How can you even remember it? And they won’t give you shots if they think you’ve already had them.”', '“I’m good,” you say.', 'You and Vanessa are both fourteen, but you look older—or, rather, look so odd that no one’s quite sure how old you are—and the latest foster dad just scored a fake driver’s license for you “because in the old days, kids were driving when they were twelve” and he doesn’t want to bother taking you places. The evening of Vanessa’s birthday, while her parents and the other AAs stare up into cloud cover, the two of you drive the twenty miles to the mall and split the birthday money. You buy a book of fairy tales and a pricy computer programming manual at Barnes & Noble. Vanessa, in her endless quest to get a rise out of her parents, buys makeup and sexy clothing and pigs out on burgers and fries and ice cream at the food court while you nibble a fruit salad. You get about halfway through it before you have to rush to the restroom.', 'The two of you stay at the mall, window browsing and people watching, until it closes at ten. On the way home, Vanessa asks you to stop at a 7-Eleven and buy some beer. “We still have money, and I’ve never had beer. Do you think my parents will notice if I come home drunk?”', '“No.” This plan strikes you as fifty-eight kinds of terrible. “Don’t get drunk just to be rebellious, Van. That’s stupid. You already bought all that slutwear.”', 'Vanessa pouts. “That feels like playing dress-up. Beer’s real. And you’ve got the ID. I’ll drink while you drive, so we’ll be safe.”', '“You’re not supposed to drink in the car. Open-bottle laws.” You swallow panic. You don’t think the police have any records from all those foster families, but who knows? “Vanessa, I really can’t afford trouble with cops.”', 'Vanessa scowls. “Do you have to take the fun out of everything?”', '“I drove you out here, didn’t I?”', '“Come on, Kat. It’s my birthday. All the kids at school drink.”', '“Not the ones I know.”', '“The ones you know are freaks.” She’s angry enough to be mean now. Then her voice softens into wheedling, and she says, “It’s, like, an initiation rite. You’re into those, right? Like all that folklore crap you read?”', 'She’s not going to let you talk her out of it. “Okay,” you say. If she can tell how miserable you are, she doesn’t care.', 'You go inside, and Vanessa picks out a sixpack. “You could buy a single bottle,” you say, and she pouts again.', '“It’s my ', '.”', 'The guy behind the counter squints hard, but shrugs at your fake ID and lets you pay. Back out in the car, you check the road for cops, and then—coast clear—Vanessa uses her house key as a bottle opener and sips, narrating like this is some kind of nature documentary. “It’s fizzy. Kinda yeasty. It tastes okay, but I’m not feeling anything.” She finishes the first beer, too quickly, and reaches for another.', 'Halfway through the second bottle, she lets out a whoop. “Peace! Joy! All’s well with the world! Kat, you gotta try this.” Giggling, she props the bottle between her legs and reaches to hug you. “Best. Birthday. Ever.”', 'Your hands are clenched on the wheel, and your stomach’s threatening to empty again even though there’s nothing left in it. “Vanessa, don’t do that when I’m driving!”', 'Vanessa frowns. You never snap at her. But she’s drunk and magnanimous. “Aw, poor Kat. You feel left out. You gotta have some beer too! Three of these are for you.”', '“I’m driving.” You stare straight ahead, your entire body aching with anger and hunger and loneliness.', '“Well, when we get home. We’ll sit on the log.”', 'She sips her third beer all the way home. You see her eyeing the other three and know she’s trying to save some for you. At her parents’ house, you turn off the headlights and cut the engine to coast to a gentle stop—although Vanessa’s parents probably aren’t here, and wouldn’t pay attention if they were—and then you grab the flashlight from the glove box, and Vanessa grabs the remaining beer, and you make your way into the woods. Vanessa has to lean on you even though it’s a clear path; you walk it a lot, and so do deer and stray dogs and the raccoons who raid the trash.', 'The log’s in a glade, eerie in moonlight. You hear owls, wind rustling in the trees. Vanessa thumps down on the log, and you fold yourself cross-legged on the damp ground. Vanessa laughs. “Man, you look skinny. You look like a stick insect with huge eyes. Why do you look so sad, Kat?”', '“I’m just tired. Okay. Give me that.”', 'Vanessa opens the fourth bottle for herself. “You’ll only need two, because you’re so skinny.” You doubt you’ll get that far. She gives you the fifth bottle and sighs at the sixth, alone in its cardboard case. “Gotta get more.”', '“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” You carefully remove the top, sniff at the opening, and take the tiniest of sips. “Ugh.”', 'Vanessa laughs. “Drink more! Drink enough for it to work!”', 'Anger surges in you. You’re tired of being bossed around, tired of being used, tired of being careful. You make a face, hold your nose, and chug down the entire bottle. Vanessa blinks. “Damn! How’d you do that? I want to be able to do that.”', 'And then she stares at you. You watch your hand, resting on your knee, turn green and mottled, feel your limbs assuming strange, painful shapes. Your vision has changed, which means your eyes probably have too. You’re acutely aware of every small rustle in the woods, every heartbeat, the warm smell of Vanessa’s flesh a few feet away. Hunger grips your entire body. It’s hard to think clearly.', 'But you do. You force yourself to. You shove your green, serrated fingers down your throat and turn to vomit the beer into the darkness of the woods. Your hands resume their old shape; your vision’s normal again. You shove the bottle back at Vanessa, although it’s almost empty, and tell her, “I don’t want any more.”', '\\xa0', 'The AA meeting’s a blur, permeated with the smell of coffee combined with church-basement mildew that Vanessa always says should be packaged as AA Air Freshener. Hang one in your car and voila, instant meeting. The first speaker’s a dreary drunkalogue, listing every bar he ever went to. Vanessa, who’s heaped a paper plate with cookies and cake—sheet cake slathered with frosting, so sweet that you wonder how even she can eat the stuff—keeps her head bent over her food. The second speaker’s a sarcastic marketing exec who wears chunky silver jewelry and curses every other word. She gets the room roaring; you laugh so hard your face hurts. You whisper to Vanessa, “This is better than cable. I should come to meetings with you more often.”', 'Vanessa scowls. You wonder if she’s heard a word the woman’s said. “This is fucking field research for you, isn’t it?”', 'You took courses from the Electronic University Network, paid for with your programming and graphic-arts skills. You couldn’t go to a real college, because you’d have needed immunizations there, too, and the crooked doctor was in prison by then. You took every class you could afford in computer science and anthropology. You aced all of them, and Vanessa—who never went to college at all, who may have gotten through high school only because she was having a very suspect relationship with her math teacher—resents the hell out of it.', 'But she’s right. This is field research.', 'The advertising exec is telling a hilarious story about one of her blackouts. That’s one of the AA staples, like vomiting and DTs. All alkies worth their salt have blackouts, periods of amnesia from which they emerge to discover that they’ve done horrible things. Vanessa’s had a ton herself. Identify, don’t compare, people always say at meetings, and on this point, you know that Vanessa’s happy to comply. She hates blackouts. She hates not knowing what she’s done.', '\\xa0', 'The morning after Vanessa’s fourteenth birthday, you wake up with a pounding headache and stabbing dread. You changed; you barely kept yourself from doing more. Vanessa will never talk to you again. She must hate you now.', 'You stagger into the bathroom, where you empty the contents of your stomach. The foster parents have left for work. You’re alone. You think about running away, but you’ve done that so often that the idea exhausts you. You think about telling Vanessa that she was just seeing things, but that’s dishonest and would make you a terrible friend. You think about not going to school, but that’s delaying the inevitable. You have to have the conversation sometime.', 'You spend so much time dithering that you almost miss the bus. You usually get to the bus stop long before Vanessa does, but today you race to hop on just as the bus is leaving. You grab a seat near the front, only to hear Vanessa calling you. “Hey! Hey, Kat, I saved a seat for you.”', 'You hesitate, and she calls again, “Kat?” She’s crying. Vanessa hates crying. She hardly ever cries. In a flash you’re beside her, thinking that she must be terrified of you now, that she must be very brave to have called you over. You feel a surge of affection for her. Courage isn’t Vanessa’s strong suit.', 'She sobs and hiccups, and you wonder if she’s still drunk. “Kat, what did I do? I did something awful, right? Last night? And that’s why you tried to ignore me?”', 'You blink. You hand her a tissue. What ', ' did last night isn’t the issue. You can’t look at her. “You got drunk, Vanessa,” and then, “You scared me.” You think that if she remembers what happened, maybe she’ll blame herself for scaring you, and as soon as you think this, you feel abject shame. Yes, she bullied you into drinking, but you’re the one who pulled the idiotic stunt of chugging the entire bottle.', 'She sniffles. “Look, Kat, you have to tell me what happened. I don’t, I can’t, I don’t remember everything. I mean, I remember sitting in the car with the beer, drinking it. And I remember starting to walk into the woods. That’s all.”', 'You draw in a long breath and look at Vanessa, finally. “Really? That’s all you remember?”', 'It’s Vanessa’s turn to look away. “Yeah. That’s all. So what did I do?”', '“Nothing,” you say, dizzy with relief. “Nothing bad. You just got drunk. Are you okay? Are you sick? You don’t look so good.” But you’re the one who’s shaking. The idiotic stunt could have—should have—broken everything wide open, but it didn’t. You got away with it. You vow to yourself, then and there, that you’ll never do anything like that again.', '\\xa0', 'At this meeting, as at every one you’ve ever been to, people talk about their blackouts with shame and terror: learning third-hand about humiliating scenes at parties, about insults shouted at soulmates and damage done to children who’ll be paying for a lifetime of therapy to get over it. Or not learning, never learning. Losing that time forever.', 'Most of Vanessa’s own blackouts appear to have been sordid messes filled with shattered dishes and anonymous sexual encounters. You know she picked up chlamydia and herpes during those adventures, and she told you once, with a sigh, that she can’t say for sure there was nothing anal.', 'But you also know she wants to forget most of the previous year, and you can tell, from how she’s staring at the clock, that she’d love to lose the three hours until her parole’s over. There’s a bar near the apartment. It’s open until two, which will leave plenty of time for disaster if she gets there at midnight.', 'A group from the meeting always goes out for coffee afterwards. Minta pressures Vanessa to come tonight, and you tell them you’re happy to tag along. “More fieldwork,” you tease Vanessa, but you and Minta both know it’s more than that. After all of you leave the diner, handling Van will be up to you. Minta, who’s a fierce and confrontational sponsor, is also a firm believer in the First Step. Ultimately, she’s powerless over Vanessa.', 'She’s told you that you are, too. She’s told you that you and Vanessa are badly codependent, that you need to get to meetings of your own. The meetings you really need, you can’t find.', '\\xa0', 'A few weeks after the beer incident, your health teacher begins a substance abuse unit. This is one of the few classes you share with Vanessa, because most of yours are Honors and none of hers are. “We’re going to talk about drinking today,” the teacher says, and everybody snickers. School drug education is completely lame, a set of horror stories in which people who party always wind up dying with their heads in toilets.', 'Vanessa, sitting across the room and trying to impress a football player, isn’t paying attention. You’re the only one who is. The teacher puts a list of alcoholism red flags up on the board. Family history. Craving. Drinking until you’re sick. Going to places where you know there will be booze. Blackouts.', 'Blackouts. Despite the unspoken rule of ignoring each other in this building, you glance at Vanessa. She’s looking back at you, wide-eyed. Maybe she’s recognized herself in this list. Maybe she’ll avoid beer from now on.', 'After class, Vanessa catches your eye again and ducks into a stairwell. You follow her. “Blackouts!” she says, and, “Alcoholism’s genetic! Kat, my parents? And the AAs? They were all just drunk! That’s why they have those memories of seeing weird shit and losing time. Aliens are their version of doing embarrassing things at parties! There aren’t any aliens at all!”', 'She’s desperate for any connection to her parents; you know that. But even for Vanessa, this is nuts. You shake your head. “Um, Van, have you ever seen your parents drink? Or any of those people? You’re the one who drinks.” And has blackouts, although that’s so obvious you don’t want to point it out.', '“Of course I haven’t seen them drink, but that’s the point! That’s why they don’t! What I thought was my parents’ joke about AA wasn’t really a joke at all! The other AA is where they should be, but it’s too embarrassing, so instead they invented the story about aliens and started their own group to stargaze, instead of doing whatever drunks do at those meetings.”', 'Vanessa clings to this theory for years, while you bury yourself in academic tomes about folklore. You develop your own ideas. You believe that changeling stories, all those tales about goblins and faeries left in cradles, about human babies spirited away and returned only years later if at all, are the earlier versions of alien abduction stories. Lost time. Elf Hill. Exotic beings with overly large eyes and pointed ears. Being returned to the wrong place with your clothing on backwards. People have been telling stories like that as long as there have been people.', 'You’re looking for your parents, too.', 'Vanessa scoffs at your theory as much as you scoff at hers. “Do changeling stories have anal probes?” She asks you this one summer evening when you’re both seventeen, sitting on the log in the forest while you watch Vanessa down a sixpack. You haven’t repeated your own mistake, but you come out here with her to keep an eye on her.', '“No anal probes. Sex, though. Tam Lin was basically a sex slave to the Queene of Faerie.”', '“I don’t believe in UFOs,” Vanessa says. Neither do you. You don’t believe aliens are coming back; you want to find aliens who are already here, passing. You gaze into the darkness between the trees, listening to the tiny night rustlings, yearning for kin.', 'Vanessa shakes her head. “Seriously, Kat? You don’t think that if there were green pointy-eared kids around, somebody would have noticed? Those stories are just how people explained kids who were born sick or disabled.”', '“They’d have to be able to blend in,” you say quietly.', '“Then how would you find them? Nah, it’s all nonsense. Everybody who went through that shit, with elves or grays or whatever, was just high. My parents must have been lushes in their youth and turned their blackouts into fairy tales; if you can’t remember, that means you were sucked up into a flying saucer and anal-probed. If they’d been born earlier, they would have been sucked into fairyland, and they’d be spending their time looking for crop circles and tromping around in the woods instead of gazing up at the sky. Either way, they won’t find anything.”', 'She’s slurring by now, badly. Alcohol’s a disinhibitor. Drinking usually makes Vanessa smarter, or anyway more willing to say smart things, until she falls off the cliff of incoherence. You’d tell her that the mere existence of the stories is its own evidence, but she becomes abruptly and violently ill, and when you get her back to the house she falls asleep, and the next morning she doesn’t remember the conversation.', '\\xa0', 'The after-meeting gang crowds into a diner booth and orders milkshakes and burgers and coffee. You buy Vanessa an ice cream sundae for her birthday, and she thanks you, but she barely touches it. She checks her watch every two seconds. People chat about their holiday plans, the nightmare of dealing with family, the stress of the first sober Christmas. You dig in your backpack for a legal pad and pretend to research a folklore paper. They’re all fascinated, flattered that you’re writing an ethnography of Twelve-Step culture. You tell them that you’re focusing on how they used drinking to fit in when they drank, and how they use the program to fit in now. You’re looking at definitions of belonging. What did that look like in childhood, and during the drinking years, and in sobriety?', 'Since AAs love nothing better than to talk about themselves, you get more material than you could possibly use even if this weren’t just a ruse to keep Vanessa in the diner. You scribble furious faux-notes as Vanessa takes slow, deliberate bites of her sundae and fidgets with her watch. She only snaps to attention, frowning, when one of the AAs—a thin brunette who teaches yoga—says, “My parents left me when I was a kid, and after that I never felt like I fit in anywhere.” There’s a collective sigh. Everyone, including you, can identify with that one.', '\\xa0', 'On Vanessa’s eighteenth birthday, you buy her dinner at a barbeque place in the city. She chows down on ribs; you, as usual, choke down a salad. You’re living in a tiny, decrepit loft, working at a graphic-design firm and taking online classes. Vanessa’s doing temp work and brooding about her latest boyfriend. You’re tired of listening to her obsess about him—he’s as much of a loser as all the others, and why can’t she see it?—so you try to distract her with stories about the jerks in your office and the tribal initiation rites you’re studying in your anthropology class. You have a complicated theory about how photocopying at work serves the same function as vision quests in certain Native American tribes, but Vanessa, who’s on her fourth beer, isn’t even pretending to follow this. After dinner, you take her to the Italian bakery across the street for dessert, and then you go home, claiming a work deadline instead of admitting that you can no longer stand to be around Van when she’s drunk. You know she plans to hook up with the boyfriend, a bouncer at an East Village club who ', ' likes her when she’s drunk.', 'She calls you the following afternoon, static crackling on the line from upstate, and tells you everything that’s happened. Over the years, she’ll retell the story obsessively, repeating it until it’s hardened into a translucent amulet, her identity in amber.', 'After you left, she called Tom but got only his answering machine. “I’m coming over,” she told him, and on the way she bought a quart of gin because she intended to get well and truly hammered in the company of somebody who’d drink with her. But he’d already started drinking with somebody else; when he answered the door, Vanessa saw the half-naked blonde behind him, and she cursed him and ran out of there.', 'And wound up on the street, on her birthday, with nothing to show for it but a bottle of gin and the aftertaste of cannoli, and it was dark and raining and she thought about finding a bar, but she was out of money and too tired for the buy-me-a-drink-for-sex hustle.', 'There was nowhere to go but home, so she did: dug out the return bus ticket she hadn’t planned to use until the next morning and headed ten blocks up, to the huge glass and steel bus station with its kiosks and filthy restrooms and bays full of humming behemoth vehicles, and got on one of them for the two-hour ride upstate. Her parents and the other AAs would be stargazing, even in the rain, but she was pretty sure they’d have left her a card and some cash, the standard birthday gift. She’d go up to her room. She’d listen to music and drink gin. Tomorrow she’d wake up with an awful hangover, but she’d have the birthday money. She’d figure something out. She’d find a new guy.', 'She went home. Nobody was there. They were undoubtedly stargazing at somebody else’s house. A card and a thick envelope sat on the kitchen counter—sometimes her parents gave her, like, a few hundred dollar bills—but she didn’t even touch them. She went upstairs and drank until she passed out.', 'The next morning, her parents still weren’t home, which was weird. Wearing her old plaid robe, Vanessa made herself coffee and, yawning, opened the card, a photo of some galaxy or other. Inside she saw her mother’s handwriting. “Goodbye sweet girl you are of age now and we are going home. Love.” They’d both signed it.', 'Goodbye? Vanessa squinted at it, blinked, and then reached for the fat envelope. The bills weren’t singles; they were hundreds. Her parents, she’d later learn, had left her the entire contents of their bank account.', 'She made phone calls. She interrogated the other AAs. Where were her parents? When were they coming back? She was met with gasps of awe. They’d finally done it! They’d finally ascended! They’d been talking about it, saying they thought it was close! “Oh honey,” said one woman, “they aren’t coming back. They’ve been picked up. They’ve been recovered. You should be excited for them.”', 'At which point, hysterical and ranting, she called you. “This can’t be happening!” You were glad that she was upstate, that she wasn’t in the same room, because you were nearly as upset as she was, and you couldn’t tell her why.', '“You’re right,” you said, your throat tight. “It can’t be happening. It’s nuts. You just have to look for them, Van.”', 'A few months later, the cops gave up. Vanessa hired private investigators, who also gave up. Her parents had never been smart enough to pull off a WITSEC-level disappearance.', 'Vanessa already felt abandoned by her parents, and when it was clear that they weren’t coming back, she set about filling the black hole of her life with booze. You, meanwhile, were going through your own agony, which you couldn’t share with Vanessa. You couldn’t share it with anyone at all.', 'The aliens had picked up Vanessa’s parents and left you here, again. Alone.', '\\xa0', 'The coffee-shop group finally disbands. It’s 11:00. Minta suggests a late movie, but Vanessa pleads headache and says she just wants to go home. “Don’t worry,” you tell Minta. “I’m not going to let her do anything dumb.”', 'You mean it.', 'Until that horrible night ten years ago, you hung out with Vanessa not just because she was the only other kid in your neighborhood, but because she, or rather her parents, might have helped you find your people. You have no idea why, aside from sheer habit, you’ve put up with her since then. If you ever went to a therapist—which you’ll never do—that would be your presenting issue.', 'You and Vanessa take the subway downtown. The closer you get to your stop, the twitchier she gets.', '“Van,” you say, over the rumble of the number 1 train, “You’re not going to do anything dumb. Right? You’re not going to throw away this entire year?”', 'She turns and glares at you. “This year? This year of feeling shitty and just wanting to drink and block everything out? This year of feeling like I don’t fit in anywhere, like you and Minta are watching everything I do and just waiting for me to screw up?”', 'She goes on like this for another minute or so. She’s on such a roll that you wonder if she’s already managed to sneak a drink. But you don’t smell it, and you can always smell it.', 'You wait for her to wind down, and then you say, “Van. Come on. You want to block everything out? You hate blackouts. You know you do.”', '“Yeah, well. Now I want them. The less I have to remember, the less it hurts.”', '“You hated being in jail. You hated being on probation.”', '“That won’t happen again.”', '“How do you know that? You can’t know that.”', 'Vanessa waves her hand dismissively; she can’t know, but she doesn’t care. She just wants to feel the booze sliding down her throat. She’s ruled by her craving. You know the feeling. There’s nothing you can say, and the train’s at your stop anyway. The two of you get out and trudge up the stairs, Vanessa a few feet ahead of you because she’s so much taller. You glance at your watch: 11:30.', 'In the apartment, you ease off your backpack as Vanessa hurls herself into her bedroom and slams the door. You hear her rattling through her closet, hear bureau drawers opening and closing. When she comes out again, she’s wearing a slinky red dress and high heels.', '“It’s 11:45,” she says. “It will take me five minutes to walk to the bar. So I guess I have to listen to you lecture me for another ten minutes, right?”', '“Right,” you say, and hold up the can of beer you’ve been lugging around in your backpack all day. Vanessa blinks, clearly startled. She forces a smile. You’re her surrogate parent now; she’s relying on you for the disapproval she could never get from her actual parents. You wonder why you’ve never realized this before.', 'She stares at the beer. “Is that for me, Kat?” Her voice is shaky. “You shouldn’t have.”', '“I didn’t,” you tell her, and pop the tab and down the can in one gulp, the same way you did on that night in the woods fourteen years ago. Vanessa gapes.', '“Kat?”', 'Alcohol’s a disinhibitor. You let go, unclench, and watch yourself reflected in the apartment windows. You’re seeing what she sees. Your limbs turn green and knobbed; your signature black cotton clothing distorts because now it’s draped over too many joints; your eyes expand, huge and faceted. That’s as far as it’s ever gone before, but tonight, hoping you’ll still be able to call it back, you let it go a little further. You grow mandibles. Your hands become claws.', '“You’re not drunk yet,” you tell her, forcing English words through this new anatomy. Each syllable blends with clicks and chirps. You hope she can understand you. “You’re really seeing this. It happened on your fourteenth birthday too, when I chugged that beer, and I was so relieved when you didn’t remember it, because I was afraid you’d hate me if I showed you that you were wrong about your parents. Aliens are real. I don’t know if I’m the same kind who picked them up. I don’t even know if that’s really what happened to them. But it’s certainly possible, okay? They weren’t telling those stories to hide drinking, and you don’t have to drink to feel connected to them.”', 'Vanessa, who sat down very suddenly on the couch at the beginning of this speech, whimpers. You take a step closer, every part of your body screaming in pain, yearning to transform further. You don’t let it.', 'This is the hardest thing you’ve ever done.', '“Now you know why I’m so fascinated by changeling stories. You think ', ' don’t fit in? Cry me a river. I’d give anything to have a group like you do. I’d give anything to be able to say, ‘My name’s Kat, and I’m an extraterrestrial who got left here by my parents and left behind again when they picked up my best friend’s parents and couldn’t bother with me.’ You think you’ve got abandonment issues, Vanessa? Get in line.”', 'You take another step, and Van shrinks into the back of the couch. “And you know why I’d love a group like that, aside from the fact that I’m horribly lonely? You know why I always eat salad and fucking protein powder even though they make me sick and I hate them? You know why they make me sick? They make me sick because you aren’t the ultimate carnivore, Vanessa. I am. I’ve wanted meat every second I’ve been aware, and not just any meat. Not cow meat. Human flesh. You. My parents must have loved me, because they left me somewhere with lots and lots of food. And the whole time you’ve known me, I’ve never let myself eat it.”', 'A third step. Vanessa’s eyes are almost as big as yours now. She fumbles in her bag for her phone, and you force yourself to start turning back. “Van,” you say, and she looks up. “Van, I’m changing back. I’m going to be the Kat you’ve always known. Don’t call anybody, okay? I’m not going to eat anybody, and I don’t want to be dissected. That’s why I never told your parents or the others what I was. I didn’t want them to worship me. I didn’t want them to put me in a lab. I didn’t want to eat them.”', 'She blinks. You force yourself back into fully human form, or as fully human as your form gets. You know she’ll never look at you the same way again. You know there’s no going back from what you’ve just done. You take a deep breath. “So, listen, you think you have trouble with your cravings? Well, so do I, and I have a lot less support than you do, and I’ve stayed vegan one lousy second at a time because I don’t want to hurt people who’ve tried to help me, because this is where I live. Okay? If I can stay abstinent, so can you. But if you drink, I will too. We both fall off the wagon together. Deal?” You see her swallow. “So do the right thing, Van, because now there’s a lot more at stake than your individual life. For all you know, you could be saving the entire planet.”', 'She nods jerkily. The beer’s churning in your stomach. “I have to throw up now,” you say. “Excuse me.” You run into the bathroom, certain that you’ll be left behind again, that Vanessa’s fled the apartment, that she’s calling someone even now—as you heave and puke—and that you’ll live the rest of your life, however long that is, as a science experiment.', 'But when you emerge from the bathroom, she’s waiting for you, standing with crossed arms, and once again you’re amazed by her courage. “You must have done it sometime,” she says. “Eaten, the, you know, meat. The whole time I’ve known you, you said, but you must have before that. Or you wouldn’t know. Would you?” Sometimes Van’s smart even when she’s not drunk. You look away, and she says, “Fair’s fair. You know everything about me.”', 'You stare out the window over her left shoulder. “The first pediatrician. And that foster mother. And the nurse in the room. Of course the exam turned up abnormalities, so I acted in self-defense. I was just a baby. It’s a pretty famous unsolved case: four people, three adults and an infant, missing from a clinic, never seen again. You can find it if you do an internet search.”', 'Vanessa shakes her head. “If you were just a baby, how—”', '“I grew. That’s what eating meat does. I was a baby and then after I ate I was what I am now, more or less. I haven’t changed much the whole time you’ve known me, right?” She shakes her head. “Yeah, so. I got into the hall—no one saw me leave the room—and then I just walked out of the building. I used the money from my foster mother’s wallet to hop a bus east.” You look back at her. “I have no idea what I’d turn into if I ate more.”', '“Vanished,” she says, her voice tight. “No bodies?” You can’t answer. All that blood and bone and flesh; you ate it all. Not a speck of any of those three people was left in the room. Vanessa shudders. “My parents vanished. Do you think—”', '“I don’t know,” you tell her, although you’ve thought about it. “I don’t think so, Van. I mean, they’d had some kind of contact before that, right? They knew it was coming. We don’t warn our meals.”', 'Vanessa lets out a long breath. After a moment she says, “Well, I hope you’re right, even though I figured they had to be dead.” And then, cautiously, “It wasn’t you, right?”', 'You recoil. “God no! No, Vanessa! I was the same before and after your parents disappeared, right? I’d have changed.”', 'She nods, seems to accept this. “Do you think they came in a spaceship, or—”', '“I don’t know. I figure if it or they were still here, if they were meat-eaters like me, we’d have heard a bunch of horror stories. More missing people. So maybe a spaceship, if they were meat-eaters. Either way, they wanted nothing to do with me.”', '“Shit,” Vanessa says. “That hurts. I’m sorry.”', '“I’m not. I mean, I kind of am. I was. But now I’m glad. Because I like people.” You’re embarrassed, but it’s true. Those sincere alkies at the meeting, the geeky students in your classes, the checker at the grocery store who frets over how thin you are and keeps asking you whether you have a warm winter coat. Vanessa. “It sounds corny, but I love you guys. I don’t want to eat any of you. I just want to go native, even if I have to live on salad and throw up all the time. I just want to belong.”', 'You realize, right then, why you still hang out with Vanessa. You want to save someone, to be the hero instead of the monster. And maybe you want to give her the chance to be a hero, too. You swallow. “You’ll help me, right?”', 'A tear slides down her cheek. “Hell, Kat. I’ve never helped anybody. But I will if I can.”', '\\xa0', 'That was years ago. So far, both of you have kept your promises, one lousy second at a time.', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Susan Palwick', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Jasu Hu']}\n"

The black sand beach was soft to the feet, containing the right amount of exquisitely shaped shells planted in a manner that drew Jared down the beach, exploring. Lake had brought her son here because of the nature setting. He seemed to be enjoying himself, yet she watched with a wary eye, jaw and shoulders tight with anxiety. Her eyes darted restlessly to the endless scroll of must-haves to the right of her main view: spa getaways, mood boosters (completely safe!), and the latest fashions. At the upper right of her view were the icons for her own settings, as well as the parental access to her son’s space. Knowing she could always check his whereabouts should be reassuring, but it couldn’t warn her in advance, and that was the issue.', 'A small group had gathered a short distance away: two young men, three women in burkinis, and four children, all apparently older than Jared. Lake reached for her cover-up and slipped it over her head. She knew it wasn’t necessary, but still, the modesty wear made her self-conscious. Instantly, burkinis began scrolling through her feed, informing her brightly that ', ' She almost laughed.', 'One of the older girls, wearing a purple and black burkini, spotted Jared and ran up to him. They exchanged words, and then the girl threw back her head and laughed. Jared flung out his arms, theatrically, like his father used to when he was about to accomplish some minor feat like opening a stubborn jam jar. These small reminders always stabbed Lake with sweet daggers.', 'Having broadcast his intentions for greatness, Jared turned and did a cartwheel in the sand. His new friend clapped, and then did a handstand while Jared stared. The girl lowered expertly onto her feet again, and then gestured for Jared to try it. It took him a few tries to get his feet up high enough for her to catch them and help him balance.', 'Lake looked over at the rest of the group. Two of the women were watching the acrobatics, and one looked over at her and waved. Lake waved back. She dared to hope she could leave Jared with them while she went to her job. Even an hour in beta testing would earn her enough money to keep them both going for several more days. Only a small percentage of the fully instantiated opted for that type of work, and never the sequestered, until she’d come around. Most people didn’t want to be reminded of where they were. It ', ' disorienting, but it paid well, and expenses here were minimal. Maybe Lake could sweeten the pot by offering the girl credits for babysitting.', 'All the children were at the shore now, playing. They’d made their way closer to where Lake sat. She waved at the girl who’d helped Jared with his handstand. The girl smiled and returned the gesture shyly. She had such a pretty smile.', 'Jared tapped his new friend on her arm to regain her attention. “Hey, look, Aminah! Look what else I can do!” His form suddenly slumped.', '. Lake sprang to her feet in alarm, but it was too late. Jared deflated like a popped balloon and then he was gone.', 'The girl gasped, and then stared wide-eyed at Lake.', 'Lake’s face grew hot with embarrassment. “I’m so sorry,” she shouted, to be heard above the waves. “He’s only eight. He…thinks it’s funny.”', 'But Aminah had started to back away. “Oh. That’s okay. Bye!” She took off running, and the other children followed. Lake watched as Aminah spoke to one of the women, and then pointed at Lake. The other children kept running down the beach, increasing their distance.', 'So much for the idea of babysitting. Lake burst into tears, which she quickly quelled. She closed her eyes and concentrated. ', ' she told herself. ', '.', '\\xa0', 'She succeeded. The physical clapping brought her into awareness of her body. She sat up, fumbled with her hood and pulled it off. The bed ceased undulating. She blinked repeatedly as her eyes adjusted to the soft security lighting. There were no windows here, only undecorated cream-colored walls and the long rows of black-clad forms on their beds. The place reeked of body odors and cleaning fluid. She yanked the tubes out of her suit and swung her heavy legs over the side of the bed. It was becoming easier to do this, and that was a bad sign. She pounded the bed with her fist, and then, leaving her hood behind, rose and stumbled down the long rows of anonymous black-clad near-corpses. She should be like them, learning to forget their bodies, not feeling the slick coolness of the laminate floor through the thin soles of her suit as she chased down her wayward child.', 'The door at the end of the room swept open as she approached. She stepped into the softly lit hallway, and across to the children’s ward.', 'The door opened at the touch of her palm scan. Everything here was the same as the other room, but in miniature. Something tugged at her heart at the sight of all the small, still bodies. She’d been told they took better to the transition than adults. Their entire brief lives had led them to this.', 'She knew where to look, and saw the empty bed. “Jared?” She cleared her throat, and tried a little louder. “Jared!”', 'Flashing lights warned her she’d exceeded the policy’s decibel limits. “Sorry,” she murmured, and exited quickly, her heart pounding with mounting panic. She stood in the corridor looking up and down, not knowing which way to go. She tried taking deeper, slower breaths. She had to calm herself so she could think, and act.', 'She’d seen him disappear twice before, in the ten days they’d been here, but she’d always found him in the ward, wandering up and down the rows of kids. “I wanted a glass of water,” he’d said the first time. Honey, she’d reminded him, you can drink all the water you want if you put your hood back on. He hadn’t seemed to hear her. He’d stared at the rest of kids on their beds and whispered, “Everyone looks weird, don’t they? It’s kind of spooky.”', 'The second time, he’d complained his suit itched, and his face was hot under the hood. “Can I go outside for some air?” he’d asked innocently. “It stinks in here.”', 'Now he was gone. Honestly, why did the ward allow a child out to wander around? “Jared!” The lights flashed again. Really? She was out in the hall. If they’d wanted to, they could’ve provided some soundproofing, or stuffed everyone’s ears with plugs or something. They could’ve done that.', 'Somewhere down the corridor, she heard a door closing. She burst into a mad sprint, ignoring her tortured lungs gasping for air almost immediately. She was quickly getting out of shape, being here. But of course she wasn’t supposed to be ', '. And neither was Jared.', 'She spotted the soft green light of an exit, its white figure in mid-stride, dutifully following the pointing arrow. She yanked open the door. There were stairs going up, and none going down. They were being kept in a basement? She was so disgusted she felt sick to her stomach. “Jared!” she called up the stairwell.', 'The silence gnawed at her gut. She hadn’t seen one person, not one robot, either. Clearly, this place was understaffed. Those flashing lights were on automatic sensors.', 'Somewhere above, a heavy door slammed, followed by a whirring noise that grew closer. Then she heard quiet sobbing. “I just wanted some air!”', '“Jared!”', '“Jared is found,” a calm male voice announced.', 'They came into view, a robot in descent mode with gliders extended, cradling the limp form of her son in its outstretched arms. Jared’s suit was made to leave his artificial legs uncovered, and they gleamed as they dangled, the same dark metal as the robot’s.', '“Jared!” Her voice was stuck on that one word, but this time she uttered it with relief.', 'His head lolled toward her. “Mom?” His eyes struggled to focus as they reached the bottom step.', 'She rushed forward, tried to take him from the robot’s hands. “What’s wrong with him?”', 'The robot either didn’t understand she wanted to take him, or refused her wishes. “Jared is fine. A mild sedative has been administered. It was understood you wanted him returned, Ms. Lake Lipsman. You are his legal guardian.”', '“I’m his mother,” she retorted.', 'The robot did not reply. Its gliders retracted, and it skated swiftly past her and down the hall toward the children’s ward. Lake followed. She moved as fast as she could, but there was no keeping up with the thing.', 'The robot was already pulling Jared’s hood on when she arrived at the door to the children’s ward, out of breath. She wished she could’ve seen her son’s face one last time.', '“Do you wish there to be a child lock on the hood?” the robot asked softly as it finished its ministrations.', 'Her mouth was suddenly dry. “Child lock? I thought that was for the younger kids. You know, the ones too little to understand.” She took several steps toward Jared’s still form. “Why don’t you just keep him in the ward if he comes out again?”', 'The robot finished hooking Jared’s tubes up, and turned toward her. “This is Sequester. It is not a prison.”', 'Lake sucked in her breath. At last she said, “No hood lock on my son. Understand? I’ll keep him inside. He’ll adjust.”', 'The robot glided to the door, gesturing for her to follow. “They nearly always do.”', 'The door to the children’s ward slid closed behind her. Nearly always?', 'The door to the adult ward whispered open. “Would you like assistance with your own bed?” asked the robot.', 'She stomped past. “No. Just give me my son’s coordinates.”', '“Gladly. You’ll be surfacing at your dwelling. He’ll be waking up.”', '\\xa0', 'She watched Jared’s eyes flutter open. “Hi, honey! Did you have a nice nap?”', 'He raised himself onto his elbows and looked around, frowning. “Mom. I’m not four years old. I know what went down.”', 'Lake dropped her forced smile. “Fine. So you don’t want to be treated like a baby? Then let me tell you something. I’ve worked very, very hard so I can give you this. Don’t you like having your own room? Getting to play on a black sand beach? Don’t you like having your own legs?”', 'Jared frowned and pushed himself upright and out of bed, jostling Lake’s shoulder. “That’s ableist talk, mom. I ', ' legs.” He left the room.', 'Where had he heard that term? Surely not in his present school. School before, then. Or from his father. She heaved a sigh. She had sacrificed a lot, working overtime, so he could have those legs. They had to change them as he grew, too. He’d been on his third set when they’d come to Sequester.', 'Her feed scrolled through other apartments she could have, other beaches to visit. ', ' She saw a breathtaking view from a high vantage point.', '“Hey,” she called out. “How about we take a trip to the mountains? Do some hiking?”', 'His head popped into sight in the doorway. “Mom. Is that what your feed is showing now?”', 'She threw up her hands. “I’m just trying to make you happy. So what do ', ' want to do? Tell me and we’ll do it.”', 'He slouched against the door frame and studied his shoes. “Well, we’ve been studying animals at school. Dogs and things. I guess I could go do that, and then hang out with some of the kids.”', 'Lake rose and went to him. She bent and kissed the top of his head and then ruffled his hair. “You’ve been making friends, then. That’s good.” Maybe that’ll keep him where he’s supposed to be. Age groups were more often separated here. It encouraged the children to become more autonomous, while providing a safe environment, reducing the need for constant parental monitoring. Lake had been enjoying her own greater freedom, until her son had started disappearing.', 'Having him in school also meant she could go to work. “Hey, so get out of here already. I’ll see you later.”', '“Thanks, Mom.” Jared straightened and headed for the living room and the front door.', '“And Jared?”', '“Yes, Mom?”', '“Behave yourself now.”', '“Sure, Mom.” Then he was out the door.', '\\xa0', 'Lake suspected that aside from being disorienting, people shied away from beta testing because it requires interaction with artificial intelligence. The A.I. were difficult to understand, even when they managed a complete sentence in human language. Usually they spoke in gibberish, which she’d been told was their own invented language, and signified their superior intelligence.', ', one said.', 'Another responded in a more feminine voice. ', 'It didn’t seem important whether she understood or not. They seemed to listen politely to her verbal feedback after testing, but she suspected it was unnecessary. They’d probably already gathered what they’d needed based on observing her.', 'Sometimes what she beta tested was unpleasant, although afterward she felt invigorated by being stretched and challenged in this way. Today was no exception. She found herself in a different body, one with extra appendages she didn’t seem able to control. They flopped around as she walked, even slapping her in the face. She became aware she was on a very thin slice of sidewalk suspended high over a mountain valley. Even though she knew she was safe, she gasped, and her four arms flailed. The two arms she seemed unable to control slapped against her face again. It didn’t hurt—nothing here ever did—but it was annoying. She strained with the effort of trying to manipulate them, to no avail. They fumbled over her face till they found her eyes, and covered them. Evidently this was their function, because they stopped flopping around. What a relief.', 'Then the feed sprang to life around her. No longer was it a separate window to the side of her vision. It enveloped her. She had a new avatar here. It was younger, more vibrant, and thankfully had the correct number of arms and legs. Delighted, she grabbed at things. She tried on a flowing halter dress that shimmered with color when she moved. She selected a pair of gold stiletto heels she’d never been able to walk in with her other body, but was effortless here. She saw a section where she could modify this new avatar. She could select different eyes, give herself a nose job (she laughed ruefully at that one), or sculpt her body in new ways. Suddenly she had a tiny waist, and slimmer thighs. Her skin looked like she’d spent a week in the Bahamas.', 'She found she could focus outside this immersive feed experience. She experimented with her new appendages again, and found at last the trick to thinking about them, and with this thought muscle she uncovered her eyes. Looking down, she saw she did not have the new body or the new clothes. “Well, that sucks,” she said out loud. Back on the thin walkway above the abyss, she was suddenly overcome by a feeling of deep loss, and sank to her knees. Her whole life had been a series of disappointments. Jared’s father, David, had left her for a man. She’d understood, but she’d also lost her best friend. Then Jared was diagnosed—incompetent doctors for not catching that sooner!—and had his legs amputated when he was four years old.', 'She looked down into the abyss. It would be easy to throw herself off, but she knew she couldn’t die here. Instead, she tried covering her eyes with her hands again. Wrong pair. She tried again, with the other hands that she was still getting used to manipulating, and covered her eyes with those.', 'Instead of seeing the beautiful feed sprung to life, with the customizable body and all those clothes, she was out of the simulation altogether.', ', said the more feminine voice.', 'Was that a reference to a slot machine? Lake almost laughed. She started to report out, sharing her impressions and thoughts—especially about that new way to experience the feed!—but she was suddenly very tired. They probably knew everything they needed to, anyway. She punched out for home.', '\\xa0', 'Lake paced the living room, frowning. She’d rather be at the Never-Ending Mixer, her favorite after-work hangout, but she’d told Jared she’d be here when he came home. But just when was that going to be? She replayed the memory of their conversation, and saw no time had been mentioned. He’d said he was going to hang out with the kids after classes, so even if she checked the school times, it wouldn’t tell her anything about Jared’s return.', 'She replayed the memory again. There was her son, leaning on the door jamb, studying his shoes. That was his father’s slouch, with the downward gaze. She pursed her lips. Jared’s intentions were plain as day, but she’d failed to see it because she’d been so relieved she could go to work. If you passed a statue in an art museum posed like this, its title would read ', '.', 'Oh, but she knew exactly where he was. She flung herself on the couch and closed her eyes. ', ', she shouted at herself. That wouldn’t do. She sighed out a lungful of anger and tried again. ', '\\xa0', 'She sat up, pulling the hood from her head in one smooth motion, and then the lines connecting her suit with the bed. God, she was getting too good at coming out. She was steady on her feet as she rose and walked swiftly to the door of the ward.', 'There was a robot in the hallway, apparently waiting for her. For a moment, she took it for the one that had brought Jared back from wherever he’d roamed, but then again, all of them looked alike. Robot personality programming had been purged several updates ago.', '“Where is he?” she demanded.', 'The robot tilted its head as if unsure what she’d said. “This is your formal warning that repeated surfacing behavior will result in ejection from Sequester.”', 'Lake sucked in her breath. “Just how many formal warnings do I get?”', '“One,” the robot replied.', 'Lake blinked. “This one? This is it?”', '“Correct.”', 'Lake’s hands clenched. “Then help me find my fucking son.”', 'She pushed past the robot and let herself into the children’s ward. All the bodies looked so similar in their black suits, but at least none of the beds were empty. She breathed a sigh of relief when she spotted Jared’s artificial legs, gleaming in the dim light. She approached, and stared down at his form, suddenly wanting to scream at him, he’s caused them both so much trouble. They’re on the brink of being evicted, of losing this golden opportunity to improve their lives for good.', 'But he was already on the other side, back where he should be in the virtual world. She’d have to save her fury for when she returned.', 'She felt rather than heard the robot’s presence at her side. There was a displacement of the air, a large mass in her peripheral vision. Her memory worked the old way here, but it was vivid enough.', '“You mentioned you could put on a child lock,” she said. “On his hood. So he can’t take it off.”', '“It requires the legal guardian of the child to authorize,” it said.', 'She chewed her lower lip briefly. “Then let’s do it.”', 'The robot reached down. Its arm made two clamping motions, one on each side of Jared’s neck.', '“And take his legs,” she said, turning away.', '“Repeat?”', '“You heard me. Take his goddam legs off.” She exited, crossed the hall swiftly, and reentered her own ward.', 'It’s for his own good, she told herself as she fastened herself into the bed. He’ll be fine. He’ll adjust. Everyone does. And he’ll thank me. He’ll thank me for this.', '\\xa0', 'She sat in her beach chair, toes grinding into the black sand, and watched her son—her only son—stare out to sea. He hadn’t spoken to her for three hours, not since he’d obviously tried to leave, to come out of it, to do his little visit back to his body. He’d come bursting out of his room screaming, “Mom! What’s going on?” She’d tried to soothe him, of course. She wasn’t a monster. She was doing this because she loved him.', '“Honey,” she’d said as she held him close. “It’s because I care about you. I care about your future. You’ve got to believe me, this is better than out there. You’ll live forever, for one.”', 'Then, because he hadn’t stopped crying, she’d brought him here, to the beach. He liked the beach. Kids don’t understand about mortality, she thought. Jared probably never thought she’d die someday, let alone himself.', 'Jared was planted in the wet sand, letting gentle waves roll over his legs. His father, David, had liked the beach. He was always photographing the beach, and their seaside cottage, with that impossibly archaic camera with the bellows, and gargantuan negatives. He had to send for supplies halfway across the country, to make his blasted black-and-white photographs.', '“Why do you bother?” she’d asked him many times.', '“I like old things,” he’d responded. But there were some things he liked young, she’d discovered. He’d left her for a twenty-five-year-old man who’d majored in psychology at Sarah Lawrence. They got the beach cottage in the divorce. Lake had taken the two-bedroom apartment in Cambridge, near Jared’s school.', 'The morning she’d left him with Jared in tow, David had stood staring at the sea in the same way that Jared stared now.', 'She reached up and ran her fingers over her hair, as if the memories would shake out with the sand and float down the shore. This programmed place she’d secured for herself, for Jared, was her new world now, an exciting and seemingly limitless place that she was helping to create with A.I., through her beta testing job. Cherry cherry lime, they’d told her. They’d been pleased. When would she be able to leave Jared again and go back to work? She’d love to be enveloped by the feed again. The current sidebar of goodies suddenly seemed outdated. She watched the offerings scroll by: mood boosters, a memory excision tool. She paused to read about the latter.', '“Mom? Mom!”', 'It was Jared, kneeling in front of her. Black sand stuck to his arms and thighs like so much pepper.', '“Yes, I’m here,” she said. “You don’t have to shout.”', '“Mom, I have to go back. Now.”', '“Jared, you know you can’t. It’d mean—”', '“I have to feed the dog, Mom. It’ll starve if I don’t.”', '“Dog?” She couldn’t process this. “We can get you a dog, honey. Whatever you want.”', '“Mom. This is a real dog. There’s a place outside Sequester where I go. Mom.” He started to cry.', '“Go? What do you mean go?” But now guilt stabbed through the anger and made everything clear. She’d been so wrapped up in her new job, and being around A.I., and going to the Never-Ending Mixer, and worrying about what he was ', ' to do, that she’d neglected to access her son’s space to look at his history of movements. She called it up now, even as he relentlessly stared at her with those serious eyes. And what she saw was unbelievable.', '“You’ve hardly been sequestering at all,” she whispered. Every time she’d been at work, every time she’d gone to the Never-Ending Mixer, he’d been sneaking out. He’d hardly attended school at all, since they’d arrived.', '“How can you still be here?” She meant how was he not expelled from Sequester, but instead it sounded like she didn’t want him around. Yet she didn’t have the words to correct herself. The silence between them was an almost measureable distance.', '“They’ve been letting me go outside to get fresh air,” he said. “It’s only when you get involved that they care. Mom, please. I need to go.”', 'God, that place was so lax, that they wouldn’t even protect a child.', '“I’ll buy you a pet.” God, she was shouting. She wasn’t angry at Jared, but the system. It was seriously messed up. There should be a warning light on that parental access icon, to let someone know they should be monitoring their child’s activities.', 'He leaped to his feet and glowered down at her. “I don’t want a fake dog!”', 'Lake made an effort to lower her voice. “Honey, I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you.”', 'But he was screaming now. “I can’t believe you put a lock on my hood!”', '“Jared.” She was calm now. She had this. “They weren’t doing you any favors, letting you go outside. The whole point of Sequester is to weaken your attachment to your body. So you can adjust to being here permanently.”', 'His brows drew together. If he’d been older, he’d look menacing. “I don’t want to be here. I want to stay a breather.”', 'Lake stared up at him. “I’m not sure you understand what that means, honey. You’re too young to think long-term.”', 'His expression had gone blank. He was reading his feed. She hoped he was looking at the dogs he could have, but she doubted it.', '“Mom?” His voice was a whisper. “Did you tell them to take…my legs?”', 'Again the guilt threatened to overwhelm her, just as it had with his father. Why hadn’t she seen that one coming, either? It had only been when her heart had broken that she’d seen the truth, could trace the history of the betrayal. She lifted her chin. “I did. For your own good. Honey, I love you. You need to let me provide for you.”', 'He was backing away from her across the sand. Then he exited the beach. Lake flipped on her parental access. She’d never neglect that again.', 'She saw at least he wasn’t trying to surface, to claw at his hood. But where he’d gone was puzzling. What was he doing at Human Affairs? Well, let him learn for himself that she was well within her rights to make decisions for him.', 'She rose, brushing sand from her thighs absentmindedly. While he was occupied, she could go to work.', '\\xa0', 'She was special. She’d known that by the assignments they’d given her, but it was all confirmed at the Never-Ending Mixer. She arrived after work, when another invigorating round of what she’d begun to call feed immersion helped her recover from her argument with Jared. She dropped the term casually at the mixer—the first time she’d mentioned her job—and instantly found herself the center of a small crowd’s admiration.', 'You’re still in Sequester, and you’re beta testing?', 'Yes, she was, she said proudly.', 'But you’re so new to the virtual world. You can’t possibly have adjusted to standard functioning yet.', 'She was used to having a job. There happened to be openings for beta testing, she’d signed up, and was accepted. It pays well.', 'It carries a certain amount of risk. Adjustment problems, primarily, which places a strain on one’s mental health.', 'Actually, she found the work interesting.', 'Then came a barrage of questions about A.I. She could answer few of these, but it was obvious they were jealous of her interactions with artificial intelligence. The crowd was hungry for any tidbit of information. She got the distinct impression she was viewed as a courageous pioneer. Well, she’d had to be that, and resourceful as well, as a single parent. Providing for her son had made her tenacious. Bringing Jared here was part of her natural pioneering spirit. This was the wave of the future.', 'She was still having fun at the mixer, regaling the crowd with some of her testing experiences, when she received a message in her feed. She was being summoned to Human Affairs. She sighed. Undoubtedly she was being asked to retrieve Jared. She didn’t want to leave. Everyone was absolutely spellbound. Well, it was a sneak preview of their future, after all. But being a parent came first. She left right away, voicing sincere apologies to her admirers.', '\\xa0', 'Jared’s shoulders were hunched, and his gaze was on his shoes as he stood next to the arbitrator, a tall woman with extremely short gray hair and wearing a blush pink blouse over gray trousers. The pink looked decidedly unjudicial. When the arbitrator spoke, she sounded too informal.', '“Hi, Lake,” she said. “We’re here to talk about Jared’s request to be emancipated from you. If granted, your parental rights will be terminated.”', 'She did not have words for this…betrayal. Jared was just like his father. “There must be some mistake,” she told the arbitrator.', 'The woman’s eyes were not unkind. “Please answer this question, Lake. Did you order the robot to remove your son’s prosthetic legs?”', 'Something deep inside her ached, threatened to overwhelm. She was going to buy that memory excision tool she’d seen in her feed. “I did. The stakes were high. We were close to being expelled from Sequester.”', 'The arbitrator regarded her, inhaling slowly. “And you ordered this, aware that Jared’s prosthetics are fully integrated into his body? That they aren’t readily removable?”', '“Of course,” Lake replied, irritated. Only the best for her son. This wasn’t the olden days, when people took their artificial limbs off to go to bed.', 'The arbitrator blinked once, quickly. “Are you aware your request in this matter was denied?”', 'Lake was taken off guard. “No. I mean…I was…” She didn’t want to admit she’d given the order out of anger. She’d only wanted to make sure Jared stayed put. For his own good.', 'The arbitrator cut into her thoughts. “Your order was denied because it was a reckless request. Sequester is not a prison.”', 'The robot had said the same thing. Lake was fuming inside. They let her son get up and leave Sequester multiple times, for hours. But one careless comment from her, uttered when she was justifiably angry and fearful of the consequences, and it was grounds for this? Well, she wasn’t about to blow up now. She stood, seething, facing the arbitrator and her son, and said nothing.', 'The arbitrator paused, and then nodded. “Because Human Affairs has jurisdiction over these matters, and they’ve given me authority to make a decision on this, I’m declaring Jared emancipated from your authority. Is there anything you’d like to say to Jared, or to me, at this time, Lake?”', 'Lake shook her head, not to mean no, but to express her disbelief. “Where is he going to go? Who’s going to take care of him?”', 'The arbitrator put a hand on Jared’s shoulder and he looked up, grudgingly, into his mother’s eyes. “I’ve talked to Dad.”', 'Lake’s shoulders stiffened.', 'The arbitrator spoke to Jared. “Your dad. You want to go live with your dad.”', 'Jared nodded. “He’ll come get me tomorrow. And Hope, too.”', '“Hope?” Lake echoed. The word didn’t belong here. “Hope for what?”', 'Jared smiled sheepishly. “Hope is the name of my dog, Mom.”', 'Again that dog. She accessed her son’s space—she still had her authority to do that— and clicked to access his memories.', 'She—in Jared’s point of view—bounded up the stairs and out a gray utility door. There was a stark contrast of bright sun and deep shadow that she recognized as late afternoon. She looked left, then right, along the deserted side street, little more than an alley, really. Then she darted across the street and into the back of a place.', 'Inside she emerged into a small grocery, a mini-mart. It was deserted, but there were still a few cans and boxes on the shelves. There was a shadow under the front window that moved. It was a black dog wagging its tail slowly. It was lying on several thicknesses of old blankets. It leaned heavily on its front legs as it stood. It approached with a hobbling gait, and Lake soon realized why. The dang thing was missing a right hind leg.', 'She watched Jared’s hand go out and pet the dog’s head. ', 'The dog wagged its tail in reply, and followed Jared around the corner of an aisle, where a food and water dish stood up against a darkened refrigerator case that still contained a few bottles of water and soda. The crude simplicity of the scene, and the fragility of biological life, touched her.', 'There were tears rolling down her cheeks as she withdrew from the memory. She understood now why Jared was drawn to that pitiful dog. There was something in him that was like his mother, after all: a headstrong determination to provide for another being’s needs, even if it meant self-sacrifice.', 'Her son and the arbitrator were looking at her. She needed to say something. “Fine. Go.”', 'Jared ran to her and encircled her torso with his arms, putting his face alongside her neck. She closed her eyes and thought about the beach: the sun on her face, and the wind gently playing with her hair.', 'It was she who broke the embrace at last, prying his hands from around her. “So go feed your dog.”', 'His lips quivered as he smiled. His eyes glistened with tears of his own. “Thanks, Mom.”', 'Lake wanted to say the dog looked like a good one. She wanted to say something encouraging. But she couldn’t. She was reliving the challenges of dealing with all those physical things out there. Buying food. Making meals. Taking showers. Needing a car to drive yourself to work. Shoveling snow. Dusting. Laundry. Calling someone to come fix stuff when it breaks down. God, and the body breaking down. Surely Jared would come to understand mortality when he was older, would come back to Sequester. Everyone would come here, eventually, who could afford it.', 'Jared reached up and put both hands on her shoulders. It broke her reverie, and she looked down into a pair of sincere eyes. “Bye, Mom. I know you’ll be happy here. I know how much you like it.”', 'Then he was gone. His virtual form didn’t deflate as before, but simply winked out, like it was no big deal. It was hard to believe he was gone for good. She was seized with the desire to clap her hands, go to him, just to say goodbye again, in her old body, one human to another. But to do so would kick her out of the garden of paradise.', 'She left Human Affairs and went to the beach, where she bought a mood booster and looked out at the waves rolling in. Up the beach a ways there were several women in burkinis, and children running along the beach. She thought they might be the same Muslim family, the girl Aminah among them, who had helped Jared do a handstand. Lake waved, feeling the freedom in her arm, light as the breeze. She could go to her beta testing job now, and work as long as she liked.', 'She bought the memory excision tool, and carved away the worst about David and Jared, leaving just enough of the pain so she wouldn’t miss them. Then she went into her settings and deselected her feeding functions. She may as well speed things up.', 'She received a message a few days later that her body had been vacated and cremated. There was no going back now. She was fully instantiated. What a relief, she told herself.', 'David and Jared could reach her through the interface, but the outside world operated at a much slower pace. By the time they initiated messaging through the interface, they’d be old as history to her.', 'In the meantime, she’d made it. She was in the better world for good.', 'Text copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Lettie Prell', '\\nArt copyright\\xa0© 2018 by Mary Haasdyk']}\n"

Duke Michal, Regent to the Throne is his official title, but the hand-drawn postered sheets, the words whispered in back alleys all nickname him the same. She smiles warmly at the assembled guests, standing poised and waiting by their chairs, ready for the confections and amuse-bouches that have been a mainstay of the high table for the last year.', 'Saffron has been Confection Taster all that time, her husband Danny Head Pastry Chef. Their warm smiles have been perfected as the Traitor King’s power grows, inch by inch, as those who object to his grasp fail and fall, as the printers are vanished, as the daughters disappear from their homes. The little prince still sleeps in his nursery—but for how long? That is the question on everyone’s mind in the last year. Not a question uttered, but a question that stays poised on the tongue, and does not fall.', 'The Traitor King takes his place. He looks sternly around the table, watching to see if anyone dares sit or talk or breathe before him. Then he breaks into a jovial smile, and everyone exhales, and there is careful laughter: the Duke is in a good mood tonight. There will be candies and conversations, alliances formed and favors exchanged, perhaps a juggler hung for dropping the pins, but who minds the jugglers?', 'Saffron minds. She minds very much.', ' bids the Duke, and around the table the white-coated servants set down the gilded plates, each bearing the first bite-sized course, showcasing Danny’s skill. An identical plate is set next to Saffron, the Duke’s own plate, this one bearing a pastry twice as large as the others, so the Duke shall not lose any of the delight of his food to caution.', 'The Duke barely flicks his eyes Saffron’s direction. She knows what to do, and smiling, she cracks the thin toast in two with her fine silver fork, and takes her bite.', '\\xa0', 'Saffron knows this moment instantly. The angled sun falls in clean lines on the bakery floor. ', ' is the name on the hand-carved sign of the shop, for it is an ordinary bakery still. A younger Danny stands at the counter, just turning with flour-dusted chin to notice her. She has come here so often with the rosemary crostini that she has what the lords and ladies do not: an instant of double-memory, of twinned lives, as she breathes, and lets herself go, and tumbles five years into the past.', 'Her sister Rosie pushes her forward, hisses, “Your turn,” in teasing tones, and Danny and Saffron’s eyes lock.', 'Saffron swallows. Two girls on a rare free afternoon, on a mission to see who can charm the most treats out of willing young shopkeepers and clerks. Rosie is the younger by a year but the older in daring. Her funny, loyal sister has transformed this morning into a different girl, all curls and honeyed tones, a girl on a mission. So far she has acquired: Item (1) length of green velvet ribbon, long enough to tie back her gold-brown hair. Item (1) scrap of lace, to finish the wrists of the gloves she is making for Saffron. Surely Saffron could manage a chocolate, a tartlet, a bun?', 'And yet here she is, with the sinking feeling that she ', '.', 'The kind-eyed young man—for now she no longer knows his name, she has the faint feeling that she has forgotten, there is something teasing at the back of her mind—well, he leans on the scarred wood counter and asks again if he can help.', '“A. . .a rye bun, please,” she says at random.', '“Just one then?” he says with amusement, and he reaches for it. The young man, so quiet on other occasions Saffron has come in, seems rather more self-possessed today, but who would not be at a girl stammering “bun”?', '“Yes. No.” She can’t remember anything Rosie did to charm that ribbon off of the shopkeeper; all her wits have fled. “I mean, I may have forgotten my coins?”', '“It’s a fine day when a beautiful girl comes into my grandfather’s bakery with no money, but only wants one poor little rye bun,” he says. “Hardly seems worthwhile to charge her.” She flushes; he understands the game and is teasing her.', 'Rosie elbows her; she should make her move. Say something pert in response; acquire the prize. Her coin is her flirtation, her smiles, she sees now that she and Rosie are paying after all, in a different kind.', 'But instead, behind the baker she sees a small waif, silhouetted in the back door to the shop. Saffron nods at the baker, points over his shoulder. “Do you have company?”', 'He turns, drops his teasing manner. “Jacky,” he says affectionately, and scoops several buns and a long thin loaf off of a different shelf. The small creature holds open his bag hopefully, and the day-old bread is placed inside. Jacky pulls out a single copper cent and gravely hands it to the baker, who as gravely accepts it. “My best to your mother,” the baker says, as the waif scampers off.', 'The young man turns back to the counter, and the kindness in his eyes is replaced by a different kind of warmth for Saffron, one that is gentle and interested, and possibly could be the same kind of warmth as for that little boy someday if she lets it, if she begins as she means to go on.', 'Saffron puts the coins on the counter for the rye bun. “Will you have coffee with me?” she says, clearly and calmly and forthrightly.', 'The flour-dusted young man takes her money and hands her the bun. Rosie snickers in the background, but the baker’s smiles are all for her. “Aye, and more.”', '\\xa0', 'Saffron returns to herself, the delight of the memory still sharp on her tongue. Her eyes clear, she smiles warmly at the crowd. “This has always been one of my favorite recipes of Danny’s,” she tells them, and her gilded plate is passed to the Duke. He does not look at her as he picks up the second bite of golden-crusted toast, redolent with rosemary and crystals of sea salt. Danny was an excellent baker long before he started experimenting with the rose-thyme plant that causes the memories, and this crostini is no exception.', 'Around the table the noble sycophants follow the Duke’s example, and Saffron watches in amusement at seeing the whole table go slack, their eyes staring off into nothing as they ', '.', 'At the edges of the room the white-coated servants, the red-coated guards go on alert. Saffron knows, for he has told her, that the commander of the guard dislikes these little interludes. But the Duke will have his perks, and further—she is told—it amuses the Duke to watch the lords and ladies squirm. Not all the confections Danny makes evoke pleasant memories, and during their time in the Duke’s palace, he has been encouraged to experiment. An invitation to a Temporal Confections dinner is equally coveted and feared, but never declined.', 'Around the table the diners slowly shake off the residue of the memory, come back to themselves with foolish smiles on their faces. Good, she thinks. Danny is outdoing himself tonight. Is that a hint of things to come? They are kept apart, in the castle, and she wishes they had some way to communicate, other than through memory. A memory can be directed, a little, if the eater has practice. Saffron knows what she wants to see with the Rosemary Crostini, and she knows Danny knows she will see it. It was a gift to her this night, that first flush of meeting, that moment trapped in time like a fly in amber.', 'A salad course of watercress and arugula is served, and wineglasses filled with a dry white. The Duke’s regular taster is given his salad, a fresh fork. She is a perpetually frightened-looking girl with honey-colored hair, but she is no milkmaid from the countryside. She is eighth in line to the throne, the granddaughter of kind Lord Searle, that same Lord Searle who would make a remarkably good regent—if he had not been accused of treachery by the Duke and disappeared into the maze of dungeons under the castle.', 'The girl retains many of her daytime privileges, but at dinner she sits at the Traitor King’s side, yet another hostage for others’ behavior. She tastes the requisite bite of the peppery greens, and then the plate is relayed to the Duke, and he picks up his own silver fork. Around the table the others join in, and Saffron and the girl fold their hands in their laps, and wait.', '\\xa0', 'The sun is sparkling on the snow on the day Danny gets his first temporal pastry to work.', 'It is a Seventhday, and the shop is closed. They have been married for a year now; Danny’s grandfather has passed on, and the little bakery is all Danny’s. A small inheritance has allowed him to experiment; a small inheritance and a smaller glass bottle of dried rose-thyme that Danny’s grandfather gathered as a youth in the distant High Reaches. Despite its name, rose-thyme does not taste precisely like either; or, more correctly, it tastes like many more things than just those two flavors. It is a changeable plant; the method of preparation is key to bringing out a particular aromatic strain. More importantly, the method of preparation is key to evoking certain visions. As a child, Danny’s grandfather and his chums would chew on the flowers, which, when eaten plain, give brief flashes of déjà vu. He also told Danny that those who had once lived in the High Reaches had actual recipes that they swore could evoke glimpses of longer-ago memories, and indeed, at winter solstice every year, there was a certain currant cake made with the rose-thyme that would make everyone remember the previous solstice’s currant cake, and back and back, cementing the continuity of a long line of years.', 'All that was long ago, and Danny’s grandfather’s people were mostly scattered and gone, driven forth by the last king’s brother, whose dukedom was in the High Reaches, at the border of the country. He and his son, Michal, were reputed to be cold and cruel. Certainly they had destroyed Danny’s ancestral home. But the current King was kind, if perhaps a bit soft, and he had not taken steps to control his distant cousin anymore than his father had controlled his younger brother.', 'All this runs through Saffron’s head while she stands at the back of the shop, slowly kneading a mass of dough that will rise overnight for tomorrow’s buns. Watching the sky slowly darken, the snow clouds massing once more. Why is she thinking of the old king? But perhaps it is because of the clock tower bells. They have been ringing all morning, and she has not heard them ring like that since she was a child. Their slow pealing is an eerie counterpoint to the silent snow, the warm, empty shop. A cheerful whistle floats out occasionally from the other room of the bakery, punctuated with the sharp smell of dried fennel being crushed with mortar and pestle. Danny is experimenting yet again.', 'Someone bangs on the back door, and she opens it to a snowdrift. Little Jacky, older now. He comes in, stamps his feet.', '“The King is dead,” he says, “Did you know?”', 'Of course, she thinks, ', ', and behind him the flurries have started again, the spangles of sun replaced by fat dots of white.', '“Ma says they’ll make old Searle the regent. He’s a soft touch, that’s for sure. Gives out coppers to kids anytime you see him in the street. Hey, maybe he’ll give out silvers if he’s got a whole treasury.”', 'Saffron shakes her head. She saw the King speak, not two months ago. He was grieving for his wife’s death in childbirth, and the city grieved along with him. But. . . “He was so healthy.”', '“Bloody flux,” Jacky says with certainty. “Got my cousin last month.” He holds out his palm. “I got ', ' coppers for you this time. Been working for my uncle. What can I get with that?”', 'She ruffles his snow-dusted hair and hands over a hearty round loaf that didn’t sell, and several currant buns, only a little burnt.', 'He shouts his thanks and hurries off, running through the falling snow. His bit of red scarf flaps behind him; he shrinks smaller and smaller in the vanishing white. The king is dead, the poor little prince an infant. There will be change. Change is hard to weather. Change makes everyone skint, and keep their coins in their pockets.', 'But the people will still need bread, she thinks, as she watches the diagonal drifts. And there has been peace for so long. How can there not still be peace? Power will transfer, the reins will change hands, but she and Danny will have their bakery, their dough, their bread. They will focus on the rising of the yeast and the pounding of the dough and if they have to cut out currants for a time, well, plain buns sell nearly as well.', 'The clock tower bells ring all day and all night for the end of the king, the ending of the old era. She stands for some time, looking at the falling snow, until behind her Danny shouts, I have it, I have it, Saffron, I have it.', 'She turns to see the exult on his face, and he scoops her up and swings her around. He has been parceling out the last few sprigs of rose-thyme for months, trying recipe after recipe, running right through the last of the dried leaves.', 'Now he hands her a round circle of flatbread on a plate. It looks like any of Danny’s homey flatbreads, but smaller. A few bites only, and one bite is missing.', 'She knows already that there is something special about this moment. It is the sort of memory you recall for years after. A moment when the world changed around you. A moment etched with both beauty and loss, a moment that you leave behind as you move away from it, a moment you can never reach again.', 'Except, with what Danny has now made, perhaps you can.', 'Saffron takes the first bite ever of a temporal confections creation and falls back further still.', 'The world shifts around her. She is seven, and her mother is still living. The sun drifts golden onto a dew-spattered morning, and she shakes a magnolia tree onto Rosie, watching her sister laugh as the droplets spray—', '\\xa0', '“Another masterpiece,” says Saffron, and the same white-gloved servant passes her plate to the Duke. She shivers, deep inside, for she is not lying. Danny has been working on that linked memory trick for years. She has seen the Fennel Flatbread creation memory before, but she has never seen that magnolia tree memory within it. Usually the scene ends the moment Danny hands her the flatbread and she takes a bite.', 'Around the table eager hands reach for the plates, barely able to wait for the Duke. A Fennel Flatbread of Sunlit Days Gone By sounds delightful; not like any of the Duke’s nastier tricks. They all could use a moment of nostalgia, of respite from their grown-up cares. They eat, and Saffron watches them, still wondering how Danny triggered the second memory. Perhaps it was in the mashed fava bean dip served alongside, perhaps it is something in the flatbread itself. He has been working on reductions, on methods of increasing the intensity of the herbs. But of course, he has not been able to share anything with her since coming to the palace. And truly, it is better if she does not know. She has never been very good at dissembling, though she has been practicing in this last year. Readying the skill for the moment she needs it.', 'The words rise as the memories dissolve; the voices filled with emotion, with wonder.', '—I was climbing a tree; it was cut down long ago', '—I saw my mum, I haven’t seen her in years', '—My boy was young again; he ran to me', 'The Duke scoffs. Whatever he has seen, it has made little impression. “Puerile fantasies,” he says, and swivels to eye Saffron. “I hope the next course will be more suitable to an. . .advanced palate.”', '“Danny’s skill at arranging a balance of flavor and memory is unsurpassed,” Saffron says evenly. If she wished to gently push the Duke she would remind him of previous banquets; the one that ended with the nobles in tears; the one that ended with them overcome with patriotism, swearing oaths to the Traitor King. But she does not want to disturb the fragile balance. Danny is building to something, she is more and more certain. Which means that she is to taste, and be ready. Timing is critical in baking, and here so tonight.', 'Another course is served; a delicate shellfish bisque, but the nobles barely notice what they eat, lost in recounting, reliving, those long-ago moments, made real again for an instant. If the Duke were more observant, he would notice how even the sweetest memory has an edge, for it is something that is lost and will not come again. But perhaps Danny is lulling him, downplaying his skill with the more complicated memories; the ones that linger like the mold on cheese, the yeast in the sourdough, the bitter in the wine.', 'The bisque is finished—Saffron sometimes feels guilty that the main cooks no longer receive the attention they ought—and the servers return with the next pastry course.', 'Ah, thinks Saffron, who recognizes it immediately. Here we go into the darker turn.', 'She could almost be angry at Danny, but she knows whatever he plans tonight has a purpose. The Duke will feast on her tears, but so be it.', 'The silver fork cuts through the pastry and she takes a bite.', '\\xa0', 'She and Danny have been married for three years now. The bakery has picked up, now that they are offering a few ', ' items right alongside the daily bread. There is still no baby, but they are happy with their bakery and their work, and they do not mind—too much. Danny bakes and she assists, Danny invents and she assists. But she does not mind that either, for she has found her own calling at the front of the shop, and it is matching people with the right pastry.', 'There is an art to knowing what people need. Oh, they would all take the flatbread if they could, but do they ', ' it?', 'At first they do not advertise that there is anything special about some of the pastries in their shop. Danny is still working out the strengths and flavors. The first few pastries and confections come with barely a hint, a flash. A memory easily dismissed as natural. The sort of thing that keeps people returning to a bakery where they feel so content, so rejuvenated. So understood. With the increased income, Saffron arranges the shop and sews new curtains and freshens the paint. She hires Rosie to work alongside them, and that gives Danny more time to develop the recipes, strengthen the flavors. Rosie is a natural third point to their triangle; her open, gregarious warmth is a fire they kindle themselves by. She helps them turn the bakery from a shop to a ', '; she encourages customers not to just buy their regular bread and go, but to sit and linger, try that extra morsel of unusual pastry and feel at peace.', 'This morning, Rosie is laughing with a regular about something that happened last night. Rosie has changed the last two years; her curls are the same, but she has swapped her ribbons and laces for steel-toed boots and the cry of ', '.', 'Saffron understands that the new Regent Michal, at first so sympathetic, so distraught about the sudden treachery of Lord Searle, has slowly been closing his velvet glove around the city. She understands that there have been rumors of people taken. Rumors of Bad Things. But she only has one sister, and rumors are not here and now, they are not the shop and bread and cheese and chairs.', 'She pulls Rosie behind the counter, by the trays of day-old regular bread, and says as much.', 'Rosie’s chin sets. It is not the first time they’ve had this conversation. “I have to do ', ',” she tells Saffron. She drops her voice. “You know the little print shop, down the street?”', 'The printer. An outspoken, angry man. Yes.', '“You know they ', ' him, Saffy. Tortured him. Just for printing the truth about what’s been happening to the girls. The disappearances—”', '“Who says, though?” says Saffron, who can’t believe in things happening to people she knows.', 'Rosie gives her a look. “His body was all covered up at the hanging. So you wouldn’t see what had been done to him. I saw—”', '“You ', ' there?”', '“I can’t stay here, safe in a ', ',” says Rosie, voice rising. “I have to ', '.”', '“We are doing good work here,” Saffron says, helplessly.', 'Rosie shakes her head. “This is not the only good work there is to be done. Can’t you see that?”', 'They are close to understanding each other, but then Saffron lets slip: “Can’t someone ', ' do that work?” and that makes Rosie shake her head, and stomp away, off to heft some flour bags around, take out her frustration.', 'Yes, Rosie has changed. Or no, not changed, perhaps, but grown up. Matured into something that was there all along.', 'She can’t just stay in her bakery, Rosie says. But why not? Why can’t there be room for someone who takes care of people, one person at a time? Who feeds them bread for their bodies and confections for their souls and does good work on a single, individual level? Saffron is heavy with resentment, she is prickly with the wish to prove Rosie wrong.', 'That is when the enforcer comes in.', 'He wears the emblem of the palace; the R of the Regency, the eagle of the Duke. He saunters up and says politely, “We have reports of miscreants disturbing the peace last night.”', '“Everything is just fine here,” Saffron says.', '“And your employees?” he says. “Where were they?”', '“We have but one,” she says, “and she is a law-abiding citizen.” Her heart is thumping inside and he can surely see her pallor. ', ' For that is her first thought, that Rosie and her group of troublemaker friends must have done ', '. This man would not be here for ', '. Around the store she sees the customers who have finished their pastries quietly slipping away, their peace at an end.', 'The enforcer’s eyes follow her gaze; he looks languidly around the room like a bored cat. “This is a sort of opium den, is it?” he says, gesturing at a man’s slack face.', '“Merely a bakery,” Saffron says.', '“Please produce your license,” he says, more politely yet, and she understands how to do this part, this part is rote. She gets it from the back room, a few steps away through that curtain. Her eyes sweep the room for Danny—surely Danny will know what to do—but he is out on a buying errand, and she sees only her sister, crouched and silent, hiding behind a barrel of flour.', 'Numbly she returns, shows the man the card that should make him leave.', 'He barely looks at it, lets it fall to the counter. “Please produce your sister,” he says, and this is the point she cannot forgive herself for, even as it happens.', ', she thinks. But she is too used to being law-abiding, and she has never tried to become good at deception. Her mouth hangs open for too long, her eyes flick to the wrong side. “I have not seen her today,” she stammers at last, and the enforcer just laughs at her.', 'He pushes past to the back, and he pulls her sister out. Rosie reams him with a pan, and then he casually punches her in the stomach, so hard she doubles over, and he drags her out, even as Saffron runs after them, armed with nothing. He throws her into a carriage—pushes Saffron down into the muck of the street—and then they are gone, and Saffron is weeping.', 'The scene jumps forward—another linked memory. Danny finding her in the streets, near the castle. Saffron ran after the carriage until she couldn’t run anymore, then she plodded after it till she reached its entrance to the gates, and when they would not let her in, she sunk down and stayed there. She doesn’t deserve to leave the muck, because she failed to save Rosie.', 'Another jump forward, because the hanging does not happen until an entire week later. The body is fully clothed, down to long sleeves and long gloves that Rosie was not wearing when she left. Saffron is left to imagine everything the cloth is hiding. Drawn iron wire fences the hanging square; it cuts red lines into Saffron’s palms. Around her the scent of lilacs blooms thick and sweet. It is spring.', '\\xa0', 'Saffron comes back to herself in the banquet room, and her eyes are wet. She sits up straighter, calmly blots her eyes with her napkin. “The Rose-Pepper Shortbread of Sweetness Lost will show you someone you miss,” she says to the table. “All such sweet memories are tinged with sorrow.”', 'She nods to the servitor to take her plate to the Duke, smiles warmly at the table to put them at ease. “You will find notes of citrus and almond in the tasting,” she says. “We find it is one of the most popular pastries among the elderly.”', '“I certainly hope you are not insinuating anything,” says the Duke, and then he laughs, and then they all do.', 'They take their bites and Saffron breathes out, concentrating on what Danny has done. Three jumps this time. Usually she sees just the bakery, or just the carriage, or just the hanging. Yet somehow he has strung memories together, finding a way to let the whole terrible story unfold.', 'If she had seen a fourth memory, it might well have been the aftermath. For it is a day not long after that when Danny starts experimenting on what he will call the bitter pastries. Not bitter in flavor, necessarily. Certainly deeper in flavor, more profound notes in the tasting. Memories that are both sweet and sour. Memories with a purpose.', 'The first one has a rose flavor, in honor of her sister.', 'Rosie is not the only person Saffron has lost in her life—her parents have both passed away—but she only ever sees Rosie when she eats the shortbread. She suspects that its creation is too inextricably bound up with her sister for her to ever see another. For awhile, there were many Seventhdays that she dedicated to nothing but the rose-pepper shortbread and her grief.', 'Many months later, when she is capable of feeling anything more than numb, Saffron takes her place again at the front of the shop. She understands then that this recipe is what she was lacking to give the customers. Not all customers can be helped with a fennel-bright flatbread, a happy moment. There are many who need a more profound searching into their past.', 'Around her now the nobles return from their journey, their faces a dizzying array of sadness, happiness, regret. It is a complex pastry.', 'The next food course is served—some sort of little trussed-up birds, but Saffron barely notices. She is elsewhere, considering what Danny has shown her, considering what next is to come.', 'She is not surprised when the silver bell rings and out comes the fourth of Danny’s creations tonight, another bitter pastry. It is not one that Danny has yet showcased at the castle. Only now does it make its appearance, and her heart quickens, her lips pucker, her mouth salivates for the taste.', '\\xa0', 'It is an ordinary day in the bakery, and Saffron looks around at her regulars with satisfaction. Everything they have worked for, coming to fruition. She is closer to contentment, closer to peace than she has been in over a year. The loss of her sister will never leave her, but it is a dull ache these days that only sometimes turns sharp, breaks her down in the middle of the bakery, hand on a bag of flour. The bakery has found a new normal, and there are customers to help.', 'The regulars, and she knows them by their orders.', 'Apple Turnover of Happier Times, aka, the bent old woman in the moth-eaten furs.

Either way she lost them during the brief, bloody uprising last spring, they agree on that.', 'Lavender Macaron of Long-Ago Flirtations, aka the angular man who still owns two silk scarves, despite the ever-increasing privations, despite the shabbiness of his old suit.

Obviously it’s a lover, but Danny is sure the lover disappeared in some dramatic way; attacking the palace, or daring to print anti-propaganda sheets.

She’s young, too young to have so much Profound Regret in her life. But she comes every day at ten, testing her sorrow. Profound Regret shows you the biggest mistake you made, the one you brood over, and there are two kinds of people who buy it. The ones that make Saffron’s heart gladden are the ones who buy it infrequently. They descend into the despair of knowing what they did, just as fresh as the day it happened.', 'Then they go off and change, because of what they saw.', 'Saffron knows, because they come back to tell her. Not right at first. But they come back, several months later, and buy the tart again. And this time they see something else. Something less terrible. That’s how they know they’ve moved on.', 'Those are the ones Danny says the whole shop is worth it for. He’d do it all again. Some days it seems like you’re doing so little, but when he helps one of those people, his whole life is justified. On days that are really tough—the stories told about the Duke are worse than usual, the taxes are due, the Profound Regrets are too deep—Danny eats one of his Honey Chocolates of Well-Deserved Pride. He says it always shows him those moments, the ones when he helped people.', 'Their current Lemon Tart comes day after day. She’s not moving on. Danny thinks Saffron should intentionally mix up her order, give her a Honey Chocolate or an Apple Turnover and see if that helps her mindset change. Saffron is considering the merits of this when ', ' comes in.', 'He’s supposed to be incognito but Saffron knows him instantly.

Oh, he will suffer.', 'But it would not just be Saffron who suffers. It would be Danny. It would be the part-time employees. It would be the customers, for she is not naive enough to think that he would not seek his wrath on all who saw his humiliation. He must squash any hint of rebellion.', ', says a smaller voice still.', 'Saffron reaches for the chocolates and his eyes are heavy on hers; it seems he knows her thoughts. She knows why he comes unannounced. So she cannot slip him poison, not unless she has planned for this moment and made an entire tray of poisoned chocolates, and she has not.', '“I am most delighted to sample what I have ', ',” he says, and there is a world of meaning in that tongue.', 'Her eyes close—her fingers close on the wrapper around the chocolate, bring it up. She puts it on the plate with nerveless fingers.', 'It is the Honey Chocolate.', 'Her voice shakes as she tells him the price. Her moment has come, her moment has gone.', 'The Duke takes the chocolate, sits down at a table in the corner. A young man leans casually against the wall, fiddling with his belt knife. He doesn’t fool Saffron. The Duke goes off into a haze of ', ' and for eight heartstopping minutes she cleans the counter and tends to the customers as the Duke looks off in the distance and the young man watches the two of them, his eyes flicking back and forth, watching to see if the bakery worker has lied to the Duke.', 'She regrets her choice already. She does not need a Lemon Tart to know that.', 'She regrets it even more when, two nights later, the Duke’s guards take Danny out of their bed in the middle of the night.', 'She is left to make her own way to the castle and offer herself up as sacrifice. A willing check on any rebellious tendencies my Danny might have. To sell herself to the Traitor King.', 'A common food-taster.', '\\xa0', 'Saffron blinks back tears. She has not seen Danny in so long. The Duke does not trust them together. He has taken Saffron’s measure—correctly assessed her as ineffectual, not a threat. She is plain, ordinary, and the Duke is not so foolish as to spend the coin of her in the wrong place. She is much more valuable alive and whole and as a check on Danny. So the Duke left her free rein of the upstairs servants’ quarters—as long as she does not enter the second kitchen. The second kitchen was turned over to Danny; his tools and herbs brought from the bakery, and he is confined to it. The only way they can communicate is through the confections themselves. There is always at least one confection during a meal that he knows will call up a sweet memory of the two of them—something she can feast upon for a week, and ', '.', 'But this banquet has been leading her step by step forward, as if in a story.

A slow-acting poison; something she will recognize, but must pretend to be fine.', 'But she can’t imagine Danny choosing that method, even if she ordered him to. And at this point, she ', ' order him to. She stiffens her spine, watches the nobles eating their own lemon tarts. She has spent a year practicing dissembling. Her courage and her warm smiles will not fail her now. She is ready for whatever comes.', 'Or perhaps there is something else he is reminding her of. Those small jumps that the pastries have been taking. The Lemon Tart memory skipping ahead, to Danny’s disappearance, to her own application at the castle. Those are not part of the original memory. They are ', ' somehow, just as she saw with the crostini, with the shortbread. Not enough that anyone would notice, because no one understands the subtleties of how the pastries work, not like she and Danny. Were those extra memories there to warn her of something specific?', 'But maybe that is not it, either. Sometimes she thinks she is going mad. Danny is long gone, and these pastries are normal pastries done by a normal pastry chef, their memories some collective dream that she convinces the nobles to believe in, once a week.', 'The cheese plate comes and goes while she feels more and more adrift, lost in her own memories, wishful thinking, and nonsense. These banquets will go on for eternity, and she will eat lemon tarts of regret forever, and nothing will change.', 'For now the after-dinner liqueurs are being passed around, the meal is over, and there has been no dramatic change tonight. She is disappointed; she wants the Duke gone so badly that she almost feels she will run at him herself, with the silver fork. See what damage she can do before they kill her. Danny was always the patient one, the one performing the endless tweaking of recipes in search of the correct formula, the one able to wait until the exact moment. Cooking is all about timing.', 'Ah, but wait. There is one more plate.

Saffron always, invariably, sees one of the times she helped somebody. Danny sees those as well, or he sees moments of creation, breakthroughs of hard work and study.', 'The Duke saw a moment he cleverly destroyed a family. He told the table about it, in salivating detail, and the quiet bliss the nobles had found in the chocolates evaporated. Why would Danny grant him such?', 'The extra-large chocolate is set down before Saffron and she cuts it in two with her silver fork. It is in the last second before she takes her bite that she notices the color of the honey drop on top is a little deeper than usual. Molasses, perhaps, and it is her single clue that this is something different than what she is expecting.', '\\xa0', 'She falls, tumbling, faster and faster. It is a moment she has never seen before.

More than anything.…', '\\xa0', 'The entire table is looking at her. She has been gone a few minutes longer than usual. Hopefully not so long as to give the game away.

And how exactly is she going to do that, with everything she just saw plainly visible on her face to the whole table?', 'She waves at the servitor to take the other half of her chocolate to the Duke. She does not yet trust herself to speak.', 'The Duke looks at the half-eaten chocolate, then back at her. “For a moment I thought your husband had decided he was willing to poison you,” he says. “But now I see he is merely willing to torture you.”', 'That gives Saffron the thread to walk down. “His skill with confections is the most important thing to him,” she says, and she keeps her head high, not minding that her lip trembles. The Duke understands this. He will see himself in Danny.', '“So explain to me why I, and my table, should go ahead and try this particular confection,” he says. “After seeing its most. . . interesting results.”', 'She looks evenly into his face. There is only one answer that will work with the Duke, and this is truth.', 'At least, part of the truth.', '“You will see pain,” she said. “Not your own pain, but another’s.

My little weaklings.” He gestures around to the table. “Go on, then. Eat.”', 'Her heart sinks, watching as one by one the reluctant guests pick up their chocolates, their faces frightened or stoic by turns.

      "{'Title': ['The Nearest'], 'Author': ['Greg Egan'], 'Body': ['When a detective, a new mother, is assigned to the case of a horrific triple murder, it appears to be a self-contained domestic tragedy, a terrible event but something that doesn’t affect the rest of the community. But it slowly becomes clear that something much darker may be at play, something that spreads out from the scene of the crime to corrode the closest relationships of everyone it touches.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Kate heard a knock on the open door of her office, and looked up to see Anneke from dispatch, grimacing apologetically.', '“I’ve got a shocker for you, Sarge. Sorry.”', 'Kate said, “Go ahead.” She’d been back from maternity leave for two weeks; she did not need a content warning for every case that was grimmer than the scenes of cavorting bunnies on her son’s nursery wallpaper. And after spending the morning reviewing a spike in missing persons that was probably just a meaningless statistical blip, she was ready to do anything to get away from her desk.', '“Three deceased: a father and two daughters. Mother’s location unknown.”', ' Kate’s heart sank, but she kept her face expressionless. “Gunshot wounds?”', '“No, all stabbings.” Anneke hesitated. “The girls were young: five and six. If you want, I’ll ask Roma Street if we can hand this over to Petrie.”', 'Kate shook her head impatiently. “So do I get a DC, or am I on my own?”', '“No DC, but there are four uniforms at the scene you can use for the day.”', 'Kate bit back a string of expletives; Anneke was just the messenger. Some half-baked algorithm had already decided that this was a self-contained domestic that posed no threat to the wider public, and would more or less solve itself. Until she could prove otherwise, there was no point begging for more resources.', 'Anneke flicked the report from her notepad to Kate’s; Kate opened the document as she got to her feet and picked up her key fob.', 'On her way to the car, she read the summary from the officers who’d attended the scene. The deceased were believed to be Robert Mellish, Angela Grimes, and Isabel Grimes; the missing woman was Natalie Grimes. Natalie’s mother, Diane, had tried to call her daughter the previous evening. When she still hadn’t been able to make contact by midmorning, she’d gone to the house and let herself in, finding the deceased lying in their beds. There were no obvious signs of a break-in. The family’s station wagon was gone, but Natalie’s phone was on the bedside table.', 'When Kate reached the house there were two squad cars and a SOCO van parked in the street, but their presence had attracted no onlookers; it seemed the neighbors here had the decency not to flock around the blue-and-white tape, gawking, while the ever-economising clickbait sites were probably waiting for a chance to outsource their photographic needs to the next fast food delivery that overflew the crime scene.', 'Kate spoke with the officers who’d made the report, and the two colleagues who’d joined them; they were from the small community policing station in the nearby shopping precinct. With no crowd for them to manage, she decided to send three of them door-knocking.', 'Diane Grimes was sitting in one of the squad cars, drinking coffee that the shopfront cops must have brought for her. Kate introduced herself and joined her in the back of the car.', '“Who’d do this?” Diane asked. Her teeth were chattering. “And why would they take Natalie? She would have torn their eyes out before she let them touch the girls.” Her daughter’s house was modest, single-story brick. Diane looked about seventy, plainly dressed, with no jewelry. Kate was fairly sure that she hadn’t stumbled on a hitherto unknown crime family, enmeshed in a bloody feud in the suburbs of Brisbane.', '“Did Natalie or Robert have any debts that you know of?” Kate asked.', '“Just the mortgage.”', '“They weren’t asking you for money lately?”', '“No. Why would they be?” Diane seemed annoyed at the sheer absurdity of the question; it made too little sense to be offensive.', 'Kate found it hard to see how the couple could have racked up drug or gambling debts that merited a more severe punishment from even the most sadistic loan shark than a broken limb or two. And two teachers at a government high school would make unlikely targets for the kind of heist or abduction that could go so wrong that it left three bodies in its wake.', '“Robert was the girls’ father?”', '“Yes.” Diane scowled. “Natalie kept her own name when they married, and she gave it to the kids. Why shouldn’t she?”', 'Kate shook her head, disavowing any opinion on the matter. “I just need to be clear what his relationship was. And as far as you know, was he ever violent toward her, or to the girls?”', 'Diane said, “Even if I’m the world’s worst judge of character and he fooled me completely, she would never have put up with that.”', '“Okay. Were either of them depressed, or medicated for any reason?”', '“No.”', 'Kate reached over and squeezed her arm. “There’s an alert out for the car. You don’t have to stay here; we’ll call you as soon as we have any news.”', '“I want to be here,” Diane insisted. “What if she comes home?”', 'Kate spared her an opinion on how unlikely that was looking. “Is there someone we can call, to be with you? A friend, or a family member?”', '“My son’s at work.”', '“Can’t he take the afternoon off?”', 'Diane said numbly, “I haven’t told him yet. How can I tell him?”', 'Kate got the number from her and made the call. Patrick Grimes was an electrician, working on a building site in the city; it would take him forty minutes to get here.', 'She left Diane with the constable, and knocked on the side door of the van. The SOCO, Tim Ng, let her in and she joined him in front of the console.', '“What’s the swarm got so far?” she asked.', '“No signs of forced entry,” he said. “There’s a window that’s been left open in the laundry, probably just to cool down the house overnight, but no footprints or scuff marks anywhere near it to suggest that it was used to gain access.”', '“What are you thinking for time of death?”', '“Breakdown profiles from the bloodstains all say yesterday morning, but we’ll really have to wait for the autopsies.”', '“Yeah. And the weapon?”', 'Tim turned to the console and took the view of the interior into the kitchen, tracking in on a slotted wooden block holding a set of knives. The largest slot was empty. Then he pulled back and turned into a passageway that led to the three bedrooms. On the floor, outside the nearest bedroom, was a bloodied knife whose blade the overlaid dimensions showed as matching the slot.', '“Whose room is that?” Kate asked.', '“The older girl, Isabel, according to the grandmother. The next one is Angela’s, and the parents’ bedroom is at the end of the hall.” Tim steered the view down the passageway, into the master bedroom. The drones had imaged the whole house at a moderate resolution on their first pass, but even as Kate watched, the scene in the bedroom was growing visibly sharper as new data flowed in.', 'Robert Mellish lay on his back on one side of the double bed. The top sheet had been drawn toward the foot of the bed, down to his knees. He was wearing only a pair of shorts, and his glasses were sitting on the bedside table. A single, deep stab wound pierced the middle of his chest; an anatomical overlay suggested that the blade had entered his heart.', 'He had no defense wounds on his hands. Kate supposed he might not even have been awake when he was killed.', '“There’s a blood trail that starts from here,” Tim said, aiming the viewpoint toward the floor on Robert’s side of the bed, then following a series of congealed droplets out of the room and down the passage. Kate steeled herself as they pursued the trail into Angela’s room. This time, the killer hadn’t pulled the sheet away; the knife had gone right through it, and through the girl’s nightdress too. Kate felt acid rising in her throat, more from anger than nausea.', 'There was no more frenzy here than there had been with Robert: a single wound, positioned with care, had done the job. If not for the improvised weapon, it could almost have been a professional hit. A mother in the grip of psychotic depression was more likely to drown her children, or feed them sedatives—and then join them in the darkness herself. What kind of delusion would it take to make a woman kill the people she loved, and neither soften the act with some degree of faux gentleness, nor explode in uncontrollable rage, but just dispatch them, methodically and efficiently, with whatever tools were to hand?', '“Go on,” she told Tim.', 'The scene in Isabel’s room was almost the same, the modus operandi identical. A bloody handprint had been left on the doorframe; unwrapped by the software, its size was consistent with a woman of Natalie’s stature, which Tim had estimated at around one hundred and forty-five centimeters from wedding photographs on display in the living room. Still, a hypothetical intruder need not have been particularly large or strong, especially if they had an accomplice to help keep Natalie from intervening. If there was no apparent motive for malevolent strangers to do any of this, nor was there one for Natalie herself.', '“Any meds visible?” Kate asked.', 'Tim shook his head. But the drones couldn’t weave their way into every closed drawer and childproof cabinet in the house. “We could go for the sewerage pipes and do a metabolite analysis,” he suggested.', '“That’s too slow.” Getting access to the family’s medical records would probably take even longer. Either Natalie was severely ill, and a danger to anyone she encountered, or she’d been abducted and was in danger herself; Kate needed to know which it was. “Can you plot me a route to check the likely places?” Once she set foot in the house, there was nothing she could do to avoid contaminating the scene to some degree, but if she did as she was told it would be easier for the system to subtract her out of the picture.', 'She put on a plastic suit, gloves, cap and booties, then approached the front door with her notepad in her hand, displaying the path for her to follow.', 'The door had been left open, wide enough that Kate didn’t need to touch it. She glanced back and saw a smear of blood on the inside handle. She walked straight down the entrance hall, past the living room, and turned into the kitchen. There were four drawers and three cabinets that the swarm had been unable to infiltrate, and one of the cabinets contained an assortment of over-the-counter painkillers, laxatives, antacids and allergy treatments. But there was no prescription medication, let alone antipsychotics.', 'She followed the path through to the bathroom, but the one unexamined cabinet there held nothing but cosmetics, shampoo and shaving cream.', 'Suddenly, she heard something slam against the back door of the house, and a dog began barking and whining. Kate spoke into her notepad. “Tim?”', '“Yeah?”', '“There’s a dog out back, going crazy. What’s the best thing I can do?” The drones hadn’t scanned the back yard yet.', '“If you think you can calm it down without letting it into the house, that would be better than having it tearing up the lawn.”', '“Okay.”', 'Kate followed her new route on the schematic, walking through the laundry room and up to the back door. It needed no key to open from the inside; she unlatched it, and positioned her body to block access as she came out.', 'The dog was a golden retriever, waist-high to her. It barked loudly but didn’t attack. As she emerged, closing the door behind her, it started running in circles, making a pitiful sound.', 'Kate squatted down, put her notepad on the ground and held out her hands. “Shh. Come here, it’s all right!”', 'The dog approached her, wagging its tail and barking. “It’s all right!” Kate repeated soothingly. The dog was wearing a collar; if she could get hold of it, she was fairly sure she could keep the animal still. “Come here!” She took off her gloves and cap and stuffed them down the front of her suit, hoping she’d look more human.', 'The dog came right up to her and pressed its head against the side of her body, whimpering. “Shh.” She stroked its head and got her hand around the collar. It struggled for a moment, but then gave up and sat, resting its head on her knee.', 'Kate was about to call the local animal shelter, but then she had another idea. “Tim?”', '“Yes.”', '“Can you ask Diane Grimes if she wants to take the dog for a while?”', '“Will do.”', 'Kate looked out across the yard; there was a swing set, an above-ground swimming pool, and in the rear, a veritable forest of fig trees, like some enchanted grove out of a fairy tale. The girls would have been in heaven here.', 'She started weeping silently. The dog tried to pull away, then changed its mind and jumped up, licking her face. Kate tugged on the collar and dragged it back down, then got herself under control.', 'Tim said, “Yeah, she’ll take it. Bring it round through the side gate on your right, over the concrete path. That’ll do the least damage.”', '\\xa0', 'As Kate pulled into the driveway, she heard Reza enunciating excitedly, “', ' who’s home! ', ' who’s home! ', '”', 'Before she’d opened the car door, he came out onto the porch with Michael, who was peering toward her, unfocused but tentatively smiling. “Say ', '!” Reza urged him. “Welcome to our house.”', 'Kate said, “Now you’re just being sarcastic.”', 'Reza grinned. “Sorry.” Kate kissed him, then took Michael in her arms; he flapped his own arms excitedly, then beamed at her and started babbling.', '“Someone still appreciates me.” Kate kissed her son’s cheek three times, as noisily as she could, and Reza held the door open for her as she walked into the hall.', '“Do you want me to take him for a bit while you unwind?” Reza asked her.', '“No, I’m fine.”', '“Okay, I’ll start cooking.”', 'Kate sat in the kitchen, gazing into Michael’s face, engrossed by his responses to her monologue of flattering rhetorical questions. “Who is the most beautiful boy? Can you guess who that is?” Sometimes her words seemed to amuse him, sometimes he frowned in puzzlement. But so long as he was content, watching him was like floating in a warm, tranquil pool—and with the scent of herbs frying and the sound of the gentle sizzling of oil, she felt as if she’d been transported into some otherworldly paradise, as remote from the place she’d just left as waking life from a dream.', 'After a while, Michael closed his eyes, but Kate let him sleep in her arms until dinner was ready, then she put him down in his cot and joined Reza to eat.', '“I’m glad you could get home before he slept,” Reza said. “Have things quietened down at all?”', '“Yes, though not in a good way. We still haven’t found the missing woman.” Kate didn’t want to talk about the case, or even think about it for the next twelve hours if she could help it. “How was the bundle of joy today?” she asked.', '“Joyous as ever. I think it’s going to take some serious teething before he can be bothered losing his cool.”', '“I don’t know where he gets that equanimity from,” Kate marveled.', 'Reza frowned. “There’s only one possibility, surely?”', 'Kate wiped her plate clean with the last piece of bread and leaned back in her chair. “That was delicious. Thank you.”', '“', '.” Reza stood up and took her plate, then bent down to kiss her forehead. “I’ve got a favor to ask you.”', '“Sure.”', '“Do you mind if I visit my father tonight?”', '“Of course not.” In truth, Kate had been hoping she could fall asleep on the couch beside him, watching something lighthearted and distracting, but Reza had been stuck in the house for the last six days, and he hadn’t seen his father for a fortnight. “When do visiting hours finish?”', '“Nine.”', 'Kate glanced at the clock. “You’d better go right now. I’ll clean up here.”', 'He kissed her again, put her plate in the sink, picked up his keys and headed out the door.', 'When his car had gone, Kate sat for a while in the silence, then got up and made herself busy with the dishes. When she’d finished, she went to the living room and flicked through the TV’s menu, but none of the sitcoms did it for her when she watched them alone.', 'She walked down the hall into Michael’s room, and gazed down at his sleeping form, barely visible in the faint light that came through the curtains from the street lamps. ', ', she thought. ', ' She could feel her heart beating faster. She tried to calm herself, stepping back and scrutinizing her own hyper-vigilance. She had no reason to think that her son was in any danger at all.', 'But she stayed in the room, watching over him, until she saw the headlights coming into the driveway.', 'Reza didn’t seem to be in a mood to talk, but when they were in bed Kate worked up the courage to ask gently, “How was he?”', '“He thought I was his brother,” Reza replied. “He thought I was Amir.”', 'Kate tried to make light of it. “I don’t think you look much like your uncle.”', 'Reza smiled. “He had a lot more hair when he was my age. And a different hairstyle every month. One of them must have been a match.”', '“Was he happy to see you anyway?” Kate asked. She knew that Hassan and Amir had been close; better a visit from his brother than from a total stranger.', '“He was happy to have Amir to talk to, but not so happy about where they must have been.”', '“Back in Isfahan?”', 'Reza shook his head. “He thinks he’s in immigration detention. Why else would he be locked up by people speaking English?”', '“Jesus. I hope the staff there are nothing like those pricks.” Kate’s most enduring memory of all the stories she’d heard from Hassan had been the time some fresh-faced girl from Port Augusta—probably nineteen or twenty, knowing nothing of life, puffed up with self-importance by her uniform—had told this man who’d seen his parents executed by the mullahs, and who’d spent four years imprisoned in various corners of the Australian desert, that because he was on hunger strike he would be treated like a child, and denied such extravagant privileges as phone calls and visitors, until ', '.', '“They do their best,” Reza said. “And I don’t think he thinks that all the time.”', 'Kate took his hand and squeezed it.', '“I just need to show a makeup artist photos of my grandfather,” Reza mused. “With a few wigs and costumes and the right soundtrack, I bet I could take him back to the days before Khomeini.”', 'Kate laughed softly. Then she said, “What if you brought him here?”', 'Reza was silent for a while; he must have thought about it many times, but he’d never broached it with her. “It wouldn’t work,” he said finally. “Watching him and Michael at the same time would be impossible.”', '“Okay.” Kate felt a twinge of guilt; she’d only dared ask because she was almost certain of the answer. “But maybe you can talk to the doctor about the best way to make him feel…” She groped for the right word; how could he feel ', ', when he really couldn’t walk out the door? “Normal.”', '“Yeah. I’ll phone her in the morning.”', 'Kate switched off the bedside lamp and lay in the dark. The money they were paying for the nursing home would be enough to pay for some part-time home care; Reza wouldn’t have had to handle everything alone. But she could not have her father-in-law living in the same house as Michael. Nothing she’d seen or heard had ever made her think that he would harbor the slightest ill will for any child, whether or not he was capable of understanding that the boy was his grandson. But once someone lost their grip on reality, it wasn’t safe to make any assumptions at all about what they might do.', '\\xa0', 'Kate was dragged out of sleep by her phone buzzing, with a tone indicating the kind of alert that wouldn’t leave her in peace until she responded with a suitably lucid acknowledgment. She picked the thing up off the table by the bed and peered at the screen.', '“Copy that,” she intoned hoarsely. “I’ll be there in twenty minutes.”', '“What is it?” Reza asked. He sounded more awake than she was.', '“They found the car.”', 'When Kate arrived at the riverbank, the tow truck was still getting into position. Natalie’s station wagon had veered off this quiet road at a point where there were no real barriers between asphalt and water. It had left a trail of minor damage in the grass and reeds; to any passing motorist who’d given it a second thought, it probably looked no more suspicious than someone having tried to use the grass to make a U-turn. But tonight, an ER nurse on her way home from her shift had seen moonlight glinting off the metal bobbing in the reeds, and slowed down to take a closer look.', 'The water where the car had ended up wasn’t deep; the two traffic cops who’d come to investigate had reached it in waders. Kate was still waiting for Roma Street to authorize divers, but she doubted they’d find anything. If Natalie had been able to get out of the submerged car at all, she would not have required any superhuman abilities to make it back to the riverbank. This looked more like an attempt to hide the vehicle than an attempt at suicide. If she’d been overcome by remorse, she would have driven off a bridge.', 'Kate stood and waited while the traffic cops and the tow truck operator hooked up the winch and dragged the station wagon out of the water and up onto the back of the truck. Then the truck got bogged in the mud, so they had to put boards under the wheels to free it. By the time the truck was able to maneuver itself back onto solid ground, Kate had lost patience. She put on a pair of gloves and climbed up beside the station wagon, flashlight in hand.', 'All the doors were closed, and all the windows open; Natalie might well have been able to squeeze through a window, conscious and unharmed, but it seemed unlikely that her body had just floated out. The interior was full of silty water and vegetation, and anything not fixed that had been on the seats or the dashboard would either be buried in that muck or left behind in the river. Kate reached in and opened the glove box, which discharged a stream of water carrying a pair of plastic sunglasses and a chapstick. She groped below the dashboard for the manual release for the hood, fought with it against the sludge and grit that was blocking the mechanism, then finally heard a satisfying click.', 'When she walked around to the front of the car and peered in, she saw the black box, still intact. The data recorders were meant to be robust enough to survive battery fires, so a few days of immersion would be nothing. She turned and called out to the traffic cops, “Have you got an interface cable?”', '“We should wait until we get to the compound, Sarge,” the older of the two replied.', '“Do you have the cable or not?”', 'He stared back at her for a moment, then walked over to his car. Kate jumped down and went to fetch her notepad.', 'The data only took a few seconds to transfer, but it was encrypted; Kate sat in her car and fought her way through the process of persuading the manufacturer to send her the key. A magistrate had authorized the decryption on the day the car went missing, and she had a digital certificate attesting to that fact, but it still took three attempts to convince the Toyota website that she wasn’t a bot or a hacker.', 'She started with the plunge into the river. Natalie had shut off the driver supervision features ten minutes before, and while the car’s software fell somewhat short of psychiatric qualifications, up to that point it had not assessed her as being affected by any drug or medical condition: She had not been swerving erratically, or shouting obscenities, or nodding off behind the wheel. The manual override had amounted to telling the car not to trust any of its own systems from then on, so while the black box had dutifully logged her GPS coordinates as she steered off the road, the car itself had become agnostic about the wisdom of this behavior. For all it knew, the driver might have had an honest reason to believe that the car’s sensors were broken and it was liable to kill someone if it didn’t butt out and let a human take over completely.', 'But the GPS trace was enough to show that Natalie hadn’t been driving terribly fast at any point. She’d sped up enough to ensure that her momentum would take her over the riverbank and into the water, but she hadn’t slammed her foot down and accelerated wildly, rushing toward oblivion. When the car came to a stop in the water, it hadn’t even triggered the airbags.', 'Kate went back to the morning of the killings and followed the car away from the scene. At first, Natalie seemed to be heading straight for her mother’s house, but when she came within a few blocks of it, she changed her mind. She’d turned around and started driving toward her friend Mina’s apartment, only to back out again. Then her brother’s house. Then two other friends. She’d had no phone with her, and all of these people had claimed that they’d heard nothing from Natalie on that day, or since. But apparently, every time she’d made a plan to seek help, she’d given up on the idea without waiting to be rebuffed.', 'Kate could understand a woman who’d killed her family in a psychotic fugue snapping out of it and turning in desperation to her mother, only to decide at the last minute that she had no hope of being treated with anything but revulsion. But why would she then imagine that a whole succession of other people might be more forgiving, only to abandon that hope each time it was about to be tested?', 'After all the aborted journeys toward familiar faces, Natalie had driven to a shopping mall, far from her own home, and the car had remained parked there for almost three hours. That seemed like a long time to spend gathering provisions for a dash out of town—which she’d turned out to have no intention of doing, unless she’d somehow procured access to another vehicle. She’d taken her bank cards when she fled from the house, but hadn’t used them anywhere; whatever she’d bought in the mall, she must have paid for it with the remnants of her last cash withdrawal of three hundred dollars, from a few days before.', 'When she left the mall, she’d driven around the city in a wide arc until evening, as if she were simply killing time. She’d stopped at a fast food strip around nine o’clock, and then headed for the river to ditch the car.', 'Kate heard birdsong and looked away from her notepad; it was almost dawn. She checked the status of her request for divers; it had been flagged as “on hold” until a forensics team had examined the car itself.', 'She sent Reza a message to tell him she wouldn’t be home, then drove off in search of a diner where she could grab breakfast and use the restroom. In the mirror, she looked puffy-eyed and disheveled; she took off her shirt and washed under her arms. Natalie must have been in a much worse state when she waded out of the river, but maybe she’d been carrying a change of clothes in a plastic bag. After six days, three with rain, it was too late to send in dogs to try to pick up her scent from the riverbank.', 'Kate sat in a booth in the diner drinking coffee until it was almost seven o’clock, then she drove to the shopping mall where Natalie had parked for three hours. The security cameras covered the whole parking lot, and it wasn’t hard to find the moment in the recordings when Natalie drove in, but when she left the car, carrying two large, empty shopping bags, she walked away, out onto the street. Kate went through all the footage of the pedestrian entrances, but Natalie hadn’t doubled back. Whatever she’d bought in that time, she’d bought somewhere else. There were hundreds of small, freestanding shops within an hour’s walk of the mall.', 'Kate returned to the parking lot footage, at the time she knew the car had departed. Natalie appeared, with the shopping bags bulging, but it was impossible to see what they contained. New clothes? Hair dye? Scissors? It wouldn’t take much for her to render herself unrecognizable to anyone but her closest friends. A clear enough shot by a public CCTV camera might still trigger a face-matching algorithm, but she’d have to be much stupider than she’d proved to be so far to offer herself up to that kind of scrutiny.', 'The mall security guard had been watching over Kate’s shoulder. “That’s the woman who killed her own kids?” he asked. Natalie’s face was all over the media as a missing person, but the official line was still far from naming her as a suspect.', '“Maybe.” Kate turned to him with a warning glance; she really didn’t want to hear anyone’s opinion on what fate Natalie deserved.', '“Good luck,” he said.', 'She left the mall and walked out onto the street. “Mark every retailer in a six-kilometer radius,” she told her notepad, “and give me a path that visits them all.”', '\\xa0', 'Kate woke with a headache and squinted at the bedside clock. It was ten minutes to three. She groaned softly and closed her eyes, then felt someone’s warm, naked skin brush against her.', 'She jerked her arm away and leaped out of bed. There was enough light coming through the curtains for her to see the man lying asleep where Reza should have been.', 'She was trembling from the shock, but she tried to calm herself and plan her next move carefully. She thought of going to the kitchen and arming herself with a knife, but if there was a struggle that might not work in her favor.', 'She snatched up her phone and tiptoed into the passageway. The safest thing might be to take Michael out to the car and drive away, before she even risked calling for help. ', ' Any protracted scuffle in the bedroom would have woken her, so he must have been lured out of the room somehow—before being tied up and gagged, maybe drugged, maybe beaten senseless. So she had to get Michael to safety, but then return as quickly as possible, and do it all without waking the intruder.', 'She walked down the passageway in the darkness, treading as lightly as she could. As she entered the nursery, she felt her skin prickling with horror, and she had to cover her mouth with her hand to keep herself silent. She stared at the shape in the cot, afraid to raise the phone and illuminate it, but when she finally found the courage, the harsh light made the revelation unbearable. She staggered back, then fled.', 'She ran into the bedroom and switched on the light. “What have you done to him?” she roared. “What have you done to my son?”', 'The intruder shielded his face with his arm and then lowered it and peered at her groggily. “Kate? What’s happened?” He climbed off the bed and approached her; she flinched away from him, raising one hand with her fist clenched. She didn’t need a weapon; she’d beat the truth out of him with her bare hands.', '“Kate? Talk to me!” He stood, rooted to the spot, feigning concern. “Has something happened to Michael? Should I call an ambulance?”', '“Don’t play games with me!” she bellowed. “Where have you taken him?”', '“Are you saying he’s not in his cot?” The intruder rushed past her, out into the passageway; she followed him halfway, but couldn’t bring herself to go back into the nursery. He switched on the light, then after a while she heard him whispering, “Shh, ', ', it’s all right.” So this man spoke Persian—or was he just mocking her? Had he bugged the house and listened to all the things she and Reza said?', 'He came out from the nursery and walked up to her. “He looks fine to me. What got you so worried?”', 'Kate said, “You have ten seconds to tell me where my son is.”', '“Now you’re frightening me.” The intruder reached down and scratched his hip beneath the waistband of his shorts, as unselfconsciously as if he spent every night wandering half-naked through a different stranger’s house. “Are you sick?” He reached up to put his hand on Kate’s forehead; she grabbed his arm and twisted it, bringing him to his knees.', '“What’s wrong with you?” he gasped, wincing from the pain but keeping himself from shouting, as if his greatest fear was “waking” the mechanical doll he’d planted in the cot. Kate got him in a choke hold; he went limp in her arms, not even trying to fight her.', '“I swear I’ll kill you,” she said. “If you don’t take me to my son, I’ll slit your fucking throat and hang you from a meat hook.”', 'The man started weeping, his whole body shuddering as he sobbed. Kate stared down at his blubbering face, desperately clinging to the hope that whatever he’d done to Reza and Michael that had left him so ashamed, they were still alive somewhere. “Take me to them now, and I’ll say you cooperated. The quicker you do this, the better things will go for you.”', '“All right,” he replied. He sounded utterly defeated. For someone who’d been so brazen just minutes before, he hadn’t taken long to fold.', 'Kate released him and stepped away. “So where are they?”', 'He clambered to his feet. “I need to call someone. They’ll bring them here.”', '“No, no, no!” Kate spread her arms so he couldn’t get past her down the hall. She wasn’t having him summoning accomplices. “', ' take me to them, alone. Are they in the house?”', 'He hesitated. “No. We’ll need to take a drive.”', 'Kate stood in silence, trying to think. She should call for backup, get the fucker cuffed and under control. But if he stopped cooperating, what redress would she have? As soon as she got anyone else involved, there’d be no point threatening to gut him like a pig; he could sit in his prison cell, laughing, while Reza and Michael starved to death, or worse.', '“All right,” she said. “So you’d better put some clothes on.”', 'She walked into the bedroom ahead of him and scooped up Reza’s phone. She’d half expected him to try to flee, but he followed close behind her and proceeded to dress in Reza’s clothes. Kate stood watching him, dazed; not only did the clothes fit him—well enough—his resemblance to her husband was striking, right down to the pattern of freckles on his shoulders and the way his uncombed hair stuck up at the side. But did the kidnappers really think that she’d be fooled by such superficial details?', '“Turn around and face the wall,” she said. He complied, and she dressed quickly.', '“Okay, I’m done. Come on.”', '“Can we take… ?” He gestured toward the nursery.', 'Kate scowled at him, disbelieving; she thought he was about to start crying again. “Why would we take that thing with us? I’ll put it out with the garbage.”', 'The intruder stared at her. “When you get back, with Michael?”', '“Yes! It’s not a priority. Now, come on!”', 'He followed her out of the house; she unlocked the car and got into the driver’s seat. He joined her, and she reversed quickly onto the street.', '“Which way?” she asked.', '“South.”', 'She drove down to the corner and turned toward Gympie Road. There was no other traffic in sight, no lights showing in any of the houses. She glanced at the man, sitting meekly beside her in his borrowed clothes. “So, what was the plan?”', '“What do you mean?”', '“Were you going to ask for money? Or was this about fixing some case? You wanted me to tamper with evidence, or make a file disappear?”', 'He didn’t reply.', 'Kate laughed humorlessly. “And the idea that you could just lie down in my bed and that would ', ' to get them further away… for fuck’s sake, how stupid can you be? You might look a bit like my husband, but do you think I couldn’t tell the difference?”', 'The man said, “What gave me away?”', 'Kate shook her head. “One touch, and my skin crawled. So where are we going?”', '“Herston.”', '“Where in Herston? I’ll put it in the GPS.”', '“I don’t know the name of the street, but I can give you directions once we’re closer.”', 'Kate wasn’t happy, but at this hour the drive wouldn’t take long. If he was messing with her, she’d know soon enough, and he’d regret it.', '“How many of you are there?” she asked.', '“Just me and my friend. And he won’t hurt anyone, I promise. I’d never have got involved if it was going to be like that.”', '“So why did you do it at all?”', '“It was his idea,” the man insisted. “I just went along with it.”', 'Kate frowned skeptically, but this wasn’t the time to start browbeating the only person who could reunite her with her family. Whether he was a simpleton who’d been led astray or a criminal genius who’d thought it was a good idea to climb into bed with her would be up to the investigating officers to decide, then the prosecutors, then a jury. Once Reza and Michael were safe, she would need to step back and leave everything to other people.', '“How did you get Reza out of the house so quietly?”', '“My friend drugged him.”', '“With what, exactly?”', '“Some liquid he put on a cloth. I don’t know what it was.”', 'Kate suspected he was lying; it sounded like something he’d seen in a movie, and if they’d tried it with chloroform Reza would have been struggling for so long it would have woken her ten times over.', '“And how did you clowns even get into the house?”', '“The spare key under the flowerpot.”', 'She fell silent. That was her fault; she should never have put it anywhere so obvious.', 'They were close to the city now; she could see the lights in the Aurora Tower ahead.', '“Turn right here,” he told her.', '“Past the hospital?”', '“Yes.”', 'Kate turned into Butterfield Street, slowing down as they approached a small park that separated the road from the drop-off loop for the hospital’s entrance. In the early hours of the morning, there could well be visitors to the emergency department with all manner of substances in their bodies stumbling out from behind the greenery and onto the road without warning.', '“And go left here.”', 'Kate brought the car to a halt. He was directing her into the hospital’s parking complex.', '“What are you trying to tell me?” she demanded angrily. “Have they been hurt?”', '“No. I promise you, both of them are fine.”', '“Then why would they be here?”', 'The man said, “We need to go in. Please.”', '“', '”', 'Before Kate could stop him, he was out of the car, running back along the road and through the trees. She went after him, bewildered. The park was about the size of her back yard; he had no hope of losing her.', 'She caught up with him just outside the entrance to the emergency department. She’d feared she was going to have to tackle him to the ground on the concrete, but he stopped and turned, letting her collide with him, catching her in his arms so that their bodies came together in a sick parody of an embrace. She pulled away, furious. He smelled exactly like Reza, but that just turned her stomach.', 'He said, “Kate, I’m begging you, let them check you out.”', '“What?”', '“Let the doctors examine you. I can stay here with you, but you need to let me call someone to look after Michael.”', '“If you think I won’t hurt you just because there are people around—”', 'The man held his hands up, shoulder high. “Look at me! If you don’t believe I’m Reza, tell me one thing that isn’t the same!”', 'Kate was tired. “You’re the right build, the right bone structure. Black hair and brown eyes aren’t exactly rare—assuming they’re natural—but everything else could be done with makeup.” Hadn’t Reza himself claimed as much, joking that he could pass for his own grandfather? ', '“Is that a professional opinion, DS Shahripour?” he taunted her. “Would you talk shit like that in court? Ask me something only Reza could know.”', '“I’m not playing this game.”', 'He said, “I’m not a doctor, I don’t know what’s wrong with you. But what if it’s a stroke? If you’ve got a clot in your brain…” He put his forearm over his eyes, wiping away tears. “Please, Kate, let them help you.”', 'Kate stared at him in the harsh light of the entrance. Every small, dark hair on his cheeks was precisely where she’d expect it to be. The idea that anyone outside of Hollywood would even try to reconstruct that level of detail was ridiculous.', '“Let’s go in,” she said. They were in the right place, after all.', 'They stepped through the self-opening doors together. As Reza was looking around to see where they should go to join the queue, Kate spotted a pair of security guards. When Reza walked forward, she veered away from him, approached the guards, and discreetly showed them her badge.', '“That man is my husband,” she said quietly. “I need your help restraining him so he can be examined, otherwise he could be a danger to himself.”', 'Kate stayed a few steps behind as the three of them approached Reza together. He spread his arms in a gesture of disbelief. “What is this? Kate?” He turned to the guards. “My wife is ill. I don’t know what she told you—”', '“You need to calm down, sir,” one of the guards said firmly. “The doctors are busy, but if you wait quietly someone will be able to see you soon.”', '“No, ', ' needs to see them! She’s the one who’s sick! Our son is in danger.”', '“Sir, if you start making threats—”', '“Kate? What did you say to them?” Reza—or whatever it was that now animated the shell of his body—glared at her in self-righteous horror.', 'Kate told the guards, “I’ll be back as soon as I can. Until then, you need to make sure that he gets a full psych evaluation.” They did not look happy, but they deferred to her authority.', 'She turned and walked away, glancing back a couple of times as the remnant of her husband began shouting and struggling. The guards had handcuffs, batons and Tasers; he wasn’t going anywhere.', 'On her way back to the car she started sobbing. When she pictured Reza—the man she knew, as he’d been just a few hours before—the thought of abandoning him in this wretched state horrified her. But she had to trust the doctors to take care of him; she couldn’t stay here waiting for a diagnosis. What mattered now was finding Michael.', 'As she drove north, she thought of calling the station and sending someone to the house ahead of her. But how could she explain walking out on her infant son, without sounding like she’d lost her mind? Michael had to be lying on a blanket somewhere, sleeping through all of this insanity. Maybe Reza had risen in the night and quietly hidden him, acting with good intentions in some strange twilight state before he was gone completely—saving his son from the thing he was about to become.', 'Kate couldn’t stop weeping. She took her hands off the wheel and let the car steer for her as the rain began to fall. Was it some kind of Alzheimer’s, like his father? But that made no sense; even if the early-onset form could strike at such a young age, she’d never heard of it happening overnight.', 'When she turned into her street, she saw a squad car outside her house, and lights on inside. She stopped and switched off her headlights, but kept the wipers running. Had a neighbor heard her shouting threats before she left?', 'The front door opened and someone walked out onto the porch: a tall, blond woman in civilian clothes carrying a wailing baby, followed by a uniformed female constable. Kate peered at them through the rain, making the best of the moments of clarity after the blades had swept the windshield clear, before fresh droplets appeared and distorted everything. The woman resembled her sister Beth, though it wasn’t her. The baby was swaddled in a blanket, making it hard to see properly, but it sounded like some awful imitation of Michael.', 'Had the thing in the cot not been a doll, after all? Where would such a doll have come from? ', 'Kate covered her face with her hands. What could turn a human being into a walking automaton, a vacant caricature of the person they’d been? Some kind of toxin? Some kind of disease?', 'When she looked again, the two women were in the squad car. The engine started, and the car drove away. But the lights were still on in the house. Someone was in there, waiting for her to arrive.', 'The thing that had been Reza must have wheedled its way into making a phone call, and whoever it had called had either been fooled into taking it seriously… or had needed no persuasion, because it already thought the same way.', 'Reza had been infected. Michael had been infected. Beth had been infected. How many more might there be? If she walked into that house and shared the same fate, she’d be powerless to help any of them.', 'Kate started the car and reversed back down the street. After ten meters, the supervisor began chanting threats and admonitions. She said, “Shut down, you’re malfunctioning.” She kept going until she reached the corner, then she turned and drove away.', '\\xa0', 'The teller machine took her card without complaint, scanned her face, then offered her the usual menu. Reza had never been in any position to cancel her card himself, but whatever his remnant had told the police, the best thing was to get her hands on as much money as possible while she still could. Kate moved some funds between accounts and then succeeded in withdrawing her entire daily cash limit of five thousand dollars.', 'She sat in the car, trying to clear her head and see the way forward. It was beginning to look as if Reza and Beth, and maybe anyone else in the same condition, could pass as normal to an interlocutor who didn’t actually know them. Once he’d stopped humoring her with nonsense about the “kidnapping”, Reza had spoken coherently enough, making claims that might have sounded perfectly believable to a naive bystander. For all Kate knew, charming the hospital’s security guards into giving him a phone call had only been the start of it; he might even have been able to talk his way through an entire interview with an overworked psychiatric registrar, accustomed to more florid symptoms.', 'Reza’s uncle was on the other side of the country, and Beth had been divorced for years. But some of their friends would surely be able to spot the changes, backing up Kate’s assessment and ensuring the three victims got the treatment they needed.', 'Her phone rang. She stared at it for a while, then answered warily, “Chris? How are you?”', '“I’m fine, Kate. But I’ve heard that people are worried about you.”', ' Of all the colleagues she might have trusted to help her, Chris Santos had been top of the list, but he’d only had to speak two sentences to make it plain that he was infected too. And he was going to parrot Reza’s line that ', ' was the problem? Kate resisted the urge to tell him she was having flashbacks to the time a gaggle of dim-witted scammers had called her one by one to say, “This is technical department of Windows operating system; we have detected a dangerous virus on your computer.” However many of them she told, in no uncertain terms, that they weren’t fooling her, there was always another one the next day trotting out exactly the same line.', '“I had a fight with Reza,” she said. “Not even a fight, more a misunderstanding. It’s all good now.”', 'There was an awkward pause. “It’s just, your sister had to take the baby. No one wants to talk about child neglect charges, and I don’t think it has to go that far. But you need to come in and be interviewed, just to reassure everyone. I think your husband’s still freaked out.”', 'Kate struggled to frame her reply, wondering what the point was in humoring him at all—but it was possible that the call was being shared with people who weren’t just going through the motions, and actually believed she’d been at fault.', '“I understand,” she said. “I’ll be in around nine o’clock.”', '“Can I ask where you are now?”', '“I’m not at home,” she admitted. “I knew Beth was looking after Michael, and I didn’t want to be there when Reza came home. It was just… a bit tense between us. I thought this would give us a chance to cool off.”', '“Okay. But you’ll be at Roma Street by nine?”', '“Absolutely.”', 'Kate stepped out of the car, stacked her phone on top of Reza’s behind the rear wheel, then ran over them repeatedly. ', ' But Kate hadn’t really socialized with the two of them for years; maybe they were estranged, and she just hadn’t heard it through the grapevine.', 'She got out of the car again and inspected the shattered electronics. She was having second thoughts about walking away; maybe it would be simpler to go undercover and play happy families with Reza, pretending that nothing was wrong while she investigated the outbreak.', 'But even if she could be that good an actor, Reza might infect her, dragging her down into the same emptiness. She had to believe that he and Michael and Beth still survived somehow, however deeply they’d been buried—but when she pictured the grotesque effigies they’d become, all she felt was revulsion.', 'The sky was light now, and she could hear traffic sounds rising up amid the birdsong. She hated the thought of abandoning the car, but eventually people would be looking for it, and she had no idea how far the disease had spread through the police force.', 'As she headed down the street, Kate thought of Natalie Grimes, waking in shock to find herself beside the thing that had once been her husband. Walking from room to room, discovering that even her beautiful daughters were gone. Convinced that her family had been erased, their minds irretrievably destroyed, and that the only loving thing to do had been to put the twitching puppets out of their misery.', 'Kate could understand the power of the woman’s grief. But she was not going to give up hope, herself, until she had proof beyond doubt that there was no cure, and that everyone she cared about really was gone forever.', '\\xa0', 'Kate found a small motel where the clerk was happy to take cash up front, and for a modest surcharge allowed her to check in without showing ID. In her room, she sat on the bed staring down at the torn carpet, trying to decide who she could trust to be her allies, now that Chris had been ruled out. She drew up a list of twelve names, but when she thought about each one seriously, her confidence began to wane. It was not that any of them had failed to be loyal and supportive in the past, but when she pictured the actual conversation she would need to have with them to enlist their help, the idea that they would back her seemed preposterous. Each time she played out the scenario in her head, every trace of the old friendships she was relying on simply faded away, and the encounter ended with a cold stare.', 'More than friends, she needed evidence. And since no epidemiologist was going to drop everything and come to her aid, she needed to start with testimony, from as many people as possible, showing that the symptoms she’d observed in her own family had been seen elsewhere.', 'Without knowing the mode of transmission it was hard to say how the disease might have spread, but the neighborhood around Natalie’s house was the obvious place to begin. Kate left the motel and set off on foot, taking care to avoid intersections where she knew there would be cameras.', 'When she arrived, the house itself was still cordoned off. She started with the neighbors on the right, but no one was home; it was only four doors down that she finally got an answer. Her knocking summoned an elderly man who was clearly not pleased to have been woken from sleep—but then, chastened by the gravity of the subject, he invited her in.', '“I know you’ve spoken to my colleagues already,” Kate explained apologetically, “but if there’s anything else you remember from that time, it could be important.”', '“Like what?” the man asked. “I never heard Natalie and Rob fighting. The kids could be noisy; you know how girls that age screech sometimes? But that was just playful. It never sounded like someone was hurting them.”', 'Kate said, “Apart from the family, has there been anything unusual you’ve noticed going on in the area?”', 'He pondered the question, but shook his head.', '“Anyone acting out of the ordinary? Maybe a stranger, maybe not. Maybe even someone you thought you knew well.”', 'He ran his fingertips across his forehead, disconcerted by the apparent suggestion that some neighbor he’d joked with over the fence might have stabbed this family to death.', '“Anyone acting out of character?” Kate pressed him.', '“No,” he said firmly. But with the stakes seemingly so high, perhaps he felt compelled to err on the side of caution. Using the murders as a pretext for her questions was going to make it harder to get an honest response.', 'She worked her way down the street then back, sketching a map of the area as she broadened her search. Having missed her appointment at Roma Street and trashed her phone, she suspected that her badge number would have been revoked by now, so whenever people answered the door with their phone in their hand, she made an excuse and withdrew, lest they ', '-ped her and made things awkward.', 'By early evening, she’d conducted thirty-seven interviews. She was thinking of taking a break and grabbing some food when a door opened and before she’d even raised her badge, the middle-aged woman standing in front of her asked anxiously, “Have you found him?”', '“I’m afraid not,” Kate extemporised. Whoever the woman was talking about, that was almost certainly true. “But I’d like to ask you for a few more details, if I could.”', '“Of course.”', 'Kate identified herself and followed the woman into the house. In the living room, there were family photos: mother, father and teenage son.', '“Is anyone else at home right now?” Kate asked.', '“No, my husband’s in the city. He’s still looking for Rowan. Game arcades, McDonald’s… he’s got no money, but we don’t know where else he’d go to pass the time.”', 'Kate glanced again at a photo of the boy. The face looked familiar; he was one of the missing persons whose cases she’d been reviewing when the Grimes murders took over.', '“Before Rowan went missing,” she asked, “did you notice any change in his behavior?”', 'The woman frowned. “Yes! I made a point of that to the other officer!”', 'Kate nodded apologetically. “I know it’s frustrating to have to repeat yourself, but part of the process is for me to try to come at this with fresh eyes, and make sure we haven’t missed anything.”', '“All right.” The woman shifted uncomfortably in her chair. Kate wished she could remember her name, but there’d been more than thirty files.', '“So can you tell me, in as much detail as possible: In what way did your son seem different?”', '“He was so cold to us,” the woman replied. “He might have had his moods before—he might have been embarrassed or irritated when I said something that a thirteen-year-old boy doesn’t want to hear from his mother—but the day before he left, it was like he had no heart at all.”', '“You mean he was deliberately cruel?” Kate asked.', '“No. It wasn’t that I’d annoyed him and he was trying to be hurtful; it was as if I just didn’t matter to him, one way or the other.”', 'If Rowan had caught the disease that had afflicted Natalie’s family, what was the route of transmission? Kate confirmed with the boy’s mother that he’d attended the high school where Natalie and her husband had taught, though he hadn’t been in either of their classes, and it was hard to see how an airborne virus could have affected him while sparing most of the other students.', '“Have you spoken to the families of Rowan’s friends?” Kate asked.', '“Of course.”', '“And have any of their children undergone personality shifts?”', '“Not that anyone admitted.” The woman hesitated. “I don’t believe that Rowan was taking drugs, but I’m past the point where I’m certain of anything. So if you think that’s a possibility, and it could have something to do with the reason he’s missing, I don’t want you ruling it out just because my own instincts say otherwise.”', '“All right.” Kate didn’t like misleading her, but her own hypothesis was hardly more reassuring.', 'On her way back to the motel, she bought a small notepad with Wi-Fi only, then she used the motel’s internet connection to download a gallery of missing persons whose names and photos had been made public. Rowan da Silva was there, and most of the other people Kate recalled from her review. At least she hadn’t been listed herself, yet.', 'In the next three days, as she spiraled out from the epicenter, she encountered twelve families with sons or daughters, husbands or wives who’d gone missing. In four cases, the person had fled without anyone noticing warning signs, but in the others, the distressed loved ones claimed that the event had been preceded by a change in behavior or demeanor that made them feel as if their relationship had disintegrated, for no discernible reason. “That morning, I swear he looked at me as if he was a trapped animal and I was a zookeeper,” one woman told Kate. “Maybe he woke up and decided that our whole marriage had been a mistake, and it took him another two days to find the courage to walk out. But two days before, he’d either been as happy as I’d ever seen him, or he was the best actor in the world.”', 'On the afternoon of the fourth day, Kate knocked on a door and found herself talking to a woman who spoke with a forced cheeriness and couldn’t quite look her in the eye. She had no missing family members, or any information to offer about suspicious activities in the neighborhood; she just seemed discomfited by Kate’s presence. Either she had a drug lab and a fresh corpse in her living room, or Kate’s time was up.', 'She found a café with Wi-Fi and did a quick search. Authorities had expressed concern about a missing police officer, Detective-Sergeant Katherine Shahripour (pictured). It wasn’t exactly the kind of news that would muscle its way into everyone’s feeds; she suspected that maybe one in fifty people in the city would see it. But the woman she’d spooked would have reported the encounter. It would no longer be safe to keep door-knocking the area.', 'Kate wasn’t ready to come in from the cold. Eight families with stories of sudden alienation wouldn’t cut it; after all, the original investigators had written that off as being down to the usual causes: teenage angst, midlife crises, drug problems, infidelity. At the very least, she needed to bring in some of the afflicted in person, fleshing out her collection of hearsay with actual subjects. Reza might have talked his way out of the emergency department, but if she could drag half a dozen of these fractured families, reunited, into the spotlight, that might be the start of a proper investigation, and the first step on the road to a cure.', 'As she left the café, she tried to picture a future where everything was normal again. But all she could think of was Reza’s bizarre charade, and the husk of her son lying in his cot like a cheap plastic doll. She lowered her sights, and made do instead with memories. The days before, when they had still been themselves, remained as vivid to her as ever. She would hold her feelings for them in that vault, and keep working to find a way to revive them.', '\\xa0', 'Kate cut her hair and dyed it black, then bought some cheap earrings, a battered phone with no SIM card and an assortment of clothes from a charity shop. It took a while for her to find the right look, but at the end of the day she emerged from her room, satisfied that at least she wouldn’t be taken for a cop or a social worker.', 'She walked into the city, and made her way to one of the homeless shelters. As Leila, the volunteer, showed her the ropes, Kate took out her phone and brought up a picture of Suzanne Reyes, a missing woman a few years younger than Kate. “You haven’t seen my sister, have you? When she’s off her meds, I don’t know what she’ll do.”', 'Leila regarded her warily. “Sorry, no.”', 'In the dining room, Kate showed the photo around, but all she got was a few grunts of sympathy. She wished there were some way to seek all eight of her targets at once to better the odds, but it would be stretching credulity to claim a connection with even two of them, and Rowan’s parents had already done the rounds of the shelters. In the dormitory, she lay awake half the night, listening to the other women coughing.', 'She spent the next day on the streets, finding the places where the homeless congregated and asking again after Suzanne. It was close to nightfall when a thin, twitchy woman with a crumpled face squinted at the picture and announced, “Yeah, love, I’ve seen her. Just a few days ago.”', 'Kate closed her eyes for a moment, genuinely overcome with relief. “Thank God. Do you know where she is now?”', '“She talked a lot of nonsense,” the woman complained. “I’m not surprised what you said about her medication.”', '“Yeah, that’s Suzanne. Do you know where she went?”', '“She tried to recruit me,” the woman recalled irritably. “Like a missionary. Like a fucking Mormon Scientologist.”', '“What do you mean?”', '“She wanted me to join her fight against the devil.”', 'Kate shook her head forlornly. “My sister said that? She thinks she’s fighting the devil?”', 'The woman thought it over dutifully. “Not the devil, exactly. She said she’s fighting the hollow men, the ones who’ve lost their souls. Raising an army of the… I don’t fucking know.”', '“Do you know where I can find her?”', '“Not really. I told her to piss off and stop bothering me.”', 'It was growing dark. Kate crossed town and tried a different shelter. “She might not look the same now,” she warned her fellow diners as she helped ladle out the night’s stew. “But maybe you remember her talking about the hollow men?”', 'No one could help her, but the next morning, as the shelter was closing, a young woman with long, plaited hair approached Kate. “I don’t think I’ve seen your sister,” she said. “But there was a man I met, talking like you said she talked.”', '“In what way?” Kate asked.', '“He was warning me about the hollow people. He wanted me to join the fight.”', '“Where was this?”', '“You know that spot in South Bank where all the buskers play?”', 'Kate nodded, but this wasn’t much help; she could probably stand there for a month without the same man reappearing, let alone approaching her.', '“I told him I was busy with other things,” the woman continued, “but he said that if I ever wised up and changed my mind, there was a place where I could find him.”', 'Kate hardly dared breathe, but when the woman said no more she had to ask. “Asgard? Middle-earth? Hogwarts?”', '“An old warehouse that’s used as a squat.” She gestured at Kate’s phone. “If that thing’s got a map, I can show you.”', '\\xa0', 'The abandoned warehouse stood at the edge of a sprawling industrial park that still had a few tenants, but the place itself looked as if it had been derelict for years. The wire mesh fence around it had been bent almost horizontal in places, and the sign warning of security patrols, cameras and dogs was brown with corrosion.', 'Kate clambered over the lowest part of the fence and approached the building, carrying a blanket she’d bought for five dollars from a man camped in a city alleyway. Weeds taller than she was sprouted from cracks in the concrete forecourt. When she tried the office door it was securely locked, even though most of the paint had flaked off, but the roll-up door to the loading bay had been breached, torn away from its tracks on one side. The aperture was a tight squeeze; Kate pushed her blanket through, then followed headfirst. After the sunlit concrete, she couldn’t see a thing inside, but she ended up doing a handstand onto her blanket before her feet fell to the floor.', 'She waited for her eyes to adapt. The place still stank of some kind of oil or solvent, though there was human waste not too far away. Gradually, she made out the silhouettes of a stack of crates and pallets ahead of her, and some large metal drums of chemicals. She walked past them warily, squinting in the gloom at the hazard warnings, hoping that nothing volatile and carcinogenic had spilled out onto the floor.', 'Away from the loading bay, in the warehouse proper, a little sunlight made its way through grimy windows set high in the walls. But a dozen or so fluorescent panels hung by cables from the ceiling; no one had ever aspired to make this place function with natural light.', 'The floor was filthy, strewn with clumps of oil-clotted sand, scraps of yellowing invoices curling at the edges and a few newer burger wrappers and polystyrene cups. In the distance, someone sat on a bedroll, a slight figure with their back to her.', 'Kate called out, “Hi! Is it safe here?” The walls flung her voice back at her.', 'The figure turned and replied, “It’s all right. No one hassles you.”', 'Kate approached. It took her a while to be sure, but once she had clear sight of the boy, she knew it was Rowan da Silva.', '“I’m Kate.”', 'He held out his hand and she shook it, but he offered no name himself. She looked around. “Are we the only ones here?”', '“Right now we are. There’s a lot more people at night.”', '“I heard this was a good place,” Kate said, “but you never know until you see for yourself.”', 'Rowan nodded distractedly, then lowered his gaze and stared glumly at the floor. If he really was suffering from the same disease that had struck Reza, Kate found it hard to discern the effects. With Reza, there had been a yawning abyss between the man she knew and the shop-window dummy he’d become, but with this boy she had no expectations to help her gauge the symptoms.', '“How old are you?” she asked gently.', '“Sixteen,” he lied.', '“You don’t get on with your folks?”', '“They’re dead.”', 'Kate said, “I’m sorry.” She hesitated, but decided not to push him into embellishing the claim. “My husband, how can I put it… showed me a different side.”', '“Like he hit you?”', 'Kate wanted to say yes; it only mattered that she had a plausible story. But something in her rebelled against the slander. “No. He just changed.”', 'Rowan said, “You hear that a lot.” He rose to his feet, then picked up his bedroll and a cardboard sign. “Gotta hit the lunchtime crowds if I want to eat.”', '“Yeah. Good luck.”', 'He wouldn’t make it to the city by lunchtime; he had to mean the nearest mall, some forty minutes away. Kate waited five minutes, then followed him. She caught sight of him on the main road, following the route she’d expected him to take, then she quickly moved to a smaller, parallel street so she wouldn’t be at risk of discovery if he happened to turn around. After crossing back along side streets a couple of times, she soon had a good enough sense of his pace to feel confident that she wasn’t going to lose him.', 'When she was almost at the mall, she spotted Rowan setting up his bedroll and sign on a public street near the entrance. Kate stood beside a tree and recorded video with her phone in one hand and her arm at her side, panning and tilting slowly to sweep the zoomed frame across a range of directions that she hoped would encompass him. It worked, well enough; she managed to extract a still image in which Rowan was clearly recognizable.', 'She circled around the mall and went in through a different entrance, then found a café. She’d spent all her small change, so she had to retrieve a fifty-dollar bill she’d hidden beneath an insole. Between that, her choice of wardrobe, and the acrid smell she’d acquired since showering in the shelter by trekking a dozen kilometers in the heat, she’d never felt more self-conscious, but the waitress took her money without a flicker of disdain and handed her the Wi-Fi password along with her coffee.', 'Kate logged in and created a Gmail account, then sent the pictures of Rowan to his mother, geotagged. She had to assume that Ms. da Silva now knew that she’d been suspended, so she kept the tip anonymous, and resisted the urge to offer suggestions for a medical examination that would probably sound even more bizarre and unwelcome coming from a stranger than from a rogue police officer.', 'She left the café and took up a position outside the supermarket, where she had a clear view of Rowan. Half an hour later, a squad car pulled up in the street, and both of Rowan’s parents emerged. Kate watched them arguing with their son, and when they failed to persuade him to come with them, one of the officers took him by the arm and got him into the car with a minimum of force.', 'She had no way of knowing if they would take the kind of steps needed to get him a proper diagnosis, but there was a chance that at least they could keep him from fleeing again for another few days, in which time she might be able to gather enough evidence of the outbreak to trigger a full-scale public health response, and clear her name to the point where she could make sure that Rowan was included.', 'When the squad car drove away, she sat on a bench in the mall, pondering her next step. She was on CCTV now, and regardless of her changed hairstyle it was only a matter of time before anyone seriously looking for her would be able to start reconstructing her movements.', 'So she had to return to the warehouse that night, or she might not get another chance.', '\\xa0', 'Kate had expected the warehouse to be pitch black by nightfall—with the occasional beam from a phone, deployed sparingly—but it turned out that some of the squatters had obtained what looked like solar-charged hurricane lamps, which they set up on crates to spread a warm yellow light across the cavernous space. There was even a small portable microwave that people were using to heat up food. The mood of the place was almost cozy, as if they’d gathered here to ride out a storm or a flood, strangers united, however warily, against a shared calamity.', 'The squatters around her had been taciturn when she’d introduced herself, but she felt more like a newcomer than an outsider—on probation, not rejected. So far she’d sighted fifteen people, and among them she’d recognized four of the missing whose families she’d interviewed: Suzanne Reyes, Ahmed Fahadi, Gary Katsaros, and Linda Blethyn. Since none of them were minors, or the subject of warrants, there was no point trying to get police involved; it was possible that the best thing she could do would be to keep her mouth shut until morning, then find ways to tip off their loved ones. If she could get enough people who’d been affected by the disease reunited with the people who could recognize their condition, her job would be half done.', 'Gary and Suzanne had been using the microwave, but now Kate saw them walking straight toward her, carrying containers of food.', '“Are you hungry?” Suzanne asked. “It’s Chinese, not too spicy.”', 'Kate nodded gratefully and accepted the meal, then she gestured to the floor and the three of them sat cross-legged on her blanket. Her companions were both around her own age, and though she knew Suzanne had spent time in shelters, both were better dressed than she was.', 'Gary looked around across the warehouse floor. “This isn’t how I saw myself ending up.”', 'Kate laughed sympathetically. “Me neither.”', '“But when my wife changed, I couldn’t stay in the house. I couldn’t stay there, pretending that nothing had happened.”', 'Suzanne remained silent, but she was watching Kate intently. “Changed how?” Kate asked.', '“Hollowed out,” Gary replied. “The first time I saw her, I didn’t think it was her at all. Everything that made her who she was had gone. Just because her face was the same, how could I recognize her without that spark? But it was her body, I had to accept that in the end. Her body was still there; it was everything else that had drained away.”', 'Kate stared back at him, unable to speak. He was not infected with the disease that had claimed Reza and Michael; ', '. Kate had spoken to her for twenty minutes, but to a stranger, emitting the right words in the right order was enough for her to pass as normal.', 'Had they all been hollowed out—everyone she’d interviewed who’d claimed that it was the missing family member whose behavior had changed? ', ' Kate struggled with her memories of the interview. It was one thing to be oblivious to the lack of familiar cues that only someone who’d known her for years would expect, but nothing about her fears for her child had rung false.', 'Suzanne said, “My husband was the same. When I woke up, I thought there was a rapist in my bed. If I hadn’t seen his appendectomy scar, I might have bashed his brains out.”', 'Kate looked down at the blanket. “It was the same for me,” she confessed. “My husband and my son. Then my sister, and one of my colleagues…”', 'Suzanne reached over and squeezed her shoulder.', '“It’s spreading,” Gary said. “The hollowing is spreading. And it’s so hard to stop, because only the nearest can know who’s been taken.”', 'Kate said, “We need to go to the Department of Health. If there are enough of us telling the same story, they’ll have to investigate.”', 'Suzanne responded with the kind of smile that seemed to say they might as well light up the Bat-Signal. “I know two people who did that: a woman and her son. No one heard of them again. It’s spread to the government, it’s spread to the hospitals, it’s spread to the police.”', 'Kate shook her head vehemently. “But it can’t be everyone. It must be just a few.”', '“How can you be sure?” Gary countered. “In someone you know, it’s unmissable. In anyone else, ', '?”', 'Kate had no reply. She’d thought she was close to turning things around, but all she’d done was send Rowan back to the robotic remnants of his parents, to be treated as if he was the one who’d lost his mind. Everything she’d been taking comfort from was being kicked out from under her.', 'Gary said, “The only way to fight this is for each of us to do what no one else can. We need to honor those who were our nearest. Prepare ourselves for what needs to be done, then go back to them and grant them peace.”', 'Kate’s fists tightened, but she spoke as calmly as she could. “Don’t say that. They can be brought back. They can be cured.”', '“This is a war now,” Suzanne insisted. “Do you really think it would be merciful to spare them—and just sit around hoping that a cure is going to fall from the sky, while they spread the infection even further? Imagine a world where people like us are outnumbered. Do you have any idea how close to that we might be, even now?”', '“So have you slaughtered your family?” Kate retorted, knowing the answer full well. She turned to Gary. “Have you?”', '“No,” Gary replied, but his tone made no concession to her stance. “We need to act in concert, all on the same night. They can’t be prepared for this—we need to take them by surprise.”', '“That’s monstrous.” Kate was numb. “You don’t murder people just because they’re sick.”', 'Suzanne said, “It’s the hardest thing you could ask of anyone, but Natalie showed us: If you’re strong, it can be done. If you loved them, and you face up to what they’ve become, it can be done.”', 'Kate had no words. Suzanne squeezed her shoulder again. “It’s tough,” she said. “You need time. We’ll talk again soon.”', 'They left her sitting on the tattered blanket. Kate watched as they crossed the floor and met up with Linda and Ahmed.', 'So this was the brave resistance against the horrors of the plague: people ready to abandon all hope in medicine, and just cull the herd. She could understand how shocking their personal experience had been, but the way they were reading it could not be right. No disease in history had ever spread so fast that the infected outnumbered the healthy.', 'Kate closed her eyes and saw an image of Beth, the big sister she’d worshipped, defending her from a clique of narcissistic bullies on her first day of high school. But then she pictured the shell of a woman she’d seen standing on the porch, holding the thing that had been her nephew. What were the odds that Beth had been infected at the same time as Reza and Michael, unless the disease had run rampant across the city? What were the odds that Chris Santos would be infected too? He lived on the other side of the river.', 'She lay down and curled up on the blanket. The world couldn’t change overnight, without warning. Nothing worked like that; it defied all logic.', 'But she couldn’t deny the evidence of her senses: Reza, Michael, Beth and Chris had all succumbed. Her only hope of proving the catastrophists wrong was to test their dismal hypothesis further. She had to put aside her fears of ridicule and betrayal, and take her story to as many people as possible who she had ever had reason to trust.', '\\xa0', 'Kate slipped out of the warehouse just after dawn, leaving everyone else still sleeping. She’d been afraid that Natalie’s disciples might have had someone watching her, but they could hardly keep all their potential recruits under surveillance. And if she’d tried to turn them in, what would she say, to whom? That half a dozen homeless people were planning an uprising? Did the hollow men and women even understand their own nature well enough to conceive of the uninfected as any kind of threat? If they were just puppets going through the motions of living out the lives that their original hosts would have lived, how could that include any scenario that reflected their own difference?', 'As she strode down the highway, she tried to stare down her qualms and fix on a choice of confidant: someone who lived far from the center of the outbreak that had claimed Natalie’s family, and who had no more reason to be infected than anyone Kate might have plucked off the street at random.', 'Emily had been her closest friend in high school, and if they hadn’t met up in person all that often in the last few years, that had only been a matter of how busy they’d both become. She’d visited Kate just after Michael was born, and when Kate thought back over their conversation, she felt sure that she’d be able to tell at once if anything had changed inside her friend’s skull.', 'Emily was living in Coomera, some forty kilometers south; not exactly walking distance. Kate found a bus stop for the route into the city and joined a small queue of early commuters. She met one woman’s gaze and they exchanged polite greetings. ', ' If this disease spread so rapidly, so easily, how had she been spared, herself? Some natural immunity? Some genetic quirk? She’d survived sharing a bed with Reza, but how many of the hollowed could she share a bus with before her luck ran out?', 'It was midmorning by the time Kate arrived in Coomera, but Emily worked from home, so there was no reason for her not to be around. Kate rang the bell and stood waiting, anxiously. She could feel herself already gloomily prejudging the verdict, on no evidence whatsoever.', 'She rang again, then banged on the door. “Emily?”', 'A young man emerged from the house next door. “I think she’s still away for another week.”', '“Oh.”', '“Either that, or she’s tricked me into watering her plants while she sleeps all day,” he joked.', 'Kate smiled. “I should have called first.” As she walked down the road toward the bus stop, she remembered Emily talking about a business trip to Texas to meet with potential investors. She’d apologized for dropping in so soon after Kate came home from hospital with Michael, but she’d been preparing to leave in the next day or two. Kate hadn’t entirely forgotten; she’d just assumed she would have been back by now.', 'Half an hour into the long ride north, the bus passed a battered pay phone. Kate rang the bell and got off at the next stop. She walked back to the pay phone, trying to recall Emily’s number; it had been years since she’d had to dial it. When she punched her best guess into the keypad, a bland synthetic voice offered her a hint of success: “The number you have dialed currently redirects to an international destination. Do you wish to proceed with the call?”', 'Kate said, “Yes.”', 'After six rings, she heard: “You’ve reached Emily’s phone, please leave a message.” Kate slammed the handset down. She recognized her friend’s voice, but it had been stripped of any trace of warmth and humor.', 'She stood by the phone as the traffic sped past beside her, trying to understand what had happened. Had Emily been carrying the virus even before she’d flown out of Brisbane, and only succumbed to it after she’d arrived in America? And then… what? She’d re-recorded her phone’s greeting, to reflect her new, diminished state of consciousness? Unless she was actually an alien pod-person signaling to her fellow invaders, why would she even think of doing that?', 'Kate called the number again, listened to the recording again. She’d heard the same words dozens of times over the last ten years. And she could not put her finger on any change in timing, pitch, or intonation.', 'She called a third time, covering her left ear against the traffic noise. Every syllable was shaped and positioned just as it always had been—like the freckles on Reza’s shoulders. It was only the deeper meaning that had slipped away.', 'But this was a sound file, a digital waveform—and if it was literally ', ', then any meaning with which the speaker had imbued it ought to remain intact.', 'Kate called again, trying to block out any emotional reaction to the voice and judge it entirely as she would a series of beeps in an audiology test. The result was not what she’d expected: The affectless drone she’d been hearing before suddenly seemed ', ' human, not less.', 'Just as the tone sounded for the caller to leave a message, the faint hiss on the line changed, and a live voice, thick from sleep, said, “Hello?”', 'Kate said, “Emily?”', '“Kate? Is something wrong?”', '“No. Did I wake you?”', '“It’s all right; it’s not that late here.”', '“I didn’t realize you’d still be away.”', '“Yeah… I’ve had a lot of interest in the project, but these things never go to plan.”', 'Kate kept the conversation going while saying as little as possible herself, prodding Emily along with small talk, while tuning her own expectations in and out. The more she sought a feeling of solace and intimacy, the more her friend’s voice mocked and disappointed her. But when she emptied her mind and just listened, everything sounded normal.', '“Are you sure you’re all right?” Emily asked. “You sound a bit out of it.”', '“Work’s been crazy,” Kate replied. “There’s a case… I can’t talk about it now, but maybe when you get back.”', 'When she’d hung up the call, she sat on the concrete beside the pay phone. There was only one conclusion that made any sense now, but trying to acknowledge it was like trying to take control of an optical illusion. The cube needed to evert; the vase needed to recede into the gap between two faces. All along, she’d been confusing figure and ground. But she’d been right to believe that the people who’d fled their families had been the ones affected by disease; her mistake had been to change her mind. Because she had fled for the very same reason.', 'Kate felt her whole body shaking, as if she’d just clawed her way back from a precipice. Michael and Reza weren’t suffering from any kind of illness. Beth, Chris and Emily were all in perfect health. And whatever she’d been afflicted with, herself, she had to believe that it could be treated. She had to cling to that hope, just as she had when the roles had appeared to be reversed.', 'She staggered to her feet. She thought of calling Reza, to set his mind at ease, but she was afraid that if she heard his voice everything might flip again.', 'As she walked toward the bus stop, she pictured herself back in the emergency department—where she should have remained, as Reza had beseeched her to, all those nights ago. But once she was admitted to hospital, once the psychiatrists and neurologists were debating the cause and extent of her delusions, how seriously would any of her colleagues treat her testimony? How much of what she had actually discovered would they believe?', 'How quickly would they act to protect the families who were marked for the same fate as Natalie’s?', 'She couldn’t take the risk that they’d ignore her. She couldn’t run away and hide in a hospital bed while the righteous army rose up against the hollow ones, and the true believers honored those they’d loved by granting them peace.', '\\xa0', '“I’ve been wondering about something,” Kate said. She was sitting with the other runaways: Linda, Gary, Suzanne and Ahmed, huddled in a circle away from the merely homeless, who were hostile or agnostic when it came to their cause. “Exactly where did this disease come from? And exactly how does it spread?”', '“Does it matter?” Linda replied. “We know it’s spreading fast, whatever the route.”', 'But Suzanne was less dismissive. “It could be important. Did you have something in mind?”', 'Kate said, “My yard has a couple of fig trees, right at the back. And those fig trees are full of fruit bats. I don’t actually go down there and roll around in the guano, but our dog was doing that all the time.” She looked around the circle, hunting for any sign that this scenario, based on what she’d seen at Natalie’s house, might be describing a shared condition. “Remember the Hendra virus? It went from fruit bats to horses, then people. What if this is something like that—but with dogs instead of horses as the link?”', 'The group was silent for a while, then Ahmed said, “My dog was acting strangely for a couple of days before I left. But my wife had nothing to do with him; she wouldn’t even let him in the house.”', '“Do you have fig trees?” Kate asked.', '“No. But our neighbor does, and some of the branches hang over the fence.”', 'She waited, but no one else volunteered their own zoonotic risk profile. If the details didn’t match, why not say so?', 'Gary said, “In any case, we know it must be jumping straight from human to human now.”', 'Kate frowned. “What makes you so sure?”', '“Because of the speed,” Linda interjected.', '“But what exactly do we know about the speed?”', 'Linda was starting to lose patience. “My mother, in Sydney, was already affected the very same day my husband changed. I called her up to try to tell her something was wrong, and she was… gone.”', 'Kate nodded soberly. “It hit my sister, the same night as my husband and my son. But this morning…” She steeled herself, ready to find out the hard way if her own revelatory experience could sway anyone else. “I called a friend who’s been in America for the last two months—”', 'Everyone turned away from her to look across the warehouse floor, back toward the loading bay. A woman was approaching the circle. Her eyes were lowered, and she’d shaved her head, but as she crossed into the yellow light of the hurricane lamps, Kate recognized her by the shape of her face.', 'Her four companions rose to their feet, and Kate followed them. Each of them embraced Natalie in turn, and then Gary introduced her to Kate.', 'Kate shook her hand in silence. Natalie didn’t meet her gaze. The six of them sat on the tartan picnic blanket that Gary had spread on the concrete floor.', 'Natalie said, “It has to be tonight.”', '“Are you sure?” Gary asked. “Once we tip our hand, there’ll be no going back. And I still think I can get more recruits. Rowan’s gone missing, but he might turn up—”', '“No. We can’t wait any longer.” Natalie spoke calmly, but with a tone of authority. “We need to send a signal to all the people who are still unreachable. We need to let them know that they’re not alone, that there’s an army on their side, and an example they can follow.”', '“I understand.” Gary looked around the circle. “Is everyone ready?”', 'Everyone but Kate nodded, but Kate saw Ahmed glance her way uncertainly. If she gave him more reason to doubt, there might be a chance that she could break the consensus.', 'She said, “Please, can I share a story with you? It will only take a minute.” Forget Emily and her voicemail. She needed to cut closer to home.', 'Gary looked to Natalie, then said, “Of course.”', '“The night I left my family,” Kate began, “I was driving around for a long time, trying to decide what to do. Then I thought: I’ll go to my sister. She’ll help me, she’ll understand. I didn’t have my phone, so I couldn’t call her. But as I drove toward her house, as I got closer and closer, the more I thought about what would happen once I knocked on her door, the more certain I was that she’d already gone the way of my husband and my son. I ', ' she was exactly like them—without even seeing her, without even talking to her.', '“So I thought: I’ll go to my friend Chris. He lived much farther away, but I trusted him. So I set off south, heading for his apartment, glad I still had someone I could turn to. And the same thing happened. I never arrived; I never saw him, I never heard his voice. But I was absolutely sure that he’d been hollowed out.', '“What does that mean? Do I have some magical sense of who’s changed, that I can know that without even meeting them?”', 'Natalie said, “You made a guess, that’s all.” Her manner was growing brittle and defensive. She was an intelligent woman; she knew there was no intuition that could work like this, no presentiment that could be trusted in the absence of a single fact to guide it.', '“But the feeling was so strong,” Kate insisted. “As strong as when I saw what my husband had become, lying beside me in my bed. I never let him speak, either. I just ', ', because it was so clear to me. But now, if I’m honest with myself, I’m afraid that it wasn’t him who changed. I’m afraid—”', 'Natalie snapped. She started screaming, then she leaned over and began pummeling Kate with her fists. Linda and Ahmed took hold of her, pulling her back, but she kept shrieking and thrashing. Suzanne began sobbing, staring at Kate in horror, as if she’d just stabbed all five of her comrades through the heart.', 'Kate kept talking, sickened by the cruelty of what she was doing to a woman already annihilated by grief, but determined to finish the job for the sake of anyone still tempted to follow her.', 'She said, “I’m afraid I’m the one who changed. The dog dug around in the bat shit, then she got sick, and I let her lick my face. ', ' face, not my husband’s, not my son’s. I thought they’d lost everything that made them human, but now I know that it was all in my head.”', '\\xa0', '“Surprise!” Reza called out from the far side of the visitor’s yard. He was holding a child in his arms.', 'Kate approached them warily. “Is that really him?” As soon as the words slipped out, she wished she could take them back, but if Reza heard them as more than a figure of speech he did nothing to show it. “He’s grown so much,” she added.', '“Yeah. I’m fattening him up for sumo school.” He smiled and held Michael out toward her.', 'Kate hesitated, afraid that after so long he wouldn’t recognize her. But he gazed placidly into her face, and offered no protest when she took him in her arms.', 'They sat together on one of the benches.', '“That beard’s getting out of control,” she told Reza.', '“Ah, but you love it, don’t you?”', '“It helps.” The neurologist had suggested this trick, and it seemed to be working. The new Reza reminded her of the old one, just enough to invoke memories of him without raising her expectations too high, while she built a new set of responses to the way he looked now. Sometimes it felt wrong when she kissed him, like some sick game with twins, but if she had to choose between the old Reza being dead to her forever, or reincarnated in this imperfect look-alike, she’d settle for transmigration into a doppelgänger with a beard.', 'She turned to Michael, and he reached up and put a hand on her face. “Who is the most beautiful boy?” she asked. “Can you guess who that is?” He smiled, a little smugly, as if he knew he was being flattered simply from her tone. That seemed new, but she could love what was new. Everything that mattered most in his life was yet to come.', 'Reza put an arm around her shoulders, and she didn’t flinch.', '“The last scan showed no inflammation,” she said. “And there’s no more trace of the virus in my CSF. So maybe another week.

The Apollo missions had crews. The astronauts kept company, cracked wise, backed each other up. My kind would be alone in the dark. The world was watching, waiting.

My new body thrummed with latent power.', 'Time to write a new story.', 'When the countdown reached zero, I sent the thought to activate ignition. I applied the right amount of energy, the exact direction of thrust. I gritted my imaginary teeth and triple-checked the readouts as my velocity changed. Then I turned off the engines.', 'The moon’s gravity held me in stable orbit for as long as I desired. Craters dusted in abalone whites and grays filled my view in one direction. I watched the familiar contours pass by—Secchi, Mount Marilyn, the Sea of Tranquility—their names etched in my memory better than my own face. On my other side, the stars sang their vast, maddening, frigid aria, but I was safe in a lunar embrace. Safe enough to let myself sleep.', 'Blissful oblivion took me for the next twenty minutes.', '\\xa0', 'When the sun’s light warmed me again; when a cacophony of cheers filled my hearing; when my planet rose like a robin’s egg from a shadowed nest: then, I checked off one more item.', 'Text copyright © 2018 by SB Divya', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Jun Cen']}\n"

There are old weather almanacs, but past a certain printing they all run a woeful rut into the dirt: rising tides, rising dust, rising temperature lines the color of sunburn.

Change has planted it there, and she feels more change building where she can’t quite see it. Good things—crisps, soft beds, kindly aunties who keep your hair free of snags—can never ever stay when change is on the move. If it was a thing she could bite, she would bite it. If it was a thing she could throw rocks at, she would chuck pieces of flint until her arm fell off. But there’s nothing to do but wait for whatever is coming.', 'So she screams.', 'She shrieks into the canyon until the echo makes a pack of her, big and mean and capable of keeping things the way they are forever. She shrieks until her throat gets raw inside and the sun heats the ground beneath her enough to be uncomfortable. She doesn’t cry, because that’s a waste of moisture and she’s frustrated and angry, not senseless. But she yells. She even uses a few of the more interesting words she remembers from the walls of the gas station restroom while she’s at it. And it does make her feel a little better, eventually. Not much, but enough to ease the feeling in her chest.', '“They’ll never come back no matter how loud you call, you know.”', 'Another change: Auntie Martha is off the roof, right in the middle of the day. She lights a hand on Linnea’s shoulder, delicate but with a surprisingly strong grip.', '“No, they’ll never come back, little squab of my heart,” she continues in her gentle singsong. “The nest is scattered and the shell is crushed and in the case of your people, they did it to themselves. But it…it ', ' feel good to try, doesn’t it? You always hope something other than your own voice will fly back. And isn’t it always worth trying? Just in case?”', 'They’ve done their best, her aunties. There’s a gulf between them that no ship can cross, but they’ve tried very hard, and they love her despite her humanity. Linnea gropes for words, a shape to fold her feelings into. Her voice sticks like a rusted pump drawing up dust from an empty well.', '“If I call,” she says, “will ', 'come back?”', 'They watch the question drift to earth together. Auntie Martha sighs, soft as eiderdown, and wraps her arms around Linnea.', '“Oh, little squab. Little naked thing.”', '\\xa0', 'More passengers arrive—not just two-by-two, but in ones and threes and severals, all more or less shaped like human women. The radio crackles static, the horizon sizzles with heat, and the farmhouse fills with the noise of idle waiting room chatter. Figures with shadows like frogs and parrots and long-necked tortoises loiter on the porch, smoking and waiting for sundown. Some help Auntie Ben with what’s left of the ship’s construction, ', '. Others walk the halls at night, pacing with an impatience you can feel sparking off their soles like blue lightning. The air, Auntie Doris says, feels like a chick is pecking gentle-like on the other side, looking for the best place to lay into the world’s shell with its egg-tooth.', '“I still don’t see why it has to be a ship doing the cracking, though,” she adds, looking as disgruntled as she ever gets. “I don’t trust ships, even the kind that don’t go on the water. No telling what a ship will unleash, no no no there never is.”', 'Linnea tries to stay out of the way, but it’s hard when there are so many others around. She takes to sleeping on the roof with Auntie Martha, whose skinny fingers are an ink-stained blur now from sundown to first light as she makes her charts. ', 'goes the fountain pen, spinning delicate spider silk lines between stars. The house below them hums hot, creaky impatience in its sleep. Further out in the yard, listing in its scaffolding, the ship looms black and blue.', '“Nothing has an ending. Not really.” Auntie Martha says little while she works, which means she says little at all these days. When she does bother speaking, Linnea listens, hoarding every word against future silences. “Hatching is not the end of what lies inside the egg, only the end of the shell around it. There’s no flight without the shatter, and no flock without the flight. What we’re made of will go on. A fledgling in some other place and time will look up for guidance and maybe see the path we leave behind, even when all of this as it is”—she flutters her free hand at the darkened desert—“dries and blows away. Change is comforting, in that way.”', 'Linnea casts a wary eye at the night. She tucks her knees in tighter beneath her chin.', '\\xa0', 'Pretend you are the wind. Pretend you are the inhalations and exhalations of the land, the breath of tortoise and tree twisting windmill and grass blade alike. Some day soon you will kill everything you touch, spreading a mushroom cloud’s poison seed from desert to delta to distant island. Death will fruit as heedlessly cheerful as any invasive species mankind has ever sown, unconcerned with distance or climatological delineations, and the world will slowly return to silence. All the world’s a graveyard. Like the last soldier in some grim and cautionary fairy tale, you are tasked with whistling past its gates forever.', 'Soon—very soon, the thoughtful pause before a clock’s hand flicks to midnight—but not yet. Today there is still life, although it’s a scraggletailed, desperate kind of thing, struggling to grow through a coating of red dust. You blow past caravans of ragged scrabblers, towns and communities clinging to civilization like cubs clutching at a dead mother’s fur. You sweep through pockets of memory and unreality. Ghosts and grit tumble down empty highways. Sometimes they clump into things with form and will; old spirits crossing an older landscape, psychopomp trompe l’oeil. The border here is very thin. History overlays it all like a second skin, a hidden shape the eye has to unlearn everything to recognize. See the beast with stripes like a cat and jaws like a wolf? See the glaciers that carved the horizon? See the people who lived here before, their homes and their handprints, the blood they spilled in the sand?', 'Old roadsigns rattle and dance as you pass. Junk food containers whirl. Beside the long black scar of the highway is a gas station.', 'You pause to brush the little girl’s bangs back from her face. She’s lost in concentration, momentarily distracted from hunger by the task at hand, sunburned forehead creased. Her hands work the old candy bar wrapper into triangles, pyramids, arrows, flaps and furrows, halves and planes. An alchemy of geometry, transmuting garbage into a kind of escape.', 'At last she finishes her spell. It sits stately in her palm for a moment, a crinkled paper bird smudged by dirty fingerprints and time. She lifts her hand to you as you pass and you take the little gift, touched by the gesture.', '“Goodbye,” she says. You keep on moving as always. The paper bird soars. “Goodbye.”', 'The farmhouse is at full capacity, as full of visitors as it can manage—restless bodies crammed cheek-to-jowl, wood-and-brass chests of varying sizes stacked in corners and jammed beneath beds. Linnea isn’t the only one who sleeps outside now. They spill down the porch and into the front yard on rude pallets, shaking sand from their ears and hair when the brassy bright mornings come. It’s very hard to avoid their eyes; there are so many of them, and they are all so watchful of her two-leggedness. The ship—finished, Auntie Ben says, as it’ll ever be, and as it’ll ever be will do just dandy for their purposes—strains at the sky. The nights grow cold and brittle.', 'Linnea lurks around the edges, hugs corners, and spends most of the days remaining with a fist-sized knot churning in her stomach. The passengers move their trunks and their bedding to the foot of the ship. The farmhouse deflates a little. The knot in Linnea’s stomach stays the same; deep in her heart she knows what’s coming, although not one of her aunties says a word. When their chests finally vanish from the bedroom as well one afternoon, it’s almost a relief. Three square holes in the dust at the feet of the three neatly made beds, hardwoods darker there than their surroundings. Like shadows burned into pavement, or the white chalk outline of a hand on blood-red clay.', 'She has no trunk, no locked box with her name on it and her true skin inside. Her shadow is nothing if not honest. It drags at her heels as she walks—no running this time—down to the gorge. There is no memory of being left behind in her head, but there is a feeling, and it has all the contours of something well-worn and familiar.', 'Someone is already at the canyon’s edge when she arrives. Big, broad-shouldered, gray-haired—Fatu. Linnea thinks about leaving. She thinks too loudly and too slowly, and Fatu notices her. Linnea waits to be ignored, dismissed, or snorted at. Fatu’s never had time for anything much other than working on the ship, and no time at all for a human child, no matter how beloved of her hosts. After their first meeting Linnea had done her best to stay out of Fatu’s way. Up until today she had proven pretty good at it, too.', 'Instead, Fatu wordlessly waves her over with a blocky hand. They sit together in silence, big and little legs dangling over the gorge’s lip. To their left the sinking sun is an angry, infected red.', '“They lied about my kind when they first saw us. Dumbest damn thing.” Fatu doesn’t take her eyes off the horizon as she speaks. Her voice is a rumble Linnea feels in the unmapped interior of her chest. “This was Wayback, before cameras or jeeps or automatic weapons or any of that sort of shit. You know how many horns they said we had, when they sent word back home? Or where they said we had them growing ', '? Some peabrain blinder than my grandam drew a picture, and that picture, it grew some legs. It ran far. Soon everybody thought the lie was truth, all on account of one silly, stupid drawing. Nobody there to correct them. Nobody around to tell the true story, and it wasn’t as if we could speak for ourselves.” She halfheartedly flicks a pebble into the chasm. “Lies are like ticks. If you have no birds to pick ’em off, they breed, and they suckle, and they turn your world sickly. Your vastness shrinks. Your skin gets thin and pale. Soon, all you’re left with is…unicorns.”', 'Fatu spits this last word from her mouth like a nettle. She chews on her bottom lip for a moment, brow furrowed, nostrils flared. Linnea waits.', '“A unicorn is a fine fiction,” she continues, eventually, “but it isn’t ', '”', '\\xa0', 'On the final night, they build a fire in the ship’s shadow. They open their chests—their trunks and their suitcases, their valises and chiffoniers—and they tell stories.', 'A dark-skinned woman with green hair and curved lips is the first to unlock hers. Inside is a cloak covered in emerald feathers, neatly folded. She pulls it over her shoulders with an eye-dazzling flourish. In the darkness between blinks—in the waver of heat off the bonfire—she melts and changes. Now she is a green and red parrot, perched on the trunk’s open lid.', 'Her audience leans in.', '“I was a hundred,” she says. “I was a million, although I did not know what million meant. Our forests were as green as our feathers, and just as numerous. The fruit was sweet, the chatter of my flock sweeter. ‘Silence’ was another word we did not know the meaning of, and we were happier for it. Loudest of all those millions was my mate. There was no nut her beak could not shatter. We raised many clutches together, fine and strong and shrieking.”', 'She lets that picture hang in the air: a green place filled with the screams of a happy, prosperous people, wings flashing in the dapple. Linnea, who has only ever known red dust, cannot see it no matter how hard she tries.', '“They cut the trees down, one by one, and my people soon followed,” she finishes. “Those hills are bare now. They know the meaning of silence.”', 'A pause, and the parrot flies into the fire. Only her shadow emerges from the flames. It flaps into the high scaffolding surrounding the ship, lands, and waits.', 'The next to step forward is sharp-faced and angry and almost as short as Linnea herself. She yanks her furry brown hide from inside its chest—no nonsense, no pause for dramatic effect. A blur and a noise like teeth clicking together and a shrew glares up at the crowd with eyes like glass splinters, daring interruption.', '“THE SONS OF BITCHES PLOUGHED UP MY BURROWS!” she yells. If her body is small, her voice is more than loud enough to say what needs saying. “THEY BUILT APARTMENTS THERE! APARTMENTS! GOOD RIDDANCE TO THE LOT OF THEM! I HOPE WHAT’S LEFT OF THE BUNCH ENJOYS THE MISERY THEY’VE MADE!” She shoots Linnea a triumphant, bitter look and stomps one of her little feet for emphasis before skittering into the flames. Her tiny shadow is swallowed up entirely by the ship’s massive one.', 'There are stripes on the cheeks of the third, and an expression that says she’s never dabbed makeup over them and might sooner cut off her own head than entertain the thought. She holds her chin high as she changes, higher still as she speaks. Her voice is a razor wrapped in velvet.', '“They took my forest,” she says. “They took my prey. They took my people’s skins. Not ', ' skin, but that didn’t matter too much in the long run, now did it?” Her tail-tip swishes. “Their fear was deadly enough, but their admiration was what crushed the windpipe. There’s nothing worse for continued survival than their wanting to be like you—to touch you, to possess you. Once they get it into their heads that you’re ‘special’…”', 'The tigress shakes her head disgustedly. She stalks off to meet her fate.', 'One by one they stand and have their say. One by one the cluster of shadows beneath the ship’s bulk thickens. Scale and fin, feather and fur. A woman with black and yellow hair and a voice like many voices buzzing together. Leather-faced, leather-skinned aunties with slow-spoken, toothless mouths. Enormous Fatu. The fire takes them all, changing them, and their stories are all different and yet, at the heart of things, all the same. Linnea watches with growing apprehension, fear coiling inside her. She cannot decide which is more terrifying: walking into the fire or being left out of it.', 'The sky lightens. The group thins. Three left: Auntie Ben, Auntie Doris, and Auntie Martha. Linnea wants to cry out ', 'but something solid seems lodged in her throat.', 'Auntie Ben goes first. With a fond, wry smile, she retrieves her skin. A long-jawed, rangy thing, neither wolf nor tiger, with stripes on her ragged flanks: that is the true shape of Auntie Ben.', '“I’ve told my story about as often as anyone cares to hear it,” she says. “We were strong and swift and lived freer than scrub seed. Men came. They did what men carrying guns do. Just to add insult to injury, they stuck the last of us to die in a bloody concrete cage as a way of saying ‘sorry.’ I’m tired of blathering on about that, though. If it pleases you all—hell, even if it doesn’t—I’d rather never think about it again. I’d rather kick sand over this dead place and head for the stars, where other somewheres might be in need of fur and feathers and sharp, smart jaws full of teeth. Chicks leave the nest and joeys leave the pouch. It’s just about time for all of us to do the same.”', 'She doesn’t step into the fire. Not yet. Instead, she pads across the open space, stripes rippling across lean muscle. She keeps on coming until she’s so close Linnea can smell the dusty musk and fur scent of her. It’s a wild reek—which makes it slightly unnerving—but it’s also Auntie Ben, which makes Linnea abruptly sob and fall forward to hug the rangy creature around her rough neck. Auntie Ben allows the mauling, good-natured as always.', '“I know you’re afraid of changing, little one,” she says softly. “Your people never were any good at it, and you’ve seen how that turned out. If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say that’s why you’ve got no skin of your own, poor naked mite.” A long pink tongue flicks out to touch Linnea on the cheek. “But whether you go or stay, change is coming for you, and it can either be the one you choose or the one you don’t. Which is it gonna be? Think you can manage the trick?”', 'Linnea tries to say yes. She tries to mean it. But the fire and the unknown behind it and her fear of both (she’s so afraid, she can’t help it, her knees are shaking and they won’t stop) turn her attempted “yes” to a lie, and the lie clots sour and solid so that not a word can get around it. Auntie Ben watches her struggle, unable to offer help or assistance or meaningless, soothing words that might also be lies.', 'Gently, firmly, she pulls away and steps back.', '“It’s up to you,” she says. “We’ve done all we could.”', 'The creature Linnea knows as Auntie Ben turns and trots into the fire. Her shadow gives Linnea a final featureless look over its shoulder before taking her place in the crowd of shades.', 'Auntie Doris comes next, as serious and wide-eyed as Linnea’s ever seen her. A click of the lock and a snap of the hinges and here’s her own true self: a thick-beaked, long-necked, goggle-eyed bird with a fat, squat body and wings more like suggestions than anything approaching useful appendages. She takes a look at herself—the stout legs, the powerful claws—and chuckles fondly.', '“Round as an egg, round as an egg, bless my bottom feathers. And what better way is there to be? Flight isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, no no no. I see plenty of them’s got that power standing in the ranks, and you see how well that served ', 'They’re passing on through the fire, same as I.” A firm nod of the bulbous head. “I admit to mistrusting fire. When the men came to our lands they carried it, and I can still remember the smell of all my aunties and uncles and cousins a-roasting over it. But they’re all gone now, and so are all those hungry, hungry men. Nothing left but my poor Linnea, and we raised her better than all that, didn’t we, girls?”', 'She waddles closer. Linnea hugs her as well; soft feathers over surprisingly hard muscle, like a silky, affectionate fireplug.', '“You learn things, being so low to the ground,” she says. “You learn to be sturdy. You learn how to appreciate the earth you’re planted on. Nobody ever knocked ', 'down with any club! If I settled my bottom, it was always my own decisioning. That’s important. Whatever you do, you just remember that, love. You settle your bottom where and when you feel like it. We’ll understand if the fire is too much to ask, but oh, we ', 'miss you.”', 'A final affectionate butt of the head, a long, fond look, and away she goes, at as stately a pace as one of her kind can muster. She flinches at the fire’s edge—remembering those earlier fires, maybe; the dogs and the rats and the hungry sailors—but only for a moment. Auntie Doris is stronger than she looks.', 'Auntie Martha’s trunk is lined with yellowing maps of the stars, and the feathers of her cloak are the slate-and-peach of the pre-dawn sky. She settles on Linnea’s shoulder with a whistle-whirr of wings.', '“We were more like your kind than all the others, in our way,” she says, close to Linnea’s ear. “So many of us we blotted the sun and stripped the branches. But we exist to learn, and to change in the learning, in the hopes that some day we may find ourselves changed enough to tell our stories and tell them honestly, no matter how much that may sometimes…sting. Then we can become something else, and fly on.” Her claws dig through the thin fabric of Linnea’s shirt. “I am uncomfortable with all this talk of decisions. There’s nothing wrong with needing more time. Hatchlings grow their feathers when they will. Do you feel your people are ready to have their story told?”', 'Linnea looks at the shadows and the rocket. She stares into the fire. All she knows is potato crisp wrappers and garbled voices on the radio. The aunties gave her love, but in their love they neglected many things.', '“There are some things that cannot be taught, only learned,” Auntie Martha says, as if hearing the thoughts rattling around in her head. “That was not our story to tell, little fledging. We’re ghosts, and you are still alive, but we love you, and that makes the letting go hard. No one—not even those you care about, neither I or Ben nor Doris—can or should force you into a change you aren’t prepared for. It has to be your own decision, in your own time.”', 'She fluffs her feathers and rubs her head against Linnea’s cheek.', '“Remember our stories while you learn your own,” she whispers. “I left star-charts for you; they’re in the bedroom in a box beneath my bed. I carry my own in my head, the same as my people always have.” A note of pride. “Catch up when you’re ready, and no sooner. Be good. Remember we love you.”', '\\xa0', 'Shades marching two-by-two onto a shadowy ship—shadows of tiger and thylacine, dodo and dingo, elephant and sharp-horned rhinoceros. They hop and fly and pace up the gangplank in silence. The fire beneath them dies to embers as the light in the east grows and the last disappears inside, the rusted old hatch slamming shut behind them with a ', 'Nothing happens, at first. Then there’s a slow rumbling from within the rocket’s guts, a rust-rattling, bolt-testing shudder that grows and grows and grows until the entire ship and all the ground around-abouts it are shaking like a penny in a tin can. The first red rays of the sun set fire to the scaffoldings and fins, the soldered seams that patch the scavenged eyetooth-length of the thing together. Orange dust rises like smoke. The long, pointed shadow at its base jitters faintly.', 'The ship begins to topple over. At the same time, its shadow pulls itself free of the dusty ground, ascending with a noise like a hurricane wind made up of the calls of every animal to ever creep or crawl or flap or low, a joyous, cacophonous menagerie. It lifts higher and higher, charging to meet the dawn as, far below, the ship collapses completely. The air is full of sand and twigs and old litter picked up by the whirl—candy wrappers, plastic bags, feathers. Chunks of scaffolding tumble-bang to earth end-over-appetite, adding their own clattering boom and roar to the morning as the shadow pulls away. It is a cloud—a bird—a mote swimming across the eye—and then it is nothing at all.', 'The triumphant menagerie song fades to an echo. A trick of the wind, occasionally interrupted by another piece of the ship’s struts coming down with a tooth-rattling ', '.', '\\xa0', 'Every morning she gets up and brushes her own hair, makes her own bed. She eats a breakfast of whatever she’s scavenged the previous day. There are no potato crisps, but the aunties taught her long ago all was left that could be plucked, pecked, swallowed, or snapped. If the weather’s good, she takes the pickup out looking for pieces of story—diaries of neighbors, scraps of old newspapers, history books. If it isn’t (and frequently it isn’t; the storms grow worse as time spreads like a puddle), she spends her afternoons huddled in the root cellar, thinking about everything she’s learned.', 'She watches the seasons turn until there are no more seasons, just days, hot and identical when they aren’t memorably violent. She outgrows her clothes and takes new ones from the abandoned town. The kitchen radio coughs dry static for a little while longer before dying completely. One night the sky dances with cloudless lightning the color of blood, a crackling red net stretching from horizon to unseen horizon. The next morning the pickup won’t start.', 'From then on Linnea walks everywhere she needs to go. She wears out every pair of shoes the town’s got left and then her feet get as hard and tough as everything else in the dying world.', 'Old warnings unheeded, predictions shrugged off, smokestacks belching into the sky. ', '. She learns new words.', 'With the pickup broke down, food gets harder to find. Linnea’s ribs are a ladder leading directly to her throat. She dreams of the tastes of all the good things she’s ever eaten—canned corned beef, a soda she found in a vending machine once, the beloved and well-worn potato crisps. She dreams of constellations with stars like stripes along their flanks. She dreams of an airship, a low-swung thing with a sagging canvas belly above and a wooden deck below.', 'When she wakes from the last, she has a blueprint in her head. She’s no longer hungry or thirsty. She has all the energy in the world, a mind overflowing like a rain bucket with stories.', 'Auntie Martha might’ve said, pleased. ', 'Saying goodbye stripped Linnea of her fear. Once the worst comes to pass, what else is there to fret about?', 'Now all her energy focuses on building the airship. It becomes an obsession. She gathers old sheets, pulls the curtains from the bedroom windows, raids houses and boarded-up hotels for their linens. She stitches them all together (', ') into a giant patchwork bag. It gives her no free time to spend missing the aunties or thinking about food. She sits cross-legged in sandstorms with her needle and thread, head down, turning quilts and blankets to wings. She no longer feels the sun on her back or the hot wind in her hair. All that’s left is determination.', 'The farmhouse loses its clapboards. The airship gains ribs and struts and a sturdy wooden basket in a cheerful, peeling yellow. Propellers are pried off fishing boats that will never see water again. There are parts of the construction that Linnea cannot recall clearly the next day; a dark spot in her mind’s eye and the patchwork bag is stretched and nailed firmly over the frame and she has no memory whatsoever of how it got there. A feeling of finality builds. It pushes everything else out like a cat expanding to fill a sunny windowsill.', 'A night comes when the moon is as full and fat and yellow as a disc of dry bone in the sky. Everything is spilled ink and ivory. The airship squats near what’s left of the original rocket, waiting for Linnea as she steps out her front door. Not a sigh of wind disturbs the becalmed world. It’s as still and breathless a night as she’s seen in an unreckoned amount of time—a listening audience, a girl waiting for a bedtime story.', 'Or a conductor waiting for someone to fish out a ticket. She’s got no skin but her own to draw on; humans traded their stripes for words long ago.', '“We weren’t very good at this,” Linnea says to the darkness.', 'After going so long without speaking or hearing another voice, the sound of her own voice lands like a teacup kissing concrete.', '“The man who built this house used to hit his wife. He died a long time ago, before the aunties moved in, but I still know that somehow. I know a lot of stuff now. I know all the things I learned and all the things I didn’t.” Linnea lets her gaze wander over the familiar front porch landmarks—the abandoned wasp nest in the shadowy upper left corner, the pillars sandblasted down to bare, dried wood. She thinks she sees movement out of the corner of one eye. A dark bipedal shape beneath the airship’s bulk, an absence of moonlight clinging to memories of alarm clocks and apple pie. Another joins it, then another.', '“I know why me and all those other kids were living around the gas station,” she continues. “I know where all the grown-ups went. I know why they went there, and why they never came back. I know why they stopped talking on the radio, and it’s all…', '. Nobody would listen to one another, not even to the people they loved. Maybe they weren’t scared enough. Maybe they were scared of the wrong things. They didn’t have Auntie Ben and Auntie Martha and Auntie Doris to teach them about stuff and they wouldn’t have listened anyways, but…”', 'There are so many stories buzzing inside Linnea’s head it’s hard to hold on to the frayed length of her own thoughts. She gropes and pushes aside other people’s memories until she finds the end of it again. The little cluster of flickering shadows around the airship’s hull is thicker now. The patchwork bag shudders and stirs with a faint hiss.', '“We weren’t very good at this,” she repeats. “And we took everybody else with us. But we weren’t all bad. We had potato crisps, and ice cream, and we built farmhouses and wrote songs and told stories. Maybe next time will be okay. Maybe we’ll turn into something better at changing once we fly.”', 'There is a noise—a rising wind, a thousand whispers, a sliding of fabric and a slither of inflating canvas. The horizon in the direction of the abandoned town seems to ripple.', 'Linnea steps off the porch into the moonlight. She strides across the yard, vaults the fence, and doesn’t stop until the shadow of the rising airship reaches out to swallow her own.', '\\xa0', 'Pretend you are the land—the empty sea-lapped cities with their blank skull eyes, the blasted green glass wastes, the skeletal forests. The desert, as red and uncaring as ever. Do you feel the shadow cutting a nightjar’s swoop across your foothills? Do you see the airship that throws it, nosing noiselessly across the face of the moon?', 'Ghosts rise to meet the vessel, sinuous as smoke and blue as pilot flames. They cluster thickest over the cities, but even in the empty parts of the world there are always a few hurrying to catch up. The airship moves with the graceful, unbothered patience of a whale hunting for krill. It is a black mouth with a belly big enough for all of humanity, filtering souls from a night that seems endless. No need to rush, it whispers, but even in extinction humans are terrible at altering their old habits.', 'It takes forever. It takes no time at all. It crosses all the whens and wheres, all the should-have-beens and never-wills. Whoever or whatever stands at the wheel has a steady, tireless hand. The gathering goes on for exactly as long as it needs to, until there’s nobody else left to claim. The moon sets and the stars rise; so, too, does the airship. It sets a course for a constellation shaped like a long, lean predator, distant flickering suns dotting its purple flanks like stripes.', 'Drifting gently upward', 'distance shrinks its size, taking memories of telephones and coffee tables and radio broadcasts along with it. First kisses, last breaths, friendships and fallout and fires blossoming on the horizon—they dwindle and dim, going back to the darkness all thoughts and stories come from. A final pulse of ancient light from a dead star—red-blue-green—and there’s nothing left to see and no one left to remember they ever saw it.', 'Pretend you are the land.

When an alien walks into a human kite maker’s store, coveting her kites, the human struggles with her guilt over her part in the alien massacres, while neo-Nazis draw a violent line between alien and human.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'You’ve never seen a kite fly until you’ve seen an alien fly one. Dragonfly wings on their backs trembling with anticipation, these deep sighs from their purple mouths as they’re unrolling the spool. They run with their slow, spindly legs to let the kite pick up speed. When the diamond of cloth is let loose from their skeletal hands, you can see their armored shoulders strain to rise up with it. As the diamond dips and rises on the string, you can hear these great yips, then these wavering trills and the desperateness of their song, how they want to be up there. There were thousands of them at the park the other day, and I swear to god I cried hearing those songs ripped from thousands of alien throats.', 'A few of them try to hide this surge of emotion when I put the kite in their hands. Tove was like this. First time he came into my shop, he tried to keep his eyes closed, his black eyelids flickering with the effort. He walked in pretty stiff for his kind, pushing his skinny feeler legs barely out in front of him, like he was sneaking in on tiptoe. But the little hairs on those legs bristled, and finally, he flicked open his black lids.', 'Can I help you? I asked. I never knew what to say around them. It seemed like everything I said was wrong, loaded with some hidden meaning I didn’t intend. I still remembered the moment they first arrived, their spaceships burning through the atmosphere like comets, like falling angels, and how we’d surrounded the ships in horror, aiming for their thin legs with anything we could find, because the rest of their bodies were armored but the legs snapped like pencils. I had done these things myself, when the boys were small, out of fear, but there was no taking it back now. The ease of killing was just so natural to us from when bugs had encroached on the territories of our houses. Now the aliens kept my shop afloat, seeing as they were the only ones who wanted the antique toys I dealt in. These days all the humans wanted were tech-gadgets, anything with the hint of looking alien, a taste of the exotic. Kids weren’t even flying remote helicopters anymore, not even drones. Now you could roll into a suburb and the kids in the front yards would be flying around mini Dragonfly Arks, playing at intergalactic war, the losers crashing down into the home base dirt patch they called Earth. Kites, spinning tops, these were ancient toys for kids these days, more alien even than the Dragonfly tech we’d dragged out from the ships before the aliens could start fighting back. Teenagers were covered in Dragonfly tattoos and alien symbols.', 'Tove inhaled sharply, his Dragonfly body puffing up for a moment. He looked around my dusty shelves of wooden and metal toys. Miniature trains, yo-yos, weathervanes, carved boxes, maracas, tin soldiers. The pegged wall of kites, bright and colorful like those old collector’s rooms of dead butterflies stretched open to display their wings—this was the only wall he didn’t look at, as if he was infinitely aware of where it was.', 'I am Tove Who Battles Photons, he said in the strange way they always announced themselves, his voice flickering in and out of human range.', 'Anything you need? I said.', 'He said, A wooden top. Maybe a kite? Or a game of the dominos?', 'I used to be able to scalp them for all the technology they could spare just for the kites. Since, they’d learned to feign nonchalance, but a good antique dealer knows the market. I led him straight to the kite wall, the sailcloth breathing with the breeze he’d let in.', 'Tove scanned the price tags and shook his head. Maybe not, he said in that gravely voice.', 'I knew what they did for money. Because their wings and legs were built for gravity and atmosphere thinner than ours, they didn’t move fast, couldn’t fly, were unsuitable for heavy lifting. Jobs like construction and fieldwork were reserved for humans. But their hands, their fingers were so nimble, so thin and skeletal they swished through our atmosphere like singing blades. Needlework, precision jobs, diamond cutting. They would do all of this for less money than our most meaningless jobs. They slept in giant warehouses that companies had built for this purpose. But everything they made felt strange, built for another world. Cloth rasped in a way that felt hollow to our ears, jewelry they’d cut reminded us of scales instead of gold. Alien-made. All the brawny, tough-man jobs were sources of human pride, if you could have them. In this way, I was more like the Dragonflies than the humans, my craft something that had become disgusting to most people, a sign of weakness.', 'I heard people passing on the sidewalk outside. I held my breath. Sometimes I got a hard time from angry groups who still weren’t pleased that the aliens had landed, no matter how many of us were won over, no matter that there was no decent way to get rid of them. A group of anti-miscegenation skinheads had been roving the strip, and it wouldn’t be the first time they came in my store. I’d had bricks thrown through my window a few months before.', 'But the footsteps passed.', 'Next time, I said to Tove, exhaling.', 'It wasn’t about the money. It was about pride in something I’d done, about art. I’d made each kite with my own hands, thread and needle, stick and lathe. I dyed the cloth myself into tapestries that could be seen from the ground. It wasn’t that they couldn’t make their own kites or that there weren’t a few other holdout kite makers. The Dragonflies sometimes made them out of paper bags and twigs. Sometimes they even made them out of scraps of nylon they’d quilted together, stolen from the factories where they worked. But the alien craft makers reflected their own predicament in everything they made. These clunky, makeshift things flew poorly; they only reminded people of how stuck we were on the ground by their gracelessness. Mine were art, the aliens told me, they were more than the sum of their parts. Mine had the lift, the weightlessness that made you feel like you could rise up there with them, the kind that dragged your heart up by their string. They told me it made them feel like they were back home, like they had never been stuck here, like thousands of their own kind were still family-swarming around their sun. Dragonflies dropped into my store often, like moths to light. Profits went up. Now, I could make the kites as big as I wanted. I had one as big as a hang glider in the backroom. Eight hands would have to hold it at once to keep it on the ground.', 'I went to return the kite from his hands to a wooden peg on the pegboard wall. I brushed his feeler hands as I did, the millions of hairs on his black fingers tickling me. I felt my face go hot. I knew I’d done something wrong instantly.', 'Tove withdrew his thin arm as if he’d been burned and said nothing. He left the store in the same tiptoeing way he came.', '\\xa0', 'I went home to my human-made house in the suburbs. In the dusk, I always half-expected another ark to fall, the parabolas of broken ships littering the sky. But it had been fifteen years since they arrived, more since they first headed for earth, their home world eaten by a red giant sun, only enough fuel and years to reach the closest habitable planet, break their ships open like eggs in the atmosphere, and never return. Now, when I rolled into my driveway, the kids roamed the neighborhood playing humans and aliens, hitting each other with electronic wands that dissipated on contact so that no damage could be done. We didn’t have any aliens on our side of town; the children considered weak played the aliens, eyes big, offering no resistance. If they fought back, they were scolded, ', '.', 'I closed my car door. Mini-ark toys floated above my head, dipping around me as they fought and crash-landed in a sandpit. My boys seemed to have outgrown those games. They sat around the kitchen table watching holograms instead of homework.', 'Help me with my bags, I said, and it took them several seconds before they shifted to indicate they’d heard me.', 'My oldest, Aleo, brought in my bag of nearly finished kites I would work on later that night and tossed them in the corner of the kitchen without looking. He had a disdain for the things. Nobody at his high school wanted to look like poor alien kids, who were always flying kites and never wore clothes, only tiny threadbare baby shoes that protected the ends of their delicate legs from the pavement. Of course, no human would ever be confused with being an alien, of looking like a Dragonfly, but you might be confused with looking poor, and sometimes that was almost as bad. We weren’t poor exactly, but no matter how much money I made off of the kites, we weren’t rolling in it.', 'Benon hugged the paper sack of groceries. He was wide-eyed, and I knew he was bullied when Aleo wasn’t around.', 'How’s the schoolwork coming? I asked as I threw broccoli into a pot.', 'What’s cooking? Aleo asked without looking up from the hologram he’d started watching again.', 'Benon held his nose. I didn’t make any excuses for my cooking.', 'When we sat down to eat, Benon said, About homework…', 'Shoot, I said.', 'I have a history report. It can be about anything.', 'I froze. I knew what he would say before it was out of his mouth. Of course he would, always playing the alien in the neighborhood games.', 'I want to write about the Fallings, he said.', 'I pressed my lips together hard. Aleo shoved more food in his mouth than I thought it was possible to swallow. Something black flashed from under Aleo’s sleeve as he reached for more food. I grabbed his hand and pulled up his sleeve. What is that?', 'Nothing, he said, yanking his sleeve back down again. But I’d seen it. Alien script: the swoops and careful circles, the spheres with the arrows shooting out.', 'Is it permanent? I said. Do you even know what that means?', 'Aleo mumbled something.', 'Benon said, Mom, you were there at the Fallings. You ', ' it.', 'So did your brother. Aleo, what does it mean?', 'I don’t remember ship, Aleo said. I was only a few years old.', 'What does the tattoo mean? I insisted.', 'Aleo slammed his fork down. It means Aleo Laughter in the Air.', 'I snorted. Laughter in the Air? Really? Can you even read it?', 'He didn’t answer.', 'Mom, Benon whined, I want to know what it was like.', 'I didn’t say, ', 'It changed everything, I said.', 'I got up from the table. I was no longer hungry. I shut myself up in the backroom for the rest of the night, turning a group of sticks smooth in the lathe. One thick, long branch was earmarked for the large kite. When I picked it up, it felt just like the weight of a baseball bat, the only weapon I’d had when I’d headed to the first Arkfall. I swung it in the air, the heft just right for making contact.', 'In late summer, the skinheads started setting fire to some of the shops that catered to Dragonflies. It was illegal, and also ridiculous. The world would change without them whether they wanted to or not. But a bakery down the street that had hired a Dragonfly to decorate the cakes had burned to the ground.', 'The skinheads were already on the wrong side of history, but it only made them cling harder to old hatreds. Some groups were angry because the Dragonflies were taking up resources, others because they’d taken their jobs. Others were staunch on no human-Dragonfly love. Our species were so different we couldn’t procreate together and the religious zealots claimed that without the sanctification of children, the union was unnatural, disgusting. Bestiality, which was a sin. Religious pundits who were horrified at what they’d done tried to justify our cruelty by saying the Dragonflies had no souls. Some of them believed that the aliens were playing a long con, coining the term: ', '\\xa0', 'It was months before Tove walked into my shop again. I wouldn’t even have recognized him—I had a hard time differentiating them—except he had that strange way of walking like he was feeling his way around a cage. The bell tinkled, and he tiptoed in again. From Benon’s history report, from which he walked around the house spewing facts, I knew that their religions focused on the legs as the expressions of the body. The rest of their bodies were so rigid, but the legs could curl like delicate antennae. If they could express their souls, it would be through the way they walked.', 'We’re closing soon, I said. I hoped he did not remember my touch.', 'Tove’s top antennae drooped.', 'But if there’s something I can do? I said.', 'He tiptoed through the aisles of shelves, ended up at the kite wall like I knew he would. I hopped off my stool. He set his fingers to glide across the sailcloth of the cheapest kite, a red one that pictured the deserts of Mars. I could tell it wasn’t his favorite. His eyes, remarkably human, roved all over the wall.', 'There was one on the bottom shelf that was my own favorite, painted mostly blue like it would melt into the sky. A big no-no in the kite trade; amateurs stuck to reds and oranges, colors that would be easily seen in the clouds. But I was an artist and hated rules. I wanted the kite to blend in. I wanted the kite to look like a ripple across a mirror, like a great tide welling up under the surface. It wasn’t the cheapest, but I was determined to see it in the sky. I always made my customers take their kites across the street to the park. I told them it was to verify that they were satisfied, that the kite worked. But mostly I was watching them, trying to understand the alien emotion that racked their bodies as they let it loose.', 'How about this one, I said picking it up.', 'He purred from his throat, smashed his eyes shut against the blue.', 'It is not for me, he said. I would have to ask.', 'Who is it for? I asked.', 'My sons, he said.', 'Benon had informed me that the Dragonfly women gave all of the material gifts to the offspring, so I knew something must have happened to Tove’s mate. If the thing happened fifteen years ago, I did not want to know. My own mate had left me around that time, for another woman across the country. It made you realize you didn’t even know yourself, he’d said, that we didn’t even know who we’d become. He wanted to start over with someone else, with this new understanding. He said, as he closed the door softly for the last time on me and the kids, How can you love like that, not knowing what’s inside of you?', 'I hadn’t argued.', 'I’m sure they would love it, I told Tove. These sell quickly, so I can’t promise to hold it.', 'It is about choice, he said tersely in his accent. His voice sounded like a bad radio, wavering in and out. Their own language was spoken on a frequency that sounded to us like silence and hums.', 'Benon had told me that back on Sadiyada, none of them gave orders. If a shuttle-full of Dragonflies were about to drive over the cliff, the passengers would say, ', 'rather than ', ' or ', ' They believed in pointing out what was there rather than compelling action. When they had realized their sun was about to engulf their planet, they merely built the ships, let anyone who wanted board the one-way ticket, the ships that would fall apart on atmospheric impact, and the others just stayed behind, burned up with the sun. Sons, mothers, lovers, all of them separated, and no matter the love between them, not a one would beg, ', '. They just waved goodbye.', 'And then they got here, and they were assaulted with demands. ', 'I pressured them all. I can’t imagine the shame, on top of everything else I had caused.', 'I nodded to Tove, who put my favorite kite down to look at another. Choose whichever you’d like, I said, a demand disguised as a choice.', 'Two teenage voices began yelling outside the store.', 'I pushed Tove quickly into the back workroom. He screeched softly, his hairs smashed down underneath my palms. Stay here, I said, and don’t come out until I tell you. Tove said nothing.', 'Trust me, I pleaded. I had to leave him there, stuck among my half-finished projects and the cardboard boxes.', 'I got to the front counter before the bell tinkled, before bald heads rushed into the room, the baldness a physical refusal to be like the Dragonflies with their million bristling, feeling hairs. They blew in with chants of ', '!', 'Any bugs in here? the leader asked.', 'No, I said quickly. I stared them down. I recognized one of them, an older girl that Aleo had brought over once after school. Then, I thought she’d been nice, shy, had always called me ma’am. The baldness was new, her scalp paler where hair used to be, and it made her look alien herself. I could tell she recognized me too, the way she wouldn’t meet my eyes, and she hunched her shoulders and tried to melt behind one of the others, a burly man with a sweatband around his forehead.', 'Lady, I could have sworn, the ringleader said.', 'See for yourself, I said. I knew it was best to let their anger wash over the store with the least provocation. I had called the cops before, and I knew from experience that they waited until any damage was already done before appearing.', 'They looked around the store without moving. Their eyes settled on the kites. They knew who my customers were. They started to poke through the racks, the dusty aisles, the afternoon light arriving in golden, violent streaks to illuminate what even the best of us were capable of.', 'The girl I recognized pushed a display case weakly, so that it tottered but didn’t fall. One of them brushed a row of yo-yos onto the floor. Another was heading in the direction of the workroom door. The burly man with the sweatband picked up the kite Tove had been looking at, which he had dropped on the floor. I kept eye contact with the girl I recognized, who finally looked up and caught my eye.', 'Nothing here, she said.', 'The burly one with the kite handed it to the girl like it was evidence to the contrary. The girl looked at me, snapped the wood of the kite. She ripped the cloth in a struggle of arms.', 'Shoddy work, she said, tossing the flail of broken kite, the spine akimbo. She led them out of the store. I could hear them whooping on their way down the street to the next establishment.', 'I picked up the broken kite and put it behind the counter. I spent a moment picking up the scatters of wooden yo-yos, just in case they changed their minds and came back.', 'When I finally opened the door, Tove was under the giant hang-glider-sized kite that took up most of the ten-foot room. His shape under there flinched when he heard the door open.', 'I’m sorry, I said. You can come out now.', 'He moved the giant kite off and nodded.', 'I held my hand out to help him, but he stood up slowly by himself, his legs curling heavily under his weight, the air pushed from the flutter of his wings tickling my hands. A breeze when there was none.', 'This one, he said, pointing at the giant kite. This is the one I want.', 'I had painted it with a mosaic that looked like stained glass, so when it flew, it was like we were inside some great cathedral where we were supposed to pray. Like we were stuck here, underneath its great glass, but our spirit was supposed to rise somehow anyway.', 'How much? he asked.', 'I understood Tove, wanting the biggest, best thing you couldn’t have. I wanted his unexhausted hope, that’s what I wanted. I wanted forgiveness without having to name my sins, I wanted tenderness to feel real to me again. Some part of me wanted to fly in the face of everything those skinheads represented, but another part of me wanted the world before the Dragonflies fell in, the world we couldn’t have. Were we tender before? Could we be tender again? Or did the Fallings only awaken the violence we’d always had? Benon had informed me that the Dragonflies were so fragile, all those hairs on their legs and arms and feelers, all those thin appendages, that they were so careful with each other when they loved, that they barely even touched. Love making was mostly an act of foreplay, their wings manipulating the air around the loved like a cyclone sending all of their hairs and feelers singing with touch. It was like being loved by the air itself. Even this was left wanting from Earth’s atmosphere, their movements clumsier now, the work so much harder on them. But human lungs! We had always been clumsy, but we had more lung force than their wings had now. Instead of answering Tove, giving him the price of a simple kite, I pursed my lips and whistled air in his direction.', 'Oh, he said, eyes closing. Oh hemena. His throat buzzed.', 'I whistled again, pushing air across his face in the circular pattern Benon had described.', 'Oh, I feel unarmored, he said. Oh hemenalala, I am defenseless.', 'It was like I was pummeling the words out of him, he said them that painfully. I knew he wanted to say ', 'He wanted to say ', '. Were those nicknames he had given his fallen mate? Was he trying to call her ghost back across the years? But it was my name I wanted on his purple lips.', 'I blew all the way around him to the back, where his four wings trembled, my breath blowing their wing-dust off until they shone translucent. Had he still been able to fly, stripping his wings of their powder would have been even more cruel. Benon had said that their wings were electric colors in the home atmosphere, but in this one they had turned a dusty brown. Now they were drab ghosts of what they used to be. Benon had never told me what came after, what consummation was for them. Had I known, I would have done it. I know I would have done it.', 'Oh hemenalala, he said as I made my way back to his front, where his thorax armor glistened and tensed.', 'Finally I stopped, held my breath.', 'When Tove was finally able to compose himself, I couldn’t look at him. I said, the kite isn’t finished. Come back in a month.', 'He didn’t answer me and he didn’t turn around. His eyes stayed closed the whole way out of the store.', '\\xa0', 'A few weeks later, I went home to a Dragonfly in the backyard, the neighborhood kids around him with their electronic sticks. Even the older kids were out, excited by the new development. What’s going on? I said.', 'Ask Benon. Aleo shrugged.', 'He’s for my project, Benon said. I asked him to come home with us.', 'Are you fine with this? I asked the Dragonfly kid.', 'I’m cool, the Dragonfly said.', 'The Dragonfly looked at me and popped gum from his tiny, pursed mouth. I waited for him to announce himself the way his kind did. It was hard to tell their ages, but this one must have been born here, was already starting to lose the customs of his parents.', 'Finally, I asked him, Who ', ' you? more combatively than I would have liked.', 'I am Yeshela Whisperer of Mist, the child said begrudgingly.', 'Wonderful, I said, and went back inside.', 'I was not against the kids mixing, unlike other parents I knew who were prying their blinds open to watch across the block. It’s just that I didn’t think the kids were ready. Not after I’d seen what we’d done as adults. But I was willing to bet against myself. I left them to it and pulled aside the curtain.', 'They were reenacting the Fallings again, which the Dragonflies called the Arkfall Massacres but we did not. Benon sat atop our old swing set and was directing. It seemed like this time they were trying to get everything exactly right. They even had a giant hologram of one of the Arks cracked like an egg projected behind them in the sandbox. Benon was reading the history out loud.', 'Thousands died. We didn’t know what they wanted. When they crawled out of their broken ships and picked themselves up out of the crashes, we were sure they were invading, they wanted our children, they wanted more than we could give. We defended our earth. We aimed for their thin legs, their eyes, their delicate fingers. In our city, a ship crashed into the main fiber optic tower. It wiped out most communications, and city officials were too panicked to fix it. Other cities made other mistakes. We couldn’t call each other directly, and so everything we knew about the crash that boomed into the city at dusk, the other arkfalls across the world, was through a rumor mill. Was the National Guard coming? Were they too busy with other arkfalls? Were there too many of the ships to defend against? How many of us could they kill before we reacted? By sundown the next day, we were at the crash site with any weapon we could find.', 'The neighborhood kids were making the Dragonfly kid crawl out of the hologram. Then they had a line of them stand off with their e-sticks. Benon knew I was watching. He couldn’t help but flick his eyes in my direction. That kid always had the uncanny ability to know when I was looking, unlike Aleo.', 'Benon directed the neighborhood kids to approach and demand what the Dragonflies wanted. ', 'Benon kept pausing the action to ask the boy what he felt, what he would have done if he’d been there.', 'The moment came I was dreading. The boy, as directed, stood up slowly, testing the thick, heavy atmosphere. He put up his thin arms to shield his eyes from the alien sun. Benon said, ', ' The humans approached, sticks raised. The boy’s wings fluttered, an unconscious reaction, trying to fly away, even in a game, finding this atmosphere a noose to the ground—just like his parents did, then. Had he been like us, he would have yelled for the humans to stop', ' The e-sticks flew at him, whaled on him, and went for his legs. The e-sticks worked as they were supposed to, dissipating into gas upon contact. The blows weren’t hurting him. Aleo had once flung one at me in a childish rage, and the dissipation had only felt like the strangest whisper. The boy closed his eyes at the feeling of the sticks passing over him, his sensitive body hairs moving through the ghosts of a long-dead massacre. Benon looked at me, it seemed, for approval, his eyes asking, ', 'I closed the curtains. A spray of police lights flashed past the window. Someone must have called the cops when they heard a Dragonfly boy was in the neighborhood.', 'I opened the curtains again. Yeshela was cowering on the ground, trying not to move, lest he hit the handles and fists holding the e-sticks, which would not dissipate. The humans were still going, their joy at having their game more lifelike than it had ever been before like a drug. How could they know what they were pretending to be? For them, it was just a story. They never got to the point of horror, the point where we were sorry, when the tide turned, after we wanted them to surrender in the human way, arms up, after we wanted them to fight back to absolve us, after we realized they could not be pushed to fight back, when we began to carry them into the hospitals and the morgue, the doctors trying as best as they could to understand our differences, how to get under their armor, how to splint antennae together, where the vital organs were.', 'I burst through the screen door. Stop, I yelled.', 'Mom, it’s a game, Aleo said.', 'A game, I scoffed. Do you know where I saw your friend, that nice girl you brought over once?', 'Aleo shrugged. I hadn’t told him.', 'The cop car parked across the street.', 'I’m taking you home, I said to the Dragonfly boy.', 'I loaded Aleo and Benon and the Dragonfly into the car. The boy directed me to a side of town I’d avoided since the city had changed. The three were silent the whole way. The streets changed from suburbs and people walking their dogs after work to cheap construction warehouses in a maze of driveways, deserted. In our city, they had been installed in old complexes of customer fulfillment warehouses. In other cities, they had been pushed into condemned and rotten buildings at the center. In others they were given cloth FEMA tents. In others they were given nothing and wandered from public park to public park.', 'The warehouse the boy pointed me to was almost as big as one of their own ships. A cluster of them gathered around the industrial complex. At the gates of the warehouse, I parked, pushed my boys out. You’re going to apologize to his mother, I said. Benon hung his head.', 'History makes no apologies, Aleo said, repeating something he’d heard in a bad hologram, winking at Benon.', 'The Dragonfly boy did not say, ', 'Instead, he said, The warehouse is not a place you’ll like. My mother will not like this. We are far in the back.', 'Which did not deter me in the least.', 'A smaller door had been cut into the giant loading dock door. Inside, the old product shelving stacks had been repurposed into bunks, layer upon layer of bed spaces where as many as four or five of them slept at a time. Whole families of Dragonflies curled into each other’s bodies. We stepped over standing water on the concrete floors, the smell of mold, flies swarming in clouds. There were dragonfly feeders hung up on the long scaffolding—I mean actual dragonflies, the tiny earth kind, which the aliens hatched from eggs and studied. There was no electricity, no running water I could see. Just rows and rows of bunks, each bunk bed like a tiny home, some decorated with my own kites and wind catchers, wind chimes, feathers, mechanical fans.', 'When we reached the bunk the boy said was his, his mother climbed down, buzzing. She didn’t announce her name because it was her turf, not mine, but I didn’t give her my name either. I pushed my boys in front of me.', 'I’m sorry, they chimed in unison.', 'For what? asked the mother.', 'They— I said. We—', 'He wasn’t hurt, I finally said.', 'I don’t understand, she said. She chattered to her son in their own language, the hums and silences, and he sullenly responded, his legs curling and making him sink in stature.', 'I wanted to run back the way we came, past rows and rows of these broken families, but I made the three of us stand there in penance.', 'The mother turned her head back to us. She said, I think forgiveness means different things in our language. We do not ask for it.', 'We were silent, rebuked, our heads hung.', 'I’m sorry we make you sleep here, Aleo said. It’s so horrible.', 'For a moment I was proud. I would have pointed out every failure in the warehouses so the boys would learn how much we had.', 'Then the mother said, It’s our home. She turned away from me, bundled her child’s legs up and lifted him, laboring slowly up the ladder in the heavy atmosphere.', '\\xa0', 'That night, I put my sons to bed for the first time in years, checking on them in the bedroom they shared before they turned out the lights.', 'Benon was still chattering about his history report, how he could use what he’d learned.', 'Please, I said, don’t do that again.', 'Aleo rolled his eyes, turned over. Benon gave a large sigh. I was afraid for them, my kids, for what they would discover about themselves, for what they wanted to be but would soon discover they couldn’t. I tried to hold them both, one arm in each bed. Aleo shrugged me away, Benon stayed rigid.', 'Mom, we don’t need you, Aleo said.', '\\xa0', 'Weeks passed. Tove did not come back. I wasn’t expecting him to. Where would he get the money? And after what I’d done. Benon got an A on his history report, the note from the teacher saying, ', '. The skinheads came again into my store after another one of my customers, who was able to slip slowly out the backdoor. Benon was still spouting Dragonfly facts routinely, like, ', ' and ', 'Apparently, they too had stories about arks, wandering through deserts, how many of them would fall when they got to their new home. Aleo got another tattoo, this one a poor translation of a command which they had no word for, ', '.', 'One afternoon, just before closing, I heard people yelling outside my store, saw the lighters flick on the other side of the frosted glass. I ran outside.', 'What do you think you’re doing? I yelled to the group that had gathered, the same group of skinheads that had plagued me with Tove. I meant to distract them with words, I meant to drain the fervor out of what they were doing. I meant to inject them with the moment I had years before, when I dropped my bat. But the aliens hadn’t fought back, had waited until we’d made a ruin of them.', 'The leader said, Stay out of the way and you won’t get hurt.', 'The lighters were licking strips of cardboard. I thought of how much money was inside that store in wood and cloth, what I would lose. I let my temper loose. I started yelling, calling them the curs of the world, disgusting creatures, more animal than the bugs, not fit to inherit the earth. I spat because I’d seen it done in holograms and at some point my words failed me.', 'The girl who had been Aleo’s friend, now confident and grown into her role, said, Lady, I wasn’t even born when they got here, and I didn’t even have the chance to do anything. What did you do when they came? You’re just like us.', 'That was before I knew, I said.', 'And now we know what we are, the girl said. You’re just pretending.', 'The rest of them chanted. ', '. ', 'The cardboard strips touched the storefront. They all stepped back.', 'There ', ' more than one way, I said. I rushed forward, trying to put out the flames with my shirt, but the flames seemed to glow and leap up brighter with every swing and fan of my shirt. I yanked open the door of the shop, burning my hand on the doorknob, and ran inside.', 'Inside the shop, you could barely hear the crackle of the fire. I was panting. I stopped. I looked around at the shelves, the kite wall illuminated orange from the flames outside the window. Did I want to let it burn? To let everything I had done in conciliation disappear, burn up, leave no trace? For any guilt I had to disappear, to be forgiven by flames?', 'And then I smelled smoke. I snapped out of it, ran in a craze pulling kites down off the walls, rushing back and forth to my car parked out back, dumping everything I could and going back inside. One of the kites caught on the doorjamb, the cloth tearing like muscle, the frame snapping like bones, like legs, like antennae, a feeling I remembered. In my memory I stood over a Dragonfly, arms lifted to protect a small one. I left the baby, but I killed the mother. We were methodical in our frenzy. Dragonfly after Dragonfly, if they moved, if they didn’t move, if they made sound, if they were silent, we killed them. We were afraid. I was afraid.', 'I pulled all the kites down off the wall before the flames reached inside. I pulled the giant kite out of the backroom, the frame still heavy as a baseball bat, the cloth still fragile as skin.', 'I started driving. What did I have left in the world? My sons, my kites. The certainty of moving forward and beginning again. My fear. I wanted to scream. For a moment I let go of the steering wheel and let the car drift over into the other lane. Another car was coming down the roadway like everything in our world was normal. Then I thought of Aleo and Benon and jerked my wheel back.', 'I drove my car in circles. I was like a sleepwalker. I don’t even know how I got there; eventually, I ended up at the Dragonfly warehouses.', 'Inside, I asked, Please, does anyone know Tove Battler of Photons?', 'They bristled, and too late I realized I’d said his name wrong. Long black antennae-like fingers pointed me to another warehouse, down corridors, up racks of bunks. Then I found him lying on a third-floor bunk, eyes closed, his sons chattering in their mother tongue beside him.', 'Tove, I said.', 'He sat up.', 'I did not say, ', ' or even ', '. I said, My store is burning. There is something outside. It is for you.', 'He stared at me for a good while. Did he hate me? He could have lain back in his bunk. Instead, he labored down slowly. He waved his antennae at his sons, and they followed at a distance.', 'There were tears sliding down my face. Why didn’t you defend yourself, I asked. Why?', 'He led the way outside, tiptoeing as if walking towards a dangerous secret. Finally, he said, Wouldn’t you have killed us all, if we had fought back and lost? You have books that say only the weak will inherit the earth. In our prophecies, the only way to stay was to not fight back.', 'I didn’t mean fifteen years ago, I meant in my backroom, but this answer was as good as any. I said, But why did ', ' not fight back?', 'I wanted to live so badly, he said. For the first time I noticed seams on his legs where they must have been broken before, the source of his strange tiptoe walking.', 'And if you inherit the earth, what would you do with it? I said.', 'Silent, he waited for me behind the trunk of my car. A crowd of Dragonflies gathered behind us to see what this human woman wanted with one of their kind.', 'I opened the trunk door, passed out the kites I’d saved. Of what use could they possibly be to me? I handed the end of a rope to Tove, two others to his sons. I had five other rope ends that I passed out. Each was one piece of the giant kite.', 'This wasn’t charity; this wasn’t forgiveness. How could it be, after all that I had done, was still doing? I wanted to fling it in their faces, what they had lost. I wanted to see them hurt for that sky, sing for that lost planet. I wanted them to sing my own song and break open with it.', 'Then Tove led the eight of them forward, began running slowly with their curling legs. The kite, the sky over them as oppressive as my fear. All around me I heard gasps and yips, long protracted vowels, what they called their home planet in their own language. They moaned as the hang glider went up, that cathedral shard taking off above us, begging us all to rise.', 'Text copyright © 2018 by Brenda Peynado', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Chris Buzelli']}\n"

Among the doctors and nurses of a clinic-turned-fortress, Kath is coming of age in this new world, and helping define it. But that doesn’t make letting go of the old any easier.\\xa0“Where Would You Be Now?” is a prequel to the novel ', ', a finalist for the Philip K. Dick Award.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Kath sat on the roof of the beat-up Tesla S, legs draped down the back window, shotgun in both hands, looking out into the dark for whatever might hurt them. They’d come forty miles or so to an encampment in what had once been a park with a picnic area and duck pond. A playground with a plastic slide and jungle gym was still intact, though weeds came up through the bark mulch footing. A collection of trucks and campers clustered here, circled together with space for a campfire in the middle. The fire was banked now. Some tents and lean-tos had been set up a little further out, along with a couple of rickety sheds. In summer, people didn’t need much more shelter than that. Winter, the camp would pick up and move south, if they could get the gas for it. Getting hard to find gas, though. The place was starting to look permanent. One of the trailers had a chicken coop built next to it, and a couple of roosting chickens were visible, feathers plumped out. The camp probably housed about thirty, but this late, everyone had gone to bed.', 'The packed-dirt mounds of four graves were lined up outside the circle of campers. The doctors didn’t ask about them, the ones they couldn’t help.', 'Turned away from the light, Kath kept watch. Nothing around the area moved. No one seemed inclined to charge in and grab such a valuable commodity as a doctor.', 'They’d parked the Tesla next to a medium-sized RV, from which came the groans of a woman in labor. Only this box of a room was lit up with candles and lanterns. The waiting and noise of effort made the air thick. The tenor of the groans had changed over the last twenty minutes, becoming more urgent, and also more exhausted. Kath could try to peek in the door, at the woman tucked up on her cot, straining. But she just listened.', '“You’ve got this. One more push.”', 'That was Melanie’s voice. Did Dr. Dennis have her handling this delivery? She usually assisted him.', 'One more loud groan, then came silence. Kath held her breath until a tiny wail sounded, the new baby successfully announcing itself. A ruckus followed, the handful of people in the RV talking over each other, making admiring noises.', 'Unless something went wrong in the next little while, which could involve anything from the mother bleeding out to the baby showing some kind of illness or injury, Dennis and Melanie would wrap up and they could be on their way. Might be smarter to wait until dawn to make the trip back to the clinic. But the road between here and there was still passable, and Kath wanted to get home.', 'The light from the open door changed as figures stood in front of it. Dr. Dennis was standing with the thirty-something bearded man who’d summoned them here that morning. Dennis was giving him instructions.', '“We’ve still got vaccines lying around. Bring her to the clinic in a couple months, we can give her a good start.” The man, presumably the father, nodded with a distracted air. Leaning forward a bit, Kath could peer through the doorway and catch a glimpse of the camper’s interior. The new mother was there, nested on a narrow couch, sweat matting her hair to her face, sheets tumbled around her. Melanie was helping her bundle the new baby against her skin, probably explaining everything she could about nursing in a handful of minutes. The mother didn’t look up at what Dennis was saying.', 'They might or might not bring their baby to get her shots. They might decide they had bigger problems than worrying about measles or whooping cough.', 'Dr. Dennis came down the aluminum steps and paced a moment, hands on hips, looking into the night air. “Everything okay?”', '“Yeah. No trouble,” Kath said.', '“Good. I want to get out of here as soon as we can.”', 'So he was on edge, too. The unfamiliar settlement, the warm thick night, might draw out people they didn’t want to talk to.', '“You okay, Doctor?”', '“Six months. I give that baby six months, based on the condition of the rest of the camp. It’s so goddamn pointless.”', 'Dennis and the other doctors at the clinic went over the statistics all the time. Without proper nutrition, clean water, medicine, without so many little necessities, infant mortality spiked. And there didn’t seem to be anything they could do about it. If they were in the area, maybe one of the doctors could come out to vaccinate. Or maybe the parents really would bring the baby to the clinic.', 'The man returned to the door and handed over a threadbare pillowcase, half-filled. “Here. It’s what we can spare. Thank you. Thank you for coming.”', 'Grimly, Dr. Dennis took the makeshift sack by its bunched-up neck. “You’re welcome. Just keep her as safe and healthy as you can, right?”', 'Dennis took a quick look in the sack, which Kath knew would be filled with canned goods, maybe some wire or screws, some glue. Odds and ends. Whatever salvage the parents thought worth the doctor’s attention. Barter. Dennis used to get paid thousands of dollars for delivering a baby.', 'He looked up. “Kind of a weird question. Do you have any golf balls?”', 'The man pursed his lips and shook his head. “No, I don’t think so.”', '“Well if you find any, maybe save them for me?”', '“Yeah. Yeah, sure.”', 'Two other women came to the doorway to look out. One of them was pregnant, maybe five months. She seemed worried, brow creased, lips tight, hands laced over belly. As if she could use her fingers to cage her unborn child to keep it safe. The other woman looked tired.', 'Dennis frowned at them. “You all aren’t using any birth control at all around here, are you?”', 'Both women cringed, and the man crossed his arms. “Not like we can pop into Walgreens for condoms.”', '“It’s just… never mind.”', 'The man added, “I mean, so many people have died—don’t we need to think about repopulating—”', '“Oh Jesus fuck, ', '! Look, repopulating the planet or whatever can take care of itself. You—you just worry about keeping the people you already have safe and healthy. ', ' Grow some fucking potatoes!”', 'For just a moment the man’s glowering gaze hardened. He was thinking of trouble, of taking the doctor down a notch for the outburst. Kath straightened, shifting the shotgun on her lap. To show she was watching.', 'He backed off. “We’re trying, here. We’re ', '”', 'Dennis sighed and came around to the other side of the car to wait for Melanie.', 'She emerged a moment later, shrugging the strap of an equipment bag over her shoulder and pushing a strand of black hair out of her eyes. She looked the most tired of all, even more than the mother, who at least was smiling when Kath glimpsed her.', 'Kath hopped off the car and opened the back door. “You okay?” she asked.', '“I think so,” she said, sighing. “Doc made me handle the delivery on this one.”', '“How was it?”', 'Melanie shook her head, her eyes widening in a look of half-panicked disbelief. “It’s a lot different when the baby is falling into your own hands. I just kept thinking, God, don’t drop it.” She closed her eyes and sucked in a breath. “I hope everything stays okay.”', 'Kath touched her shoulder. “Let’s get out of here.”', 'Melanie practically fell into the back seat, and Dennis started the motor and pulled away. Kath rode in the front passenger seat. Literally shotgun. That had stopped being clever a while back. She kept the window rolled halfway down and listened for the sound of approaching engines.', '“You did great,” Dennis said, glancing at his assistant in the rearview mirror. “You should have asked them to name the baby after you.”', '“No, that’s okay. What’d they give you?” She went through the bag, to the sound of cans knocking together. “Eh, not bad. A couple boxes of nails. We can always trade that back out. Canned peaches.” She paused, looked quizzical, and drew out a glass jar. “Capers. There’s a jar of capers in here. They’re organic.”', '“Organic capers,” Dennis snorted. “We’re saved.”', 'Dennis kept the headlights dimmed to save the battery. If there’d been enough moonlight, he’d have shut off the lights entirely. But the roads had gotten too hazardous, full of potholes and debris, to risk going entirely dark. Still, the doctor didn’t see the three kids standing in their path.', '“Stop!” Kath screamed when she realized those shapes weren’t odd shadows but children, one older gripping the hands of two little ones, there in the middle of the road, unmoving. Like they intended to get run over.', 'The car lurched to a stop, skidded a few feet. The bag of loot fell clattering to the floor, and Melanie braced herself on the seat. Kath was already out the door, with Dennis calling after her.', 'The kids stared back at her quietly. Their eyes were sunken, their cheeks hollow. It could have just been odd shadows cast by the dim headlights, but Kath didn’t think so. They were hungry, starving. She scanned around for an adult, maybe a caravan they might have wandered off from. But they seemed so purposeful, the way they looked back at her, their eyes round and shining. They didn’t seem lost.', '“Hey, what’re you guys doing here? Are you okay?” She tucked the shotgun under her arm, muzzle down, and approached them.', 'The older child looked like a girl, stringy brown hair in a loose braid, her eyes big and unblinking. Kath thought she was around eight, then revised up—ten, and malnourished. The other two might have been anywhere from two to five. Upright, but still uncertain in their movements. They clung to the older girl, gripping each hand and hugging her legs. All three wore t-shirts and loose pants. Only the oldest had shoes, dirty sneakers, toes poking through holes.', 'Kath inched closer, trying to look friendly and harmless even with a gun under her arm, but she stopped short of reaching out. Both Dennis and Melanie had left the car as well.', '“It’s okay,” Kath said softly. “We’re not going to hurt you, I just want to find out what’s wrong.”', 'The oldest child licked her lips. “She told us to stand here. She told us to wait for the doctor to come and then go with him to the clinic. She said you’d take care of us.”', '“Who? Who said?”', 'Her lips pursed, the girl didn’t answer. Kath thought she was about to cry, but she just kept staring, any kind of emotion, any response, locked up.', 'Kath tried again. “Where’d you come from? From the camp back there? From somewhere else?” It had to be the camp, to know that they’d be driving back this way.', '“She just said to wait here. She said you’d take care of us.”', 'How did they know that? How could they be sure? Could have been anyone that came along the road here, and the girl seemed to know it. She was trying to be firm, to be confident. But her lip trembled, and her grip on the little kids’ hands was white-knuckled. She might have known just how dangerous this was, trusting in the good will of strangers.', 'Dennis had gotten out a flashlight and panned it around, scanning broken-down buildings and debris-strewn streets in all directions. No movement, nobody watching, nothing. Whoever had abandoned the kids here had fled.', '“We need to get moving,” Kath said. She was the guard on this run, but Dennis was in charge. It was his call.', '“Jesus Christ. Okay, fine. Everybody in the car.”', 'The littlest one started crying. At what in particular, Kath couldn’t say. Maybe it was just general exhaustion. She could understand that.', '“What’s your name?” Kath asked.', '“Chloë. These are Tom and Dakota.” She sounded relieved. Her shoulders had lowered a notch.', '“I’m Kath. Let’s go.”', '\\xa0', 'The two little ones fell asleep as soon as the car doors closed, and Kath marveled. How trusting, to climb into a car with strangers and somehow feel safer. This was a different set of rules than what she grew up with. The girl, Chloë, sat in the middle of the back seat, arms draped over both little ones, staring straight ahead.', 'Dennis drove with both hands on the wheel, clenched. Melanie also fell asleep, not looking at all peaceful. She was going to have a good cry later, Kath was sure.', '“Where would you be now?” Dennis asked after a long stretch of silence. His profile was shadow.', '“Hm,” Kath said. “College. Maybe I’d be at a party. Getting drunk? I dunno.”', 'His smile brightened his voice. “Getting in trouble. Sounds good. I approve.”', '“Maybe I’d be studying for a test. Would it be exam time right about now?”', '“Naw, you should go to the party. Have some fun.”', '“Where would you be?” she asked in turn.', '“Palm Springs. The back nine at Indian Wells. With a Corona in the cup holder of my cart.”', '“Golfing in the middle of the night?”', '“Well, no, not golfing right this minute. But I guess that’s where I’d rather be. I suppose that’s cliché, the doctor who’d rather be golfing.”', '“You think it’s still there? The golf course?”', 'He shook his head, a scrap of movement in the otherwise still night. “Even if the grass hasn’t all died it wouldn’t be getting groomed.”', 'They drove on a little while, tires crunching on pitted asphalt.', '“I wish you’d had the chance to go to college,” he said. “Even just a year or two. I’m sorry.”', '“It’s okay,” she said, because it was what she always said. The entire concept of college was becoming abstract.', 'Her older brother Eddie had gone to college. He’d gone back east, and that’s where he’d been when it all fell apart. She wondered what happened to him. Would always wonder, and it was maddening, not having any way to find out. Maybe even now, five years after his last call, before the power went out, he was still trying to make his way across the country like he said he would. Maybe he’d made it as far as, say, Colorado. Gotten caught in the mountains in winter. Maybe he was just resting. Maybe he’d found a safe place to stay, like the clinic here. Maybe they needed him, so he stayed. How long did it take someone to walk three thousand miles, anyway? She didn’t have any idea.', 'She left a note for him back at the house. Stuck it to the door, covered it with packing tape so it would survive wind and weather. Maybe he’d find it someday. Maybe he’d find her.', 'They rolled back to the clinic at dawn, when the sky was gray and chilled. Jim was keeping watch on the north side this shift, rifle tucked under his arm, perched on one of the derelict trucks that made up the barricade around the compound. Kath sat up on the edge of the open window and waved an arm high, giving him plenty of time to spot and ID her and the Tesla. She could see him shade his eyes to look out. He waved back and started to open the gate.', 'The car’s charge was just about finished. Eighty miles round trip was at the far end of its range these days; its battery didn’t hold as much as it used to. They might need to start rethinking trips like this. Or figure out how to bring solar panels along for a recharge.', 'A couple of others had come out to help Jim move aside the flatbed trailer stacked with twisted wreckage that served as the north gate. They could move it in and out easy enough, and then use chains and locks to anchor it to rebar loops sunk into concrete pits in the ground. As soon as the Tesla was inside, they shifted and locked the trailer back into place. Dennis rolled the car to a stop in its spot in the back of the clinic, where its charging station was, hooked up to a roof full of solar panels. That had been an epic bit of engineering, to get that all situated. The clinic was the only spot for twenty miles around that still had electricity.', 'Maggie must have been waiting for them; she came out the front door as soon as the car stopped. “How did it go? Everyone okay?”', '“Bouncing baby girl,” Dennis said, climbing from the car and stretching his back. “They gave us capers. We can resurrect fine dining.”', 'The other doors opened; Melanie herded out the children. Chloë was carrying the youngest propped on her hip, asleep.', 'Maggie was a middle-aged woman, tanned, brown hair growing gray, tied up in a bun. She wore a wrinkled blouse, jeans, and workboots. Kath looked at Maggie and saw her own mother, who’d been dead for five years now. Maggie and her mom had been friends; hard not to see her as some kind of stand-in. Kath hadn’t wanted to leave home. She’d been waiting, as if her parents might come back. As if Eddie might find her there, and if she left, maybe he never would. Likely, she’d be dead now if Maggie hadn’t made her come to the clinic.', 'Maggie stopped and gaped, looking among the adults for explanation. “What’s this? Who’re they?”', '“Found ’em on the road,” Dennis said, casually, like this sort of thing happened all the time.', 'The older doctor’s mouth opened, horrified. “We can’t… we don’t… we don’t have enough food! We can’t take care of any more people!”', '“Were we supposed to just leave them there?” Kath asked.', 'Maggie put her hand to her forehead. Her mouth had sunk into a deep frown. “No, of course not. It’s just… God.” She turned and walked off, scratching her hair.', '“Come on,” Kath said to Chloë. “We’ll get you set up inside.”', '\\xa0', 'Kath had them wash faces and hands while she heated up a can of beans to feed them, and made them each drink a glass of water and take a few chewable vitamins. They still had a couple bottles left, and this seemed like a good use for them. After that, the kids curled up on a cot in one of the exam rooms, all three of them together, snuggled under the blanket Kath had tucked them in with despite the heat. Maggie watched from the doorway, arms crossed, clearly unhappy. But she hadn’t really been happy ever, the last couple years.', '“We couldn’t just leave them,” Kath insisted.', '“And we can’t keep taking in strays. We had to throw out those potato plants on the east side of the building. Rot got them.”', 'They weren’t strays, Kath thought. They’d been dropped off. People were going to start leaving babies on their doorstep. And the clinic didn’t have enough food. “We’ll try again,” Kath said, because what else could she say? “We’ll figure it out.”', '“Yeah, I know, I know. You should get some rest, okay?” Maggie ran a hand over Kath’s hair, something she’d been doing since Kath was five.', 'Kath smiled grimly, double checked that the shotgun and its spare shells were locked up, and went out to the row of tents lined up along the clinic building. She hadn’t really thought about being tired until Maggie mentioned rest.', 'Kids and doctors slept in the clinic building. Everyone else used the row of tents, some old-fashioned canvas jobs, a few nylon domes, everything in between. Kath used one of the canvas ones, with the flaps tied up during the day to let in air, mosquito netting in place to try to keep out bugs.', 'Melanie was already inside, stripped to tank top and panties, sprawled face down on the sheet-covered mattress. If Kath was tired, Melanie was probably flattened after the night she had. But Kath paused a moment anyway, to see if she was really asleep. Admired the curve of her shoulder, the slope of her back where it arced to her hip. Melanie had the most amazing, artful shape to her.', 'Quietly, moving slowly, Kath pulled off her own dusty, rank clothes, then sat with her journal, squinting in the dark to write a handful of words about the image of those kids in the road, the nerve-wracking groans of the woman, the sticky-hot night air. These days, she mostly kept the diary out of habit, and her handwriting had turned tiny, scrunched—trying to conserve space, since she didn’t know when she’d ever find another blank book. She figured she’d keep writing until she ran out of space.', 'Kath tried to be quiet, but Melanie woke up anyway. “Hmm?”', '“Sorry, didn’t mean to wake you,” she said.', '“Hm, s’okay, c’mere.”', 'Kath set aside the book, collapsed onto the mattress, and Melanie gathered her into her arms. They clung to each other, body to body, and Kath’s near-constant, watchful tension from the night melted a couple of degrees. The scent of Melanie, the soap-and-sweat of her, the warmth of her skin, made Kath feel a little drunk. Melanie shifted, brought her mouth to Kath’s, and they kissed, a little desperately. Melanie sighed, like her own tension was finally fading.', '“You okay?” Kath asked.', 'She squeezed her eyes shut. “We’re going to be back there in two years helping that same woman deliver another baby, there’ll be twenty babies running around that camp and they’ll all be starving—”', 'Kath hugged her. Melanie shuddered a moment. Trying not to cry, unable not to cry. Kath didn’t know what to tell her.', '“That’s optimistic,” she said finally.', '“What?”', '“That any of us are still going to be around in two years.”', 'Melanie pulled away and stared at her a moment, then busted out laughing. They fell together in another tight hug, conveying powerful comfort. Anchoring each other.', '“Where would you be now?” Kath whispered.', '“Med school. I wanted to go to med school.” She laughed, but the laughter turned to crying, like it often did. She didn’t try to hide it this time, and Kath held her till she fell back asleep.', '\\xa0', 'Just a year or so into their time camping out at the clinic, a fire flattened the strip mall on the other side of the street. Could have been anything that started it, from a leaking gas line and static build up to lightning. Some traveler tossing a lit cigarette. With no one to fight the fire, it burned walls to the ground, collapsed roofs, and kept going. The few shade trees spaced out on the sidewalk went up like torches, and folk at the clinic stayed up all night stomping on ashes and dumping water on hot spots to keep the fire from jumping the road and claiming their home. The barricade of derelict cars, trucks, and trailers had already been put in place by then, but after the fire died down they hauled, towed, and wrangled the barricade another fifty feet out, and added on to it, to increase their buffer zone. To increase the perception of safety. They also spent six months demolishing buildings up and down their own street. Took a long time, clearing all that space with sledgehammers and controlled burns, but it gave them great line of sight after. And more space for gardening. After security, gardening was their biggest preoccupation.', 'It had only taken a few years for the entire character of that street, the neighborhood surrounding the clinic, to change. When they sat around at night, drinking whatever bottle of booze turned up, and asked how this could happen, they only had to look around.', 'The next day, after stopping by the kitchen tent for a cup of water and an apple, Kath went on her daily walk around the barricade. She usually did this in the morning, but after the long night she slept past noon. Melanie had already gotten up and was probably at the clinic helping with the work of the day. Kath would check in in a little while, see how the new arrivals were getting on.', 'The air was sticky, humid, and the sun was roasting. Calendar said it was April, but this felt like July. She was dripping sweat in moments. She wiped her face and pulled the brim of her baseball cap down to better block the glare.', 'The clinic housed thirty-two people these days. Thirty-five, she revised. Most of the clinic residents were up and about, working in garden patches, tinkering with the couple of cars they still had, cleaning and maintaining the camp. A half dozen stood at the barricade with weapons, watching. Kath waved when people waved at her, said hello. The day felt ordinary.', 'On the west side of the compound, Dr. Dennis stood outside the barricade and hit golf balls with a driver. Flung them up the road, one after the other. When it was safe enough he’d go collect them, and for some of the kids it was a game, to see how many golf balls they could recover for him. A few always stayed lost, but Dennis kept hitting them anyway. Swing, a whoosh of air, ', '. He’d shade his eyes to follow the arc of the ball until it hit the ground a hundred yards or so on. Kath didn’t know enough about golf to tell if he was any good. Didn’t seem to bother him, that he might never play a real round of golf ever again. He just seemed to enjoy hitting balls to nowhere.', 'Kath sat on the edge of the barricade and watched for a little while.', '“Morning,” Dennis said finally.', '“What happens when you run out?”', 'He shrugged. “Maybe I’ll start hitting rocks. But, maybe I won’t run out. Maybe I’ll get back to Palm Springs, when everything gets back to normal.”', 'This is normal, she thought. She was thinking that more and more, but never said it out loud.', '“You want to try it?” Dennis asked.', '“No thanks. I’m just taking a walk.”', '“Enjoy.”', '“You, too.”', 'He took another ball from the nylon bag at his feet, set it on a bare patch of ground, and lined up for the next swing.', 'Kath finished her circle around the compound and headed to the squat, concrete building in the middle.', 'The front room was crowded. The compound’s handful of resident kids swarmed. They were supposed to be settling down for the impromptu class one of the nurses taught every other day or so, but something had set them off. A giant spider, Kath gathered from the shouting. The room was loud. Anita, one of the clinic nurses, was trying to settle them down, yelling in both English and Spanish, but nothing worked.', 'Kath’s three refugees cringed away from it all, huddled at the side of the room, watching cautiously. She grabbed a couple of picture books from the basket under one of the chairs and called to Chloë. “Let’s go get some air, okay?”', 'The girl considered a moment, lips pressed in a suspicious frown. She was looking marginally better today, Kath thought. Some color in her cheeks. But then, she couldn’t look much worse than she had last night, standing in the dark, bleakly washed out by headlights. The two little ones were hunched up next to her, staring at the proceedings with round, glazed eyes. Maybe trying to decide if this was dangerous. Chloë picked up their hands and tugged them toward the door.', 'Kath found a shady spot around the side of the building where the clinic’s pots of lettuce plants lived. Wasn’t exactly a garden, but it was kind of a nice place to spend a few quiet moments.', '“Want to do the honors?” Kath asked, opening to the first page of one of the books. The little ones scooted closer, drawn by the colors and pictures of round friendly animals, putting their hands on the paper.', 'Chloë winced, drawing her limbs in to hug herself. “I can’t. I know I should… but…”', 'Kath thought that might be the case. “No worries. We’ll work on it now.” She read to them, following with her fingers, showing Chloë the words. She wasn’t going to teach the girl to read in one sitting. But they had to start somewhere. The little ones were rapt.', 'They went through the books she’d brought, went through them all again at the little ones’ insistence, and Kath asked them which were their favorites and why. They finally seemed normal. Acted normal, engaged and talking. Then they lost interest in the books and ran off to chase a grasshopper. Kath let them; they couldn’t get into too much trouble around here.', 'Chloë was still suspicious.', '“They your siblings? Brother and sister?”', '“Yeah.”', '“Where are your parents?”', 'She shrugged, shuffling through the books, brushing fingers on the covers. “What’s the point? I mean, does anybody still read?”', '“We still have books. We have a whole library inside. It’s still a good way to learn things.”', '“I guess.”', 'Kath wanted to draw her out. “Do you remember anything from before?” She was old enough; she might, unlike her siblings. Or depending on how bad things had been for her, she might have blocked it all out. “I remember a lot. I definitely don’t want to forget how to read.”', 'Chloë stared out at the barricade of junked cars. Kath didn’t think she was going to talk, and was going to let it go. Suggest they go in and find some lunch. But then the girl said, “I remember Disneyland. We went when I was really small. Got my picture with Ariel. She’s my favorite. Wish I still had the picture but it got lost somewhere. I guess it’s still there? Disneyland? What’s going to happen to it?”', 'Honestly, Kath couldn’t remember the last time she’d even thought of Disneyland. But the question suddenly filled her. What had happened to Disneyland? Another stab of grief followed. Another thing to mourn, or lock away and forget.', 'She said, “It must still be there. Some of it, at least. But the lights have probably gone out.”', '“I wish I was there. Even with the lights out.”', '“Yeah.”', 'Kath looked up; Maggie stood at the corner of the building, arms crossed. Her face was screwed up in the way it usually got when she was thinking of crying. Holding it in so hard she seemed to be in pain. Then, the look was gone.', 'Maggie said, “Hey there! Anita’s got soup cooking. Chloë, why don’t you take the others around and get yourselves fed.”', 'The girl nodded, clambering to her feet and going to fetch the others, who’d been playing some kind of tag. She didn’t call out to them, and Kath wondered about that. That she didn’t feel safe, raising her voice.', 'Kath stood and watched them go, and Maggie watched Kath.', '“You’re good with the kids. They’re comfortable with you.”', '“Yeah, I like them too.” She didn’t worry so much with the kids. She didn’t think about the future so much. Kids were easy: keep them fed, keep them clean, do everything to keep them safe. Simple. If she could teach them to read, then she’ll really have accomplished something.', 'Maggie seemed to draw even tighter to herself. Her shoulders were rigid, her hands in fists.', 'Kath’s brow furrowed. “What’s the matter?”', '“It’s just… you looked like… you don’t want to have your own kids, do you?”', 'She hadn’t thought about it at all. Food and security, that was what she thought about these days. The question startled her, and she had to think a moment, but that moment was too long for Maggie.', '“Oh God, you’re already pregnant, aren’t you? That’s why you like the kids, you’re practicing—”', '“What? No! What gave you that idea?”', 'This didn’t seem to help. “But you’re having sex. Tell me, are you having sex?”', 'Kath glared. “I’m twenty years old, of course I’m having sex!”', '“And you’re pregnant.”', '“No, God no!”', '“But have you been using protection? How do you know?” Maggie seemed desperate.', 'Kath paused, then shot back, “Because I’m sleeping with Melanie!”', 'Maggie drew back, and Kath wondered what she was going to rant about next. It wasn’t that she and Melanie had been hiding anything. It just made sense to double up on tents to save space, and they hadn’t actually announced anything when they became more than friends. It wasn’t being gay that Kath thought would upset people. It was being… adult. She wasn’t growing up. She was ', '.', 'Now, Maggie did cry. Or laugh. Something that came from tension releasing, and causing whatever was holding her together to collapse. She slumped against the wall, both hands covering her face. “I’m sorry, Kathy. I’m sorry. It’s just… we can’t feed everyone, and people keep having babies and we can’t do anything, we can’t feed them—”', 'Kath put her arms around the woman and just held her.', '“God, look at me,” Maggie said around sobs. “I’m supposed to be taking care of you and just look at me.”', '“You don’t have to take care of me,” Kath said. “You have enough to worry about, just let me… be me.”', 'They stayed like that awhile, hidden in the shelter of the building where Maggie could lose it in private, and Kath stayed to make sure she was okay. The older woman had been right at the edge for such a long time.', 'Maggie finally pulled away, scrubbing tears off her face and chuckling at herself, a strained and painful sound.', '“So, you and Melanie, huh? I think I knew that. Yeah. Oh God, I’m so messed up I can’t see what’s right in front of my face. I promised your mom I’d look out for you and if you turned up pregnant in this mess—” She took a shuddering breath, rubbed her face one more time. And like that she had put on a new mask, and was smiling. “I’m sorry. I forget sometimes, that you’re grown up.”', 'Kath offered words, a gesture of comfort, though it might hurt as much as it helped. Kath wanted to say it. “I never got to come out to Mom,” she said softly. “I mean, I sort of knew, I was starting to figure it out. Figuring out that I didn’t just put those pictures on my wall because I liked beach volleyball so much, you know? But I never told Mom.”', '“Oh, hon. You know she’d be okay with it, right?”', '“Yeah, I know. But I wish…” She shook her head. They all wished.', '“You should be in college,” Maggie murmured, running a hand over Kath’s hair.', 'All the adults said that to her in their most maudlin moments. She should be in college. Not staying up half the night with a gun under her arm. Kath herself had stopped believing anything would ever change. This was just what life was now. There’d never be somewhere else.', '“Where would you be now?” she asked Maggie.', 'She looked around at the wide-open compound that used to be part of a pleasant street, the modest building now crammed with solar panels it didn’t used to have. “I’d be here, I think. But it’d be a lot different. Can you do a watch shift tonight? Mike’s come down with something.”', '“Bad?”', '“No, just a cold.”', '“Yeah, no problem.”', '“Thanks. Just… thank you.”', '\\xa0', 'Kath’s watch shift started late afternoon and went into the evening. She covered about half the perimeter, walking on top of the barricade, stepping from car roof to truck hood to trailer and on. They’d bolted on sheets of metal and spikes, fencing, and other odds and ends to the basic framework over the years. Occasionally she’d come upon a loose bit, a piece of sheeting that moved under her feet, a car roof that was rusting out, and the next day someone would come to repair it. Used to be, they’d have four or five people covering the barricade, especially during the night watch. But since the fire and clearing the line of sight, they needed fewer people watching and could save the effort for other chores. The long approach gave the watchers plenty of time to spot trouble and raise an alarm.', 'This evening, trouble came right around dusk. The worst time, with the light fading. Her first hint came as movement on the horizon. Could have been anything, so she waited for the movement to resolve into shapes, or fade into nothing. Shadows appearing in wavering heat lines in the distance could be deceptive. She brought binoculars to her eyes, spent a moment focusing with one hand, the other clenched on the shotgun.', 'The shadows gained definition. Not a mirage, not deer or something else wandering in the distance. Now that she saw them, she heard the noise, a rumbling sound that was becoming rare. Gas-powered engines, beating against the air. Three cars, a couple of motorcycles, more than a dozen people, and those were just the ones she could see from this distance. Who knew how many were hiding inside the vehicles?', 'The convoy was racing straight for them.', 'She let the binoculars hang off their strap and cupped a hand to her mouth. “Incoming! Incoming!”', 'Someone at the clinic heard her and clanged the brass bell hanging off the front overhang.', 'They didn’t need it very often, but they had a routine for this, when strangers came barreling at the clinic compound in a way that didn’t suggest friendship. Those standing watch at the barricade stayed put, in case the invaders came on multiple fronts. A dozen others, whoever was on hand, grabbed weapons from the locker and came out to where the alarm had sounded.', 'Kath waited for her backup, shotgun in both hands, watching her targets come into range. The cars bounced and jutted over broken asphalt, while the motorcycles curved and weaved.', '“Where the hell are they getting gas from?” Dennis asked. He’d climbed up on the barricade next to Kath.', 'Maggie was right behind him. “Don’t know, don’t care. What do they want?”', 'Kath said, “Better get down, in case they come in firing.”', 'The barricade had places to shelter: inside cabs, on shielded truck beds. All the invaders would see was their shotguns and rifles bristling out.', 'The caravan stopped at the edge of firing range. If one of the rifles fired at them now, it might or might not hit. A big man, white, wearing a leather jacket and cowboy hat, scrambled out of the driver’s side of one of the cars and marched forward a few paces. He didn’t seem to be armed.', 'Kath stood tall and shouted at him across the barrel of her shotgun. “Stop! Stop and show your hands!”', 'The man’s thick beard worked, as if he was biting his lip under it. He raised his hands. “Is this the clinic?” he shouted. “The one people talk about, that has doctors and medicine? Is that you?”', '“What do you want!”', 'He gestured back. “We have wounded! We need help! We can trade for it! We have gas, guns, bullets—”', '“Food?”', 'He paused a moment. “Yes!”', 'Kath looked at Maggie and Dennis.', '“What kind of wounded?” Dennis shouted back. He stayed behind his shelter.', '“Gunshot! Two men. God, please, help them!”', 'It could be a trick. Or the man could be honest. In the end, half the people here were doctors and nurses, and they recognized that kind of desperate plea.', 'The clinic had a process for this kind of situation, too.', 'Maggie and Dennis both emerged on top of the barricade, and Maggie called out. “Okay, here’s how it’s going to work. You bring the injured men inside, the vehicles stay out. Just the injured and two people each to carry them, no one else gets in, and you leave all your weapons outside. Got it?”', '“Yes, okay, fine!”', 'And they checked, too. While the caravan pulled their injured out of the backs of the vehicles, Maggie and the clinic folk hauled open the gate, but only a couple of feet, just wide enough for two people to walk through. Two of the clinic’s biggest guys, Jim and Jorge, patted down everybody at the opening, even the injured. But they didn’t have anything, which gave these people an incremental point of trust.', 'The injured men were being carried chair style, one by two men, one by the man who’d greeted them and a woman. One of the injured seemed to be unconscious, but the other was making the guttural, deep-belly groans of someone moaning through clenched teeth. Every shadow on them looked like stains of blood.', '“Okay, get ’em inside!” Maggie, Dennis, and a trail of clinic folk escorted them to the door of the clinic.', 'Jim stayed at the barrier. “Kath, go with them, stand watch inside, we’ll keep an eye out here.”', 'An odd quiet had fallen—the vehicles in the convoy had shut off their engines, turned off their headlights; those left behind waited quietly. Evening light had all but gone, so figures moved as shapes in the dark. Shotgun in hand, extra shells jangling in the pocket of her windbreaker, she trotted after the others.', 'Unlike the quiet at the barricade, inside the clinic was loud and brightly lit. Someone was herding the kids outside, to sleep in tents. Kath spotted Chloë and spared her a smile. She and her siblings looked like they might bolt at the sign of the injured men. Kath hurriedly told her, “It’ll be fine,” and hoped that was enough. Chloë nodded, and might even have been convinced.', 'Past the waiting room, the first exam room was noisy with shouted orders. Dennis and Melanie had taken the first of the injured men here, the one grunting with fierce pain. Maggie and Anita took the unconscious man to the second exam room. Both doors stayed open and Kath was able to keep an eye on them all. Dennis was shouting orders. Melanie was talking to the first patient in Spanish, telling him to lie back, to breathe, ', '. The man started crying, ', ' Help me, help me.', 'In the second room, Maggie and the gang’s spokesman were talking.', '“We can barter,” he was explaining. “We have a whole warehouse, whatever you need. We have food. Just save them. Can you save them?”', 'The man laid out on the table had a great stain of blood covering his chest. It seemed centered on his right shoulder. A gunshot wound, not necessarily fatal. Likely he was in shock and needed support, fluid and oxygen, while the doctors cleaned the wound. But they’d need to get started on him right away. Anita and one of the nurses had cut away his shirt, inserted an IV and were peeling away cloth that had been stuffed into the wound.', 'After a deep breath, Maggie seemed to come to a decision. She explained, “We don’t need food as much as we need protection.” She looked him straight in the eye, unwavering. “We help you, you help keep us safe. You get the word out to your people, to anyone else—this is neutral ground. We stay safe, no matter what. No one attacks us, no one hurts us, no one hurts anyone while they’re here. Got it?”', '“We protect you. And you help us and no one else. Just us.”', '“No. We help everyone or it doesn’t work. We’re not a commodity. We’re here for everyone.”', '“Can’t promise that.”', 'Maggie bit her lip in a moment of thought. Then she put up her hands and stepped back from the table. After glancing at her and each other in a moment of hesitation, Anita and the other nurse stepped from the table, hands up like hers, blood on latex gloves.', 'The guy and the woman with him started forward, fists raised as if they could beat her into saving the man’s life. Kath stepped in front of him, shotgun raised, warding them off. The standoff persisted for a handful of heartbeats.', 'The lead thug grinned. “You ever even shot anyone, kid?”', '“Yes, I have.” No hesitation, no hint of bluffing. She didn’t need to bluff. Her tone convinced him; his smile fell, and he backed off.', 'Everyone watched him now, the one who would decide. His gang would listen to him. But Maggie and the other doctors were the ones who could fix things.', '“Okay. Fine. This whole place is off limits. I’ll spread the word.”', '“And you’ll make sure we stay safe.”', '“As much as anyone can stay safe.”', 'Maggie and the others closed back to the table in a flurry of action. Low-voiced commands and bits of information passed back and forth. In moments an impromptu surgery was underway.', 'Maggie said, “You all should probably wait outside.”', 'A spike of tension followed, both strangers poised to lunge forward again. As if the doctors would really do something nefarious if they weren’t supervised. Kath reasserted herself and the shotgun.', 'The clinic director made a calming gesture. “My people need room and quiet to work, it’s better if you wait.” She added, “One of you can stay to watch. Her—”', 'She nodded to the woman with the leather jacket and wary gaze looking past too much eye makeup. And where had she found a stash of useable eyeliner? “Why her?” the man asked.', '“Because she’s quiet.”', '“Cynthia?”', 'She nodded. “Yeah, okay.”', '“There are chairs in the waiting room,” Kath said, trying to sound neutral, if not friendly. Nodding, he went out.', 'Dennis had managed to kick out both of the gang members in his room. His patient was sedated now, finally quiet. The medical team was busy with gauze, alcohol, forceps, removing bullets from legs. Melanie glanced up once and gave Kath a thin smile. Kath smiled back, unsure who was comforting whom.', 'She stayed in the corridor, keeping watch over both rooms and the waiting room. There, the gang members had settled down. Too tired to argue anymore, maybe. One of them had even fallen asleep.', 'The clinic treatment rooms were made for routine outpatient care, not trauma. But Maggie, Dennis, and the others made do. By morning the two injured men were bandaged, sedated, and recovering quietly. Splashes of blood and red-stained gauze littered the floors, and a whole tray of scalpels and forceps and other instruments lay piled on a tray by the autoclave in the back supply room. The medicals were trying to clean up, wiping down surfaces, peeling off latex gloves. Wiping faces on sleeves and looking out, shell-shocked.', 'Maggie made a trip to the back supply room. When the woman, Cynthia, followed, Kath quietly moved in behind her. Just to keep an eye on her.', 'Cynthia glared a moment. “Can you close the door? Just for a minute.”', 'Kath looked at Maggie. Confused, Maggie nodded. Kath shut the door and waited, hands ready on her weapon.', 'Then Cynthia said, whispering, “Can you help me not get pregnant?”', 'Maggie froze a moment, processing. The woman pursed her lips and seemed to be holding her breath. When Maggie didn’t answer right away, Cynthia tried again. “I mean if I wanted an IUD or something, could you do that?”', '“Yes, we can do that. We’ll have to do a pregnancy test first—are you pregnant?”', 'Cynthia’s eyes widened. She looked terrified. “Oh God I hope not, I don’t want to be, that’s why I was asking—”', '“But you might be,” Maggie asked, and Cynthia ducked her face to hide spilling tears. Maggie touched her shoulder. “Come on, let’s check. Not a big deal. Kath, come in back and help me clear off that table.”', 'They went to the back exam room where they’d been stockpiling canned food. Kath had to shift boxes so Cynthia had somewhere to sit, while Maggie dug around one of the cupboards. Cynthia talked. Rambled.', '“Adam, the big guy who does all the talking… he’s taking care of me. He’s promised to take care of me.”', '“You could take care of yourself,” Maggie muttered.', '“Don’t judge me,” Cynthia said through gritted teeth. “Fucking that man is keeping me alive right now. I can’t not do it, I can’t force him to wear condoms, and I do not want to have a baby in the mess.”', 'Maggie looked away.', 'Cynthia continued. “My… my sister got pregnant. I’d managed to keep her with me all this time, I’d promised to take care of her. But seven months in she got sick. Massive headache, vomiting, cramping. Then seizures.”', '“Sounds like eclampsia,” Maggie said. “It’s a thing that happens sometimes. We might have been able to help her, but maybe not.”', '“I couldn’t save her. The baby killed her, and it isn’t supposed to be like that, I don’t want to go through that. There’d be no one to help me.”', 'The whole thing took maybe half an hour. Maggie had Cynthia go back to the bathroom to pee in a cup. The test came back negative, and Cynthia started crying again. Maggie coaxed her to undress and pulled out the stirrups on the table. “Kath, why don’t you see how they’re doing up front?”', 'Kath ducked out.', 'Both injured men were stable. Dennis was in the waiting room, talking to the gang’s leader, Adam.', '“They shouldn’t be moved for at least a couple of days. Especially not if you’re going to shove them in a car and bounce them around—”', '“Hey!”', 'Dennis put up a calming hand and tried again. “You can leave them here, no problem. And yes, any food you want to give us will be appreciated.”', '“And protection,” he said, his curled lip almost making it a sneer.', '“We’re the only medical help for a hundred miles around. Maybe more. Your people would be dead now. You tell me whether or not we deserve protecting.”', 'Adam didn’t have anything to say to that.', 'Cynthia and Maggie emerged a little while later. Cynthia looked tired, shadows under her eyes, a slump in her shoulders. But she also seemed determined. An edge of that ever-present anxiety was gone. Kath was close enough to hear Maggie say to her, almost under her breath, “We’ve got a cupboard full of IUDs. I think we even have a few diaphragms stashed away somewhere. Tell your friends. We’ll help anyone with birth control, no barter needed. Spread the word.”', 'Cynthia nodded. “Yeah. Okay.”', 'In what Kath thought was a gesture of supreme goodwill, Maggie invited Adam and his gang to stay for the day, to get some sleep, and to share breakfast. Kath realized later the underlying motive: make the clinic compound feel like home. Make it feel safe, and give them a stake in keeping it that way. They declined, however. Adam muttered something about not wanting to feel even more indebted. Cynthia took hold of his arm, whispered something, and the man settled.', 'They agreed to leave their injured and return for them in two days. That gave the clinic a couple more days to get them as strong as possible, and make sure infection didn’t set in. They had a pretty good track record with this sort of thing so far, but it would only take one death from sepsis to undo everything.', 'The stakes seemed so high, for everything they did.', '“We’re running out,” Dennis said, as they stood on the barricade, watching the caravan drive away, tires kicking up chips of broken asphalt.', '“Of what?” Maggie said tiredly.', '“Everything, really. But specifically—I think we should try to start growing some penicillin.”', 'She stared. “Can we do that?”', '“I think we can. I think we have to.”', 'Maggie bowed her head. “What you’re saying is you don’t think this is ever going to end. It’s never going to go back to the way it was.”', '“No,” he said, folding her into his arms when she started to cry.', 'Technically, Kath’s watch shift ended hours ago. A second night on her feet, she ought to be exhausted. But her nerves were wired, her skin itched. She set off for a circuit around the barricade. Still had the shotgun slung over her shoulder, shells hanging in her pocket.', 'She hadn’t gotten a quarter of the way around when she spotted Melanie standing at the barricade, looking out at the sun-baked plain.', '“You okay?” Kath asked cautiously.', '“Would it sound weird if I said that was kind of fun? Good trauma practice, you know? Nice, thinking I actually helped save someone.”', 'Kath stepped forward, well into her space, and kissed her. Jangling nerves stilled. Melanie pulled back, surprised, glancing around to see if anyone was watching.', '“We’re not being discreet anymore?”', 'Kath shook her head. “I told Maggie. She was freaked out that I was going to get knocked up.”', 'She laughed, hugging Kath close. “That woman needs to chill the hell out.”', '“Yeah. But I don’t know. She’s the one holding all this together.”', 'They walked on for a while, arms around each other. The sun felt warm this morning instead of scorching. Kath finally felt ready to lie down for a nap.', 'Looking ahead, along the junkyard edge of the barricade, Melanie asked, “Where would you be now? If none of this had happened?”', 'She wouldn’t be in Melanie’s arms, for one. That was a weird thought, that if none of this had happened she wouldn’t have Melanie. And that would be a shame. She rested her head on her shoulder and sighed.', '“It doesn’t matter. This is where I am.”', 'Copyright © 2018 by Carrie Vaughn', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Jon Foster']}\n"

From the darkly brilliant imagination of Victor Milán, the novelette “Evernight” takes readers down to the depths of the Parisian catacombs.', 'Candace Sessou is known to be many things: the ace known as The Darkness, a\\xa0 skilled negotiator in the field of diplomacy, a refugee with neither home nor family after fleeing a war-torn Congo. When she hears that her brother Marcel also survived but is now on the run as a wanted terrorist, Candace tracks him to the Parisian underground… only to strike a deal with dangerous forces in order to save both their lives.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Candace walked between walls of stacked bones and skulls, and was afraid.', 'It wasn’t the darkness that scared her. Though it was the total darkness of a place light never touches, her eyes saw clearly, if in tones of gray. She could see even through her own Darkness, as nothing else on Earth could unless she temporarily shared the gift. Darkness was, if not her friend, her intimate and tool.', 'It wasn’t the bones that scared her, either. She put out a hand and let her fingertips trail along knobbled walls of crania and condyles, and felt nothing: they were stones to her. She knew death too well. Through her actions, if not directly by her hand, she’d left a few rooms’ worth of bones to bleach beneath the African sun, herself.', 'For five years Candace had known her brother was dead. Then last night, in a dive bar in Atlanta where she was doing a job for the Miami Mob, she’d seen his grown-up face on CNN, wanted for a terrorist attack in Paris.', 'Getting an entrance visa and a ticket on such a crash basis had blown much of the roll she’d been saving to buy her way out of that employment, which she’d entered unwittingly. But she wasn’t thinking of that now.', 'She feared for Marcel. She feared the unknown she was walking into. She feared what the children of perpetual night might be doing to Marcel—and what he might do to them. Because she knew from her own experience the rage that bubbled within him.', 'It was that fear that drew her irresistibly on, through the domain of the dead.', 'Chill water sloshed around the ankles of her hiking boots. She stayed out of it as much as she could. She told herself it was leakage from the city above, not seepage from the sewers that laced Paris’s underside even more completely than the ancient limestone mines and the ossuaries which took up a small part of them did. But the smell suggested that wasn’t the whole truth, sadly.', 'She also smelled death. It had been since the Catacombs’ mute, dismembered occupants had come here for even that persistent stink to linger. But Candace knew her death-smells, of every stage of decay. Death ', ' here. Recent death. Probably of a rat or cat. But death, all the same.', 'She smelled mildew and mold and rat turds. She smelled stale human grease and dirt, and the rot that afflicts people who are still alive, if often in such an existence as not to merit the term ', '. And all of it—the smells, the closeness of the walls, the unfamiliar sensation of uncountable tonnes of soil and cement and stone hanging almost on top of her—conspired to give Candace Sessou, The Darkness, internationally wanted terrorist ace, a raging case of the creeps.', 'The Catacombs of Paris was a tourist destination long-popular because of the macabre overload induced by the spectacle of hundreds upon hundreds of meters of walls made from the dried skulls and bones of literally millions of the dead. The walls had a special name: ', '.', 'But this wasn’t the underworld’s tame tourist district. Candace wasn’t here to sightsee. And she was well aware that she was entering a domain claimed by a being of a power so fierce and expansive that it terrified not just the civil authorities, but the Corsican Mafia—and their rivals, the atrocity-loving, erstwhile secret-police and terrorist Leopard Men.', '“Okay, this is actually kind of cool,” she said out loud in English, which she’d gotten used to speaking every day, as she hugged a façade of faces void of eyes and flesh, trying to skip over a wide spot in the stream and succeeding somewhat.', 'Something stung her left ankle, above her hiking boots and thermal socks, inside the leg of her pants.', 'She jumped and failed to entirely stifle a most un-terrorist-ace-like squeak of startled terror.

Followed at once by, ', ' that ', ' She looked around uneasily. She saw nothing but bone walls and the water flowing along the limestone floor. She was actually tempted, briefly, to whip out her burner iPhone and use its flashlight app to look to see if her darkness-piercing vision was missing any nasty bugs.', ' She squelched an urge to hop away. ', 'But the stress was real. She had no idea why her brother had defied the Leopard Men’s current policy of avoiding overt terrorism in favor of pursuing lucrative, conventional crime. If he’d even been behind the midnight bombing of an empty bus kiosk, which seemed pretty pointless any way she looked at it.', 'Marcel’s likely mental state worried her too. As a child he’d always been afraid of the dark, with a touch of claustrophobia. She’d never been—until now. This place was enough to get to even an ace-powered nyctophile.', 'And who was hunting him, to make him desperate enough to seek refuge in a realm called Evernight?

No pressure.', 'Navigating by touch, keeping her eyes on what she hoped was the naturally rippling stream, she made her way toward the Queen of the Underworld’s likely seat of power.', 'She had lost six hours already to the need to sleep. She’d also eaten up precious time to use her phone for some research, followed by some tentative connection. Two groups defiantly explored the Parisian underworld’s hundreds of kilometers of Catacombs, mines, and sewers forbidden to the public. The Urban Experiment—', '—considered themselves cultural vigilantes, restoring lost and neglected areas of the great city above ground as well as below. As paranoid as the UX abbreviation they went by was precious, they’d refused all communication. The Cataphiles, though, were cheerful urban explorers, ever eager to share their illicit experiences with outsiders. Some were more than a little publicity-hungry. As lamentable as Candace found that as OpSec—if the cops ', ' wanted to shut them down, it’d take an afternoon—it served her well.', 'They’d responded readily, first to her also-disposable Gmail account, then by texts.

She preferred to use the English word ', ' for her domain as well as herself, they said.', 'Candace’s day job—the one she was trying to get out of, and had now stuck herself back deeper in—mostly involved negotiation. Deals were made.', 'Luckily, Mama Evernight wasn’t eager to kill or disappear anybody. She had ways of warning trespassers—and not just when they were actively in her domain. Many of her “children,” as they called themselves, spent some or even most of their time aboveground, engaged in panhandling and petty thievery—as well as in spying and serving as emissaries for their secret queen. But if you pushed her—you went down into the Dark, and were seen no more.', '“I just hope Mama doesn’t think I’m defying her,” Candace said out loud. Though she’d long thought herself a loner, she was starting to feel too much alone, here, with only dead-people parts for company.', 'Something stung her again, this time in her right ankle.', 'She let out an involuntary yip of surprise and fear. Looking down, she saw to her horror that something sinuous and thin had snaked out of the ripple of leakage-water and up inside the leg of her slacks.', 'Wishing desperately for a knife, she tried to tug free. More tendrils came dripping from the water. She felt them slither up her leg, around it, their touch slimy on bare skin that tried futilely to shrink away, gripping with remarkable strength. The stinging sensation hit again, stronger than before, a fire in her nerves.', 'The words formed in her head as mysteriously as the stray thought had before. This time there was no question it wasn’t hers. ', ' “I’ve come to see my brother,” she said. Her voice was steady, or mostly so.', 'She knew the voice in her head was right: she was ', ', here and now, and no mistake. And while she was a long ways from trusting its intention—', 'The stinging stopped. The horrid grip relaxed. The tendrils, now a skein, thrilled their way back down her bare leg, across her socks and boots to vanish beneath the water.', 'Ahead of her a yellow glow shone around a curve in the walls of bones. Three figures appeared, at least approximately human. Each held a torch overhead. One held two, and still had a hand free.', '“Come with us,” said the three-armed, meter-and-a-half high being covered in living, writhing slugs in a mellow baritone voice. “Mama Evernight wants to see you.”', '\\xa0', 'What first drew Candace’s eyes, in the high, echoing dome-shaped chamber of skulls, deep within the twist of the secret Catacombs where outsiders never came, were the three figures who sat on plain wooden stools by the far wall, staring at her with wide eyes. Their silent, motionless regard and the skeins they held put her in mind of the Fates from Greek mythology she learned at primary school.', 'The middle Fate, a gaunt waif of a woman with lank dark-blonde hair, silhouetted by what seemed quite ordinary utility lights on stands by the hollow-eyed walls, spoke to her. “Mama Evernight bids you welcome to her domain.”', '“Thanks,” Candace said, right before it hit her.', ' she thought. ', ' them. Formed of intertwined threads of black and purple and blue and the deep red of blood, they connected each of the three unmoving figures to what Candace had thought was a mere mound of bones jutting from the middle of the wall, at the farthest point from the entrance through which her joker guides M. Sluggo, the Archive, and dog-faced Toby had previously led her.', '\\xa0', '“You may call me the Archive,” the minute, wizened, evidently ancient man said, as they marched between ossements by dancing flame-light. Candace suspected that, while the other three likely needed the illumination, the paraffin-smelling torches they carried were meant to make an impression on her. They did.', 'Of her three guides into the underworld, he was the most normal-looking, aside from the fact he stood a good head shorter than Candace, which made him small indeed.', '“Not the Archivist?” she asked.', 'He tapped the short white hair that covered his head. “No. I keep our history here. I am older even than Mama herself. Though I was among the first, who followed her here, when we escaped the sweeps.”', '“The sweeps?”', '“When the wild card hit, France was still badly broken, recovering from the War. It was a time of profound paranoia, in which French men and women were still brutally purging one another for collaborating with the Nazis—whether they had done so or not. And above all, the survivors feared plague. Paris had been spared the worst of the war’s ravages, but elsewhere in Europe, the First Horseman of the Apocalypse rode his white horse, and reaped lives.”', '“I think I see where this is going,” Candace said, with a tightening in her gut. Along with the one that came from the surroundings—and the knowledge that, while the floor here was dry, the faint striations visible twining among the bones were some kind of presence that not only lived, but somehow ', '.', '“Yes. Parisians reacted to the wild card outbreak in unreasoning horror. Especially when most of those infected died horribly.

A place where the normal and fearful were unlikely to follow.”', '“Here,” said Candace. It seemed the response he wanted by his pause, though it made her feel like Captain Obvious.', '“Here,” the Archive agreed. “Down here with the dead, we made first a camp, and then our home. For the dying we provided what comfort we could, from medical supplies we stole from the upper world, as we did our food and other necessities. Or were given to us by sympathetic souls above.”', '“And the others?” Candace asked, though she knew the answer. “The ones taken to the camps.”', '“A few escaped,” the Archive said. “The rest were never seen again. Not the jokers nor even the aces. We—Mama’s children who are able to bear to walk beneath the light—searched for survivors for decades after. We found none.”', '“We didn’t learn this at school.”', '“No. It was suppressed—officially forgotten.”', '“But France is a haven for wild cards! No place more than Paris. I mean—isn’t it? I saw jokers living freely on the surface.” ', 'He shrugged. “When the fear and frightened anger passed, came shame. Also the American persecution of the Four Aces influenced opinion. You know us French, since you come from the Congo: we love to use the Americans as counterexamples.”', '“Yes.” She didn’t bother asking how he knew she was Congolese. ', '“Soon after she led us down here,” the Archive said, “Mama Evernight, who had drawn the Black Queen, lay down and died. So we built her a bier of bones and mournfully left her, with a grand chamber all to herself.”', '\\xa0', '“I am Cécile Shongo,” Candace said to the woman who had spoken, using the pseudonym under which she’d entered the UN refugee-protection program, after she fled the Nshombos’ fall.', 'The speaker’s pallid skin was covered with weeping sores.

But she had no idea what kind of terrible creeping cruds lived down here that ', '.', '“I’ve come to help my brother. May I see Mama Evernight?”', '“You do,” said another woman, middle-aged, normal-looking but for the eyes she now turned on Candace, black without sign of whites. “She lies—”', '“—before you,” said the third Fate, a stout man whose apparently nude body looked like a mass of calluses jumbled together. He nodded his lumpy head at the projecting skull-mound.', 'It wasn’t a random heap, Candace realized. It was a catafalque of long-dried bones. On it lay the body of a woman, which appeared to have melted partially into the loaf-shaped structure, then…hardened again, like candle wax. The skeins from the three seated speakers ran to that body, which was manifestly incapable of motion. What looked like hair surrounding the flattened features was more tendrils. Candace now saw in the shadows—for while darkness was no barrier to her vision, the transition from light made it rather more difficult for her eyes to process what lay in shade than when she was a nat—that strands ran from the corpse’s sides and limbs to vine down among the bones that held her up, and vanish into holes at the base of the curved bone wall.', 'She looked back at the blonde, sore-covered woman, then in confusion from her to her companions. “You mean—”', 'They nodded and spoke in a unison somehow more eerie than one completing another’s sentences: “That is our mother, the Queen of the Underworld.”', '\\xa0', '“But she wasn’t dead,” said M. Sluggo, his lips’…appendages…writhing to a bubble of what Candace guessed was laughter. “But none of the old beards suspected she had risen, or awakened, or whatever it was, until something stung ', '’s ankle here, and a voice spoke in his mind.”', '“Li’l Benny?” Candace said. ', ' seemed a shockingly disrespectful name for the diminutive Archive. Especially from a joker altered as extremely as Sluggo.', '“My nickname before I completed my own transition,” said the Archive equably. “You know why one might be saddled with such, no?”', '“You were exceedingly large?”', '“I was enormous. Over two hundred and eight centimeters tall, and strong as a corpse-wagon horse.” He chuckled ruefully. “With possibly some yet to grow. They say that the wild card has a mischievous streak, that grants those whom it touches what they most desire. Though I hate to think so many people long to die in horrible fashion. So say, rather, it’s influenced by what dominates one’s subconscious at the time of changing.', '“I was bookish, uninterested in sports and less in the lifetime of manual labor my father planned I should follow him in. I became obsessed with the thought that my size was a cross, and wished profoundly to be smaller. I was lucky, I suppose, in the joker I drew. Though I never envisioned becoming as you see me.”', 'Candace thought,', '“Apparently the wild card agrees with you,” Candace said. “You seem to have aged quite well.” He must be at least in his eighties now, in February of 2014.', '“In a way,” he said. “But that’s one of the gifts Mama Evernight grants to those who agree to help her in special ways.”', 'She didn’t really want to explore that subject much further at the moment. “So she can do more than just sting?”', '“Oh, so very much more,” said M. Sluggo. Slugs writhed all over him in merriment. He seemed a cheerful sort. Toby nodded his black and white head and let his big pink tongue loll extra-far over his pink gums and black underlip. “She can make you feel ', '. She spoke in your mind as she did Benoît’s that first day back, didn’t she?”', 'That alarmed Candace more. “Did she read my thoughts?”', '“No,” the Archive said. “She cannot do that. But she can read the chemicals in your blood, and the electrical impulses which sing along your nerves—sense your mood, your feelings. And she can manipulate them in order to communicate her thoughts directly into your mind. Although she finds that strenuous, and prefers to talk through her Speakers.”', '“But she seemed to respond to what I was thinking.”', '“Out loud, right?” Sluggo asked.', '“I guess. How did she know what I said?”', '“Her fibrils can do a lot more than sting or sample your biochemistry. They hear, and smell, and taste, as well as touch. Though they cannot see; Mama is blind, which scarcely inconveniences her.”', '“', '”', 'Candace thought about the whiff of sewage in the water by her boots after she left the tourist parts of the Catacombs, and her stomach turned over. ', 'The three laughed, in their various ways. “Our Mother cannot afford to be squeamish, you see,” the Archive said. “Her body needs sustenance, and lots of it. In time, everything that dies below Paris, she consumes. And a great many things come here to die.”', '“And her—fibrils—extend into the sewer system?”', '“A rich source of nutrients,” the Archive agreed.', '“How far ', ' they go?”', '“Throughout much of the ancient subterranean network that underlies Paris,” the Archive said. “Somewhere upwards of a hundred and sixty kilometers of tunnels, currently. The rest she either is still gradually infiltrating, or does not care to, for her own reasons.”', 'They passed an opening to a large side-passage, or possibly chamber, dimly lit by electric lights hung from the limestone ceiling. Parts of it were obscured by sheets of plastic hung from lines, or other makeshift sight barriers. In the area she glimpsed, Candace saw living people among the bones.', 'They were working, or talking, or just hanging out. Some faces were additionally illuminated by screen-glow from laptop computers or smartphones. Another sawed with a hacksaw at a piece of metal on a stout bench. Some sewed, some did things she couldn’t make out. Most chatted; many laughed. Children played.', 'Some were obviously jokers, some were not. At least one was an ace of sorts: a little girl of maybe ten squatting in a red dress with daisies printed on it, her face all solemn with concentration as she entertained half a dozen younger kids by passing a lively orange flame across her palm and over her knuckles, like a magician walking a coin over her hand.', 'What shocked Candace was how ', ' they looked, after all the dark glamour people on the surface had built around Evernight. They were clearly poor people. But they were nothing more or less. Just people, leading their lives as best they could.', '“Huh,” she said. The Archive glanced up, saw the direction of her eyes, and smiled.', '“Yes,” he said. “This is the real underworld. This is what Mama Evernight devoted her life—and whatever’s come after—to building and maintaining for us.”', '“Not very Infernal, is it?” M. Sluggo asked.', '“I’m reserving judgment on that one,” Candace said.', '\\xa0', '“What’s going on,” Candace asked what she had mentally dubbed the Three Fates in confusion.', '“We speak—”', '“—For Mama Evernight.”', '“She connects to us with her fibrils—”', 'Candace forced her reeling mind to quit focusing on the fact that the words came out of the mouths of three presumably different people in sequence, yet as smoothly as if spoken by a single person, and concentrate on what Mama Evernight was saying through them.', '“—and stimulates the words inside our minds, in a way familiar to you by now. We also supply whatever trace nutrients are currently needed to keep her and her fibrils aware and functioning. In return she stimulates in us a profound sense of well-being.”', ' Candace thought. ', '“I’m no physiologist,” she said, understating mightily as curiosity got the better of judgment, again, “but it seems like she—you’d—need a lot of processing capacity to handle all the information your, uh, neural network provides you. And even in your current condition”—', '—“don’t you need more than just, uh, food to function?”', '“Mama’s cerebrum has absorbed and supplanted most of the bier beneath her,” said the Archive. Though her three escorts had extinguished their torches when they entered electrically lit tunnels long before they reached Mama’s resting-place, they’d all accompanied her here.', '“I have other assistants,” Mama’s serial voice said, “who share their bodily-organ functions with me. They lie in separate chambers; I call them my Sharers. Those who converse for me I call, unoriginally enough, my Speakers.”', 'Madly, Candace wondered what Mama called those who handled excretory duties. ', ' she thought. ', 'But she felt compelled to gesture at the walls and say, “Are they—?”', '“Compensated, among other ways with a deeper sense of bliss than my Speakers are. After all, the Sharers not only do not need to move, they do not need to. And yes, most of them are voluntary.”', ' Candace thought. “I’m told my brother is here,” she said. “I need to see him, please. I—I haven’t seen him in years. I thought he was dead.”', '“The fugitive from the Leopard Men,” Mama said.', 'Candace nodded.', '“He is here, and safe. He brings danger with him. But I shelter him.”', '“Why?”', 'The three Fates shrugged as one, which Candace had to step hard on herself to keep from dissolving into hysterical laughter at. Not because she was afraid of offending Mama Evernight. Because she was afraid she wouldn’t stop.', '“In a way, he belongs. He is one of my children: he’s broken. Too broken to function on the surface. Evernight isn’t just for jokers, you know. You, an ace, are broken, too, or you would not be here.”', 'Seeing Candace’s expression through her Speakers’ eyes, Mama said, “How could I not know? I tasted your blood, child. How well I know the bittersweet tang of the alien virus.”', '“What about the Cataphiles? Are they all broken, too?”', '“Not in the profound way you and my other children are. They are but hobbyists, and never penetrate to this side of the secret entrance they showed you from the Gate of Hell area. Not if they do not wish to receive a brisk warning—at best.”', 'Candace moistened her lips. Despite the humidity down here, they had grown rather quickly dry. “May I see him?”', '“Yes.”', 'Candace felt her whole body slump as tension gushed out of her. She actually swayed, once, as she stood. “Thank God. And thank you, Mama.”', '“Wait and see. Now, as for your ace: you need not divulge your powers at this time, since you clearly do not wish to do so. I try to allow my children the greatest possible freedom. However, though you have comported yourself well so far, I must urge you to continue to act in strict accordance with the laws of hospitality. Specifically, the duties of a good guest, which you are in our house—my house.”', ' She held her head higher and stared Mama Evernight in the hollowed, ossified eyelids where her eyes used to be. “So long as I don’t feel threatened, I’ll behave.”', '“Oh, I do not threaten. Rather, I warn. Briskly, as I warned you. If the situation merits it, I shall issue a second, sterner warning.”', 'Candace was already repenting her brief episode of oppositional defiant disorder. But not enough to let go of it completely. “And then?”', 'The Fates smiled. “If you keep misbehaving,” they said as one, “Mama ', '.”', '\\xa0', 'When her burly joker escort opened the door with a pangolin-scaled arm, Candace’s heart jumped into her throat.', 'He looked at her and his brown eyes got wide. But he said in low voice, “Call me Hébert.”', 'He spoke Lingala, a major lingua franca in both Brazzaville and its twin Kinshasa, as well as in much of the Congo River basin. They had grown up speaking it as a second language, after French. Emotion almost choked off her reply. “Cécile.”', 'Then tears flooded her vision, and they hurled themselves into one another’s arms so hard they almost clashed foreheads, and for a time there was nothing but hugging and sobbing incoherent endearments, the simple joy and grief of two lost children who had found each other again.', 'Almost nothing.

A ', ' door.', 'Finally they broke apart in unison—in Candace’s case, at least, largely for air. With deep inhalations came a return of control. And attentiveness.

', '“Sis,” Marcel said in French, with the tears still streaming down his dark face. “You’ve got to get me out of here.” He spoke French now. His earlier use of Lingala meant he thought Mama didn’t know that language—and was probably listening.', '“First,” she said, forcing her mind and soul to steady, “you need to tell me how you came here. How the Hell did you wind up with the Leopard Men?”', '“The same as you did,” he said, with an alkaline rasp. Lingala again. “They kidnapped me. It was when they rounded up Mama and Papa for liquidation for asking too many questions about what happened to you.”', 'Candace clamped her mouth down on the puke that tried to gush up from her knotting belly. Knowing intellectually what had happened to her parents was one thing. Having it confirmed…', '“It was your success in their child-ace force-growing program, you see. They wanted to see if you and I shared a predisposition to draw an ace from the wild card.”', 'That rocked her back in horror. “They dosed you with the virus?”', 'He shook his head. “I didn’t pass their preliminary tests. They were only looking for candidates who might become not just aces, but a highly specialized kind.”', '“Were-leopard.”', 'He nodded and continued in French. “They kept me on anyway.

But they discovered I liked to learn and do book things, and that turned out to be more useful to them than shining their shoes and cleaning their weapons. By the time I turned thirteen, I was accountant for Léon. He’s chief of the Leopard Men cadre here. He’s a true Leopard.”', '“A shape-shifter?” Candace sucked in a sharp breath. Supposedly the were-leopard ace was Alicia’s own: the power to grant the gift of shape-shifting to a few, fanatically loyal, especially gifted followers. And supposedly it died with her.

Apparently even being a clerk for the Leopard Men’s shiny new criminal operation was strenuous.

That’s the kind of no-question terrorist attack my contacts tell me the Leopard Men have been staying away from since they got here. Also, it was lame.”', 'His smile got wider. “It stirred up the French, though, didn’t it?”', '“The Western powers are all paranoid about terrorism. The idea someone might do to them what they’ve spent centuries doing to us terrifies them. Which I guess makes sense. But all the more reason to ask why they had you do such a thing, when the Leopards’ve worked so hard to make themselves look like nothing more than a criminal gang elbowing for power in the big city.”', '“They wanted to test my resolve. Also send a message to the Corsicans, the Maghrebi out in the ', ', and the Traveler mob what could happen to them if they kept trying push the Leopard Men off the top of the heap.”', ' Candace thought.

', ' she thought, ', '“And on behalf of such a one, you agreed to serve as emissary for the Queen of the Underworld to the Special Aide?”', '“We were close.”', 'He curled his lip in disgust. “So what exactly is your business here?”', '“Confidential. You’ll need to ask the Mayor’s Special Aide that question. I bet she has the proper forms available online.”', 'He glared at her. His eyes were very dark. She expected him to strike her then. Instead he gestured to his Goon Squad. “Her leg,” he commanded curtly. “The left one.”', 'She was seized from behind and professionally pinned to the chair. Another goon knelt to clamp an iron grip on her right leg. Two more straightened out the left and pulled the dark-gray wool leg of her business-suit pants up to bare her calf.', '“So,” DuQuesne said, eyeing her as he might the fruit at a stall in the open-air market in the Goutte d’Or, “you still display the leanness characteristic of the true African, little cunt. The softness of the North American black has not infected you.”', '“I try to keep in shape,” she said. ', 'she thought, ', 'He bent down, bringing his pale, scarred face near her bare skin. A thrill of horror ran through her. ', ' kiss ', 'Instead he opened his jaws wide. Two long, curved fangs swept down and forward from the roof of his mouth, and locked into place in the gaps where his canines would be. Before she could react, he bit down hard, right into her calf muscle.', 'It was as if her lower leg had been electrocuted and firebombed at the same time. She convulsed and shrieked so loud it tore her throat.', 'He stood up, looked her in eyes now brimming with tears. His fangs clicked back into place as he closed his near-lipless mouth on a look of obscene satisfaction.', '“They call me ', ',” he said. She knew now why he talked funny. “For, like a viper’s, my bite carries venom. Do you feel it burning in your veins?”', '“Yes!” She managed not to shriek it.', 'Agony was not a new sensation for Candace Sessou. The child-ace factory had used “therapeutic” torture to stress its subjects, to encourage the retrovirus to express in them as an ace. But not pain like ', '. It felt like lava blooming beneath her skin.', '“My ace,” he said, “allows me to inject a blend of such a strength and composition as I choose, within certain limits. In your case: a mild dose of proteases with a neurotoxin kicker. I could inject enough nerve-killer to stop your heart—or enough protease venom to explode the blood cells throughout your body in a rolling tide of unendurable agony. You think you screamed just now? It’s nothing.”', '“Why are you doing this? I told you all I know!” ', ' she thought.', 'She knew she could Dark them—or she could, provided the pain died back enough to let her concentrate her will. But that wouldn’t get her out of here. They didn’t need to see to hang onto her. Or for this sadistic madman to bite her again.', '“Have you? Really?”', '“', '”', 'He nodded. “So be it. You must be telling the truth. Such a slip of a girl could never hold out against even so minor a pain. Let her go.”', ' go', ' She couldn’t believe she’d heard him right. But the GIGN men released her legs and arms and stepped back. She slumped forward in her chair. She stopped herself from grabbing her poisoned leg. She wasn’t sure if that would increase the damage the venom did. Or cause it to spread.', 'It did burn less now. A little. ', '“Are you still here? Up. You’re free. Get your black ass out of my sight before I nip you there to encourage you to move it.”', '“Why did you ', ' that to me?”', '“There will be no lasting damage, I assure you. Well, very little. You should be able to walk now. As for why—well, yes, to assure myself that your story was true, far-fetched as it seems. Also I wanted to make sure you weren’t hiding any ace powers—such people are dangerous. Of course, if you had any such, you’d have used them in an attempt to escape the agony. Futile, of course. But you couldn’t have known that.”', ' she thought.', '“Also, to impress you—and your monstrous mistress below the ground. Her powers and mine are not so very different, you see. We both possess a potent sting; we have likewise senses the average human does not. We share the gift of manipulating human biochemistry. Even if I lack her power of using neurochemical interfacing to control the human mind.”', '“And finally—” he smiled and let the fangs snap down again briefly—“for the fun of it. This is a stressful job I have, keeping Western civilization safe from savage animals. You can’t begrudge me a little sport, can you?”', '\\xa0', '“This program is far advanced, I regret to say,” the Mayor’s Special Aide for Wild Card Affairs said. “Much against our wishes, as I trust you understand. Our mission is to help people, not—anyway. Tell me what Mama Evernight has to offer, to induce me to do more to stop this tragedy than I have already.”', 'Maryam Boumedienne was a handsome, gracefully dignified woman of North African descent. She stood a head taller than Candace and was willowy despite clearly being well into middle age, with hips broadened from child-bearing.

Consider: A modern city needs its refuse dump.” She felt no shame at cribbing from one of the Archive’s lectures. “Plus an extensive sewer system.”', '“Much of which has been co-opted into Evernight,” Boumedienne said.', '“Well, they don’t actually live in the sewers. Or not many. In any event, consider the service Evernight provides: a catchment for those, jokers, nats, even minor aces, who find themselves unable to function in the surface world.”', '“But we offer services for those poor people,” Boumedienne said. “That’s among the duties of my department, not to put too fine a point on it.”', '“And I’m sure you do your best, Madame. But, with all respect, please consider what a wonderful job those social services must have done for these people, these Evernighters, that they’d choose to live in a place with bones for walls instead.”', 'Boumedienne winced. “Point taken. And—it’s true. We cannot provide for the particular needs of everyone. We must provide for the common welfare.”', '“Mama Evernight and her children define ‘uncommon.’”', '“True. But even leaving aside your brother’s recent terrorist act, as you request, there are people of highly dubious moral character living down there.”', '“There is also a large, thriving, tightly knit community of people peaceably living their lives. It’s not too much to call it a family. I have seen it with my own eyes. And—Mama does enforce what few rules she has laid down quite strictly.”', '“She was one of the ‘dubious characters’ I was referring to.”', '“Is it worth wiping out an entire community to get at her?”', '“The operation would not necessarily kill everybody down there. Despite the expressed desires of some.”', ' Candace thought. “How many do you think it would be necessary to kill, then? Whom would you kill?”', '“Why, none—if it could be helped. But, but—it would be a humanitarian intervention. Some collateral damage is sadly inevitable. But in the service of the greater good.”', '“Mme Boumedienne, those killed by humanitarian intervention stay just as dead, the arms and legs and faces stay blown just as far off the wounded, as in war by any other name you want to give it. I’ve seen it up close. And I tell you: anybody who thinks such a thing as ‘humanitarian warfare’ is even possible does not understand what at least one of those words mean!”', 'The Special Aide looked uncomfortably away.', '“Let me put it another way,” Candace said. “Would you shut down the sewers of Paris because they had some alligators in them?”', '“Well—they’re really Nile crocodiles. And there are not so many of them. And they ', ' keep down the rats…”', '“You begin to see my point.”', '“All right. This is all very well and good. But I need more. Give me something that I can take to the Mayor—to the national authorities—which will persuade them to stay the Gendarmerie’s hand.” A beat. “Please.”', 'Candace leaned forward across the neat desk. “Mama abhors all crimes of violence, including terrorism. You must know that, from your years of dealing with Evernight. So she makes no threats. She merely asks you to imagine the effects on the peace and well-being of your city’s straight citizens and tourists in the event of even a successful decapitation strike: the horde of angry, embittered jokers and fugitives that would fill the Métropolitain stations and pour up from every manhole and access-tunnel in Paris.”', 'The pale-brown eyes got wide. “Shit,” the Mayor’s Special Aide said.', 'Candace sat back, nodding. “Precisely.”', 'Boumedienne frowned at nothing for a few moments. Long enough for Candace to start getting itchy about her brother’s fate. And her own. ', 'she thought,', '“Very well,” the Special Aide said at last. “I think I can persuade them with that…graphic image. Even the upper ranks of the Gendarmerie National—even the commanders of GIGN themselves—realize that such a measure as they propose is extreme, and likely to produce blowback. When I share your description of the nature of such blowback, I think they’ll reconsider.”', '“So you agree to Mama’s terms?”', '“Yes. Now, let’s talk about yours.”', '“I’ve guaranteed my brother’s continued good behavior to Mama, which guarantee I likewise extend to you.” ', ' “He will honor that guarantee. He’s desperate. Desperate enough even to behave.”', '“Even so, he’s still wanted for an act of terrorism.”', '“I’ve also promised Mama Evernight to have him out of the country within twenty-four hours. That would get him out of your hair.”', '“‘Terrorist,’” Boumedienne repeated. “That’s a magic word these days. It makes rights and justice go away. Along with a good deal of sense.”', '“That’s true. But in exchange for his freedom, he’s willing to provide all the details he knows about the Leopard Man leadership cadre in Paris—which means all of France. Names, dates, plans, the works. ', ' he was Léon’s own accountant.”', '“You mean—”', '“He’ll give you their financial records, down to the PIN numbers on their pseudonymous bank accounts.”', '“That—that would excuse a very great deal.”', '“And after all,” Candace said, “it’s not as if anybody was hurt. It was only a bus kiosk.”', '“It’s not as if anybody else was ', '. The only reason we identified your brother was that several surveillance cameras captured him in the act. We were able to match his face with an individual Gendarmerie agents have photographed in the company of known Leopard Men, and near known Leopard Men locations. Still—the kiosk will cost 63,000 euros to repair.”', 'Candace whistled. “So much?”', '“You know government contracts.” Mme Boumedienne stood up and offered her hand across the desk. “All right. You have made yourself a bargain. I know the Mayor will see the wisdom of your proposals, and the President as well. As for the National Police and the Gendarmes—well, they’ll either see the light of wisdom, or do as they are told, depending. I cannot yet guarantee acceptance. But I think the chances are good.”', 'Candace almost deflated into a limp rubber sack like an empty balloon. “Thank you,” she said, pulling herself together enough to rise and clasp the proffered hand.', '“You are a brave woman, Mme Shongo,” the Special Aide said. “Your brother cannot know what a remarkable sister he’s fortunate enough to have.”', '“Probably not,” Candace said. “He’s my younger brother.”', 'Boumedienne laughed, but quickly went serious again.', '“I only hope your courage turns out not to have been rashness in the end. Good day to you. And good luck.”', '\\xa0', ' Candace asked herself, checking her smartphone again. It was 2258. Two minutes later than last time.', 'It was chilly. Her breath puffed out visibly to join the mists creeping out of the Seine to fill the Place Vendôme with the smell of diesel exhaust and grease-trap rankness. The lights glowed dim and yellow, and few people walked abroad. A pair of lovers gazed arm in arm up at the statue of the flying ace Captain Donatien Racine, known as Tricolor, atop the famous column commemorating his defense of Paris from the 2009 attack by the Radical—her old crush and mentor, Tom Weathers. A shabby man—one of Mama’s children?—marched past the gate to the Tuileries, swigging wine from a bottle and mumble-singing indistinctly to himself.', 'Her own warm buzz of success and champagne was starting to curdle in her stomach. ', 'Like everybody packed anxiously into Mama Evernight’s crypt, her brother had gone manically happy when Mme Boumedienne called to announce that the President himself had ordered the Gendarmerie to stand down from its planned attack. Candace’s bargain had been accepted.', ' She’d been in a happy place she’d almost forgotten existed, swilling Moët & Chandon from the bottle like the mumbling hobo minstrel, dancing and chanting along to “La Marseillaise” echoing off the bone walls from big speakers playing off somebody’s iPod. She had the hairy arm of the two-and-a-half-meter-tall joker called Bigfoot across her shoulders from one side, and the hard, dense arm of the Mauritanian joker-ace who called herself ', ' from the other. ', ' she remembered thinking. ', 'She had pulled together enough to suggest that she come along and watch his back. But no, Marcel said. He had to go alone. He’d stashed thumb drives containing key financial records with a Christian refugee from the Albanian civil war, a shopkeeper who’d suffered mightily from Leopard Man extortion. He’d been planning his escape for a long time, he said.', 'His contact had the paranoid hypervigilance of an alley cat. If Marcel brought anyone along, he’d shut down and hunker behind steel shutters. So Candace nodded; her brother kissed her fervently on the cheek, thanked her for the hundredth time, promised to meet her in the Place Vendôme at 2100, and left Evernight.', 'Their flight from Orly left at 0130. Darkness was beginning to muster in Candace’s stomach, and tension knotted around the black sensation. To distract herself from her thoughts, and the growling of the terrible thing that lurked in her under-brain, she glanced up the column’s bronze, already green four years after its construction. Despite the French government’s official reversal of its initial genocidal approach toward those touched by the wild card into operatic concern for their welfare—powered both by guilt and a desire to twit the Yankees for their Four Aces witch hunt—it kept tight rein on everyone who drew the ace. Every one detected they conscripted into government service. As a consequence, France had few publicly known ace heroes to adore. Because Captain Racine’s heroics had been broadcast live worldwide on video news feeds, the government opted to make him the public face of its shadowy ace corps—and a tourist attraction.', 'Candace recalled her encounter with another official French shadow-ace that afternoon, shuddered, and felt unclean. Tricolor’s bravery was real. But it was being used to hide a lie.', 'Her iPhone started playing the signature tune from Van McCoy’s “The Hustle,” a current favorite song twenty years older than she was. She almost dropped it yanking it from her purse. “Hello?”', '“It’s Sluggo,” her caller said. “Your brother’s been spotted heading for the Leopard Man HQ in the Goutte d’Or. You must come at once.”', 'She barely remembered to end the call with a stab of her thumb before turning and sprinting for the nearest Métro stairs.', ' done', 'Already, she feared she knew.', '\\xa0', 'When the stench struck her like a fist through the open front door, Candace flicked her knife blade into place. She stepped cautiously out of the feather-light sleet falling on the lower slope of the Mount of Martyrs into the normal-looking two-story gray stone house, cramped on a block of near-identical houses with steep slate roofs, to which Samuel L. Jackson’s voice on her GPS had led her from the Château Rouge Métro stop at a dead run.', 'She opened her mouth, and Darkness rolled out to precede her. Nothing could see through it but her, and those she temporarily allowed to. A were-leopard might hear and smell her well enough to strike, but a far more likely nat gunman would see nothing to shoot at.', 'Not that anyone she saw was in any shape for shooting. Two bodies, male, and what she thought was parts of a third sprawled in attitudes of violent death, their own guts, and all their blood on the sodden throw rug—an oddly domestic touch for Leopard Men—the doorway that opened to her right, and the stairs themselves. An old-school AKM, heavier, and higher-caliber than modern assault rifles, lay propped almost theatrically at the foot of the stairs.', 'She let it lie as she passed by. She didn’t need it. Also the recoil from 7.62 cartridges and steel buttplate hurt her shoulder.', 'The smell was familiar. Fear and fresh blood and shit. She hadn’t smelled it for years. ', ' At the house’s rear an oblong of relative lightness showed a back door also ajar. Another body lay on its front past the stairs, with its head turned to the side. Half its head. The rear half.', '“You have strong jaws, you treacherous bastard,” she muttered.', 'From ahead, she heard a snarling and a spitting, and she ran.', 'She crossed a short, bare yard that stank of pee and weed, just missed stepping on one of a litter of discarded wine bottles and falling, and clambered up onto a stone wall just higher than her head.', 'A narrow alley confronted her. In the next yard, two leopards fought, a larger and a smaller.', 'They squatted on spotted haunches, yowling and swiping for each other’s faces. Though both were covered in blood, the larger one’s left shoulder lay open to bone, blood running in the rain. As Candace drew herself upright, balanced on the rounded wall-top with the help of a couple years’ ballet classes in Cape Town, she saw the bigger gather itself and leap on the smaller.', 'Rather than spring to meet it, the lesser leopard rolled backward across its twitching tail onto its butt, accepting the attack with its forepaws. The larger cat’s momentum flung it all the way onto its back. The bigger landed on top, its hind claws raking at the lesser’s belly.', 'The smaller leopard’s jaws clamped on its throat.', 'A natural leopard killed larger prey by holding its throat closed in its teeth until it suffocated. But Leopard Men—the few, the proud, the weres—they loved the taste of blood. Their shared ace had given them mighty jaws and razor teeth. And what was power, if not to be used to the utmost? To be enjoyed?', 'With a heave of its round head, the smaller leopard ripped the throat clean out of the one atop it. The bigger one fell onto its side on the flagstones, kicking and gushing.', 'Candace’s heart seemed to pause its beating.', 'The smaller cat jumped up—and continued rising, to stand bipedal, hunched over as if in pain. To her relief and fury mingled she saw it was Marcel, naked. A taller, older African man, likewise naked, lay bleeding to death at his feet.', 'Her brother swayed. He was awash in blood. But Candace saw no sign of deep wounds beneath the gore.', '“Marcel!” she shrieked. He turned his blood-masked face to her. Their eyes locked.', 'He turned and staggered around the hip of the darkened house with surprising speed. Too late, it came to her to try to Dark him. ', 'She jumped down from her wall, scrambled over the next, vaulted the dying Léon, and ran after her brother. He was weakened by exertion, and mostly by the stress of transforming from a seventy-kilogram boy into a seventy-kilogram cat, with its drastically different skeleton and muscles, and back again to human.', 'She ran out past the house and stopped. Two figures stood on the street, looking at her. “M. Sluggo,” she said, panting more than she should have. “Toby.”', 'Toby uttered a greeting bark. He sounded cheerful. Then again, having a dog’s head atop an otherwise-human body, he probably always sounded cheerful, unless he was growling. “Our people have your brother, and are taking him below,” Sluggo said mournfully. Or so she took it from the flaccid dangle of his slugs. “You must come with us. You won’t make us compel you, too, will you? Please?”', 'She sighed. “No,” she said. “Lead me to the Underworld, psychopomp. Do I need to give you a Euro?”', 'Sadly Sluggo shook his head. “Alas,” he said, “I have no boat. Come on.”', '\\xa0', '“You betrayed me.”', 'On the march down and down into the everlasting dark, and round and round through corridors of bone and stone, Candace had wondered what exactly she would say when—if—she confronted her brother.', 'Now the two were locked in the same cell he’d been held in before. She was as much a captive in Evernight as Marcel was. She just wasn’t restricted to this room.', 'She knew, now, what she’d say, having said it. But she was still surprised at how levelly she spoke.', 'He sneered. His handsome, earnest-schoolboy features twisted in a look of hate so pure it rocked her on her heels. “Don’t talk to me about betrayal!” he screamed. Then more quietly: “You betrayed us, Darkness.”', '“', '”', '“You and the others—the Hunger, Mummy, Wrecker—you were heroes of the Revolution, the fighting vanguard of our glorious PPA! Yet you deserted Alicia and the People’s Paradise in their greatest need. You deserted the Revolution.”', 'She glared at him through narrow eyes. ', '“Fuck your Revolution,” she said, in a low, intense voice. “It was all a bunch of lies Alicia and her brother told us to serve their greed and power-lust. We killed more black people than the imperialists did. By far. We even murdered more of our own—people inside the PPA—than any outside enemy ever did.”', 'Marcel scoffed. “What about Captain Flint and the Highwayman and their living atom bomb that killed so many of our soldiers?”', '“Who do you think did most of the Nshombos’ murder for them? Not us; we were few, though we murdered our share, many times over. Your precious soldiers. I don’t waste tears on them. Any more than I do the British aces, scapegoated by their own to assuage their tender colonialist consciences. I’m not saying the imperialists were good. I’m saying we were worse. Sometimes I wish we’d all died in the blast, too—us child aces. It would have been better for the world. And probably us as well.”', 'But saying that, she felt a pang of loss, for the other stolen ones, her comrades in living through a Hell no one should have to endure, much less children. It lent an acid splash to her next words. “The Nshombos made us monsters, Marcel. You and me both. But they were the greater monsters by far. That’s what I turned against. And I’m glad!”', '“You only say that because you were the whore of the white devil! The one who misled us, and murdered the Doctor!”', '“Oh, come the fuck off it, Marcel. Tom Weathers wasn’t a good man, but one thing he was not was into literally fucking children. Even though he helped your precious Nshombos fuck us all!”', 'And just like that, he ', '—partway. Her own reflexes were naturally fast. But she was only able to skip back and turn her head far enough fast enough that the claws at the end of his left arm, now spotted-furred and inhumanly jointed, only gashed her right cheek, instead of tearing her whole face off her skull.', ' she thought as she opened her mouth and Darked him.', 'He screamed in leopard fury and lashed out. She backed up to the locked door and pounded on it with her palm, hoping ', ' and Brick outside would realize what was happening and let her out.', 'He turned toward her. His head was still human. The look on his face was not. Though his arm was still transformed—he probably hadn’t recovered the energy for a full change—he didn’t have a leopard’s senses. But he didn’t need them. He could hear just fine. And it wasn’t hard to make out where she was. He gathered himself to leap. Candace made ready to dodge, hoping she was faster than his mostly human body.', 'The door opened behind her. Her brother shrieked as fibrils lashed from tiny holes hidden in the stone walls and tangled his arms, his face.', '“Don’t kill him!” she screamed, as rock-hard hands yanked her backward into the corridor. “Please!”', '“I will not,” an eerie voice said from her right.', 'She turned. Between bone walls stood the Archive, small and neat, bearing the distinctive multi-colored tendril leash of one of Mama’s Speakers around his neck.', '“Not now, at least,” he said, the voice his own but echoing the cadence and timbre of a woman long dead—and eternally alive. “Now you must come and learn your fate.”', '\\xa0', '“Please don’t kill Marcel, Mama,” Candace said the moment she entered the Queen’s burial chamber. “I beg you. Take me instead.”', 'A middle-aged Vietnamese woman called Pétunia had cleaned the wounds her brother’s claws had opened on her face, closing them with a healing ace. “There might still be scarring, dear,” she’d told Candace.', 'Candace only shrugged. For a moment she’d thought the fact the Evernighters tended her wounds meant Mama didn’t mean to kill her. Then it occurred to her Mama might just not want Candace passing out from blood loss before hearing her death sentence.', '“Your life is forfeit anyway,” said Ariane, the blonde woman covered in weeping sores. Apparently the first shift of Speakers she’d encountered was back on duty. “Along with his.”', '“And yet you’d try to bargain your life for your brother’s, even after what he did to you?” That was Evadne, the middle-aged woman with the all-black eyes.', '“He’s my brother. It’s not as if my life is such a fucking carnival, anyway. Just—just keep him. I know you can’t let him go. But alive. Kill me.”', 'Aristide, the naked, callused man said, “You may redeem your life and his.

Though details of the agreement with us have been covered up as a matter of routine, it’s been leaked that the Mayor and the President agreed to give Evernight a reprieve on the grounds they prevent a wanted terrorist from striking again.

We got no time.”', 'At ten, including a couple of little kids, the chain got unwieldy. By this time most of the others had calmed down enough that she could get the young man closest to her to shut his three eyes so she could touch the lids. “You link up with the rest and follow the first group. Quickly!”', '“Who are you?” Twenty meters along the first woman, who now could see, had turned her face back over her shoulder to Candace as she staggered.', '“Life,” she said.', 'She looked the other way. The way she was bound.', ' she knew with sickness in her soul.', '“And death.”', '\\xa0', 'Screams flew to meet her as she ran. Some ended in choking. Candace’s steps didn’t fault her, though it felt as if she’d been stabbed in the belly.', 'An elderly woman staggered toward her around a curve, wheezing and staggering, keeping contact with the rough limestone tunnel wall on her right with an outstretched hand. Her labored breathing seemed to result from terror and exertion, not nerve agents, and she was moving toward what she clearly hoped was safety with all the speed her body still had.', 'A few meters behind her, leisurely strolling, came a GIGN Section 23 operator. He had his own gloved right hand to the wall and was holding a nozzle in the other. “We told you, you old bitch,” he called out. “If you run, you’ll just die tired.”', 'He sprayed her. The gas the operators carried obviously had some sort of dye in it so they could see where it went. Ironically, Candace was the only one to see it now; their night-vision goggles, whether low-light or equipped with active infrared which lit the wearer’s way with an IR flashlight, couldn’t penetrate her Dark.', 'The Evernighter woman started a shriek as she felt the loss of neuromuscular control grip her chest and begin to strangle her like a python. She fell to her knees, beating futilely against the wall and floor as she gagged and dry-heaved.', ' Candace thought. Her feelings had gone dead numb. But her mind raced ahead. ', 'She made herself hang back, despite the urgency thrilling in her nerves that made it a kind of agony ', ' to run forward.', 'The operator walked forward, still feeling his way along the wall. He didn’t spray more gas. Of course their supply was limited to what they could carry.', 'All Candace had to do was flatten herself against the opposite wall, and wait.', '“Hello, Gaspard,” she said into his ear from behind. She knew his voice, muffled or not; DuQuesne had named him when he hustled her in for interrogation. Candace had keen senses and a keener memory. “Hope you got enough jollies with that pain-compliance grip on my arm to last you a lifetime.” Candace grabbed his mask, yanked it up his face, thrust her knife into his throat, and ', '. The blade cut easily through muscle and cartilage and rubbery jugular veins. He couldn’t even gurgle a warning through his own blood on their communications net.', 'She put the mask on her head but left it up. Gaspard rolled side to side on his belly, hands struggling to slow the blood that was gushing onto the use-smoothed stone floor. She knew there was a chance, however small, he could survive the severed veins. She stabbed his neck again beneath his left ear and cut his carotid artery. His body bucked up off the floor and went limp as his brain, deprived at once of half its blood, shut down.', 'Candace wiped her blade on his ass, folded it, and slipped it in her jacket pocket. She pulled the mask down over her face, ignoring the stink of Gaspard’s breath and the garlic he’d had for his last meal, and tightened it as best she could. She was far smaller than he was, but the respirator and goggle set were clearly not custom-fit.', ' she thought, ', 'She stood straight and walked on around the bend. The old mining tunnel widened into a gallery, and she confronted a gray-scale image of agony and despair, like an animated Doré etching of ', '. The dying writhed and choked with tears and snot running from eyes and mouths, clutching each other, stretching hands that pled toward the masked men. Who could hear and feel their suffering, even though they couldn’t see it. They kicked their victims in their faces and laughed at the torments they inflicted like Dante’s demons.', 'Twenty doomed souls? Thirty? Candace couldn’t tell. She took a deep breath and released the grip of iron self-control she’d maintained for five hard years.', 'She stalked forward, as feral and merciless as her brother in his leopard form, walked up to the closest GIGN operator, and stripped the mask right off his face. Then skipped away twirling it by the strap as he dropped to his knees, clutching at his throat.', 'The next two operators sensed something amiss, put themselves back to back with the gas-nozzles raised defensively. “Bruno?” one said in an Eastern European accent.', 'Candace tossed Bruno’s mask away and pulled his off. His partner helpfully turned his head for her to strip his too. They actually dropped their sprayers to cling to each other as their mouths filled with saliva and then their lungs ceased to work, kissed by the fast-acting “next level” poison gas. “Touching,” she said, and moved on.', 'She knew the next one, too, who stood above a large woman lying dead on her back with eyes and mouth agape. He’d been the one who seized her left leg and bared it to ', '’s tongue. He’d seemed to get into fondling her bare skin a little more than professional cruelty required.', 'Candace planted herself right in front of him. “This is for groping me,” she said, and shin-kicked him in the balls. He had some kind of cup on under his trousers. It didn’t help him much. She whipped his gas mask back off his head as he doubled toward her.', 'A hand brushed her left shoulder, then clamped like trap-jaws on her biceps. “Got you, you bitch!” He had his gas-nozzle thrust almost against the weird bifurcated snout of her respirator mask and was spraying it with mad optimism—as if the nerve agent wouldn’t have killed her long since if it could. She whipped her knife out and open.', 'A single vicious slash across the back of the hand that held her laid open glove, skin, and tendon to bone. His fingers went slack. She slashed his throat, then pulled off his mask for good measure as he dropped to his knees grabbing at his gullet as if to slow the bleeding.', 'She looked around. And then there were none. ', ' she wondered. “He got past you when you were focused on the others,” she said aloud into her mask. It was as if some third party offered commentary.', 'She turned and ran back the way she’d come—toward Mama’s chamber, the heart of Evernight. No less a monster than she was now, her enemy was likewise no less focused. He was still bent on poisoning and killing Mama, and destroying Evernight.', 'The mask made breathing hard. Candace ran. Around the bend she saw ', '’s back. Still blinded by her Darkness, he forged determinedly on, left hand outstretched to touch the limestone wall. She slowed her pace to a brisk walk. No point winding herself. She still moved faster.', 'Ten meters beyond the bodies of the woman and Gaspard he stopped, turned, and stripped off his mask. “I hear you,” he said. “Which terrorist are you? Your steps don’t sound too heavy.” He stood smiling, seeming calm. But his mouth was open far enough that she could see his fangs twitching partway down from the roof of his mouth and then back, as if to nerves.', 'She took her own mask off. “I’m the little black bitch you tortured,” she said, stalking forward. She watched him closely for a move to draw the Manurhin .357 Magnum revolver holstered beneath his left arm.', '“Shongo?” He looked and sounded surprised.', '“My name is Candace Sessou. I was one of the PPA’s terrorist child aces. I’m one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. I am The Darkness. I’m going to kill you.”', '“Impressive. And you’re telling me this why?”', '“One of us at most leaves here alive,” she said softly, “so why not?”', 'Three meters from him now, she slipped to the tunnel’s far side so he couldn’t target her by sound. She meant to slip behind him and use her knife.', 'DuQuesne laughed and stuck his tongue out at her. The childish gesture made her stare harder at him. “I thought you’d be dead, having failed your infernal mistress. Well, you will be soon.” Again his tongue flicked out. It made Candace’s skin crawl. ', 'wrong ', '—', 'He lunged straight at her and punched her in the face.', 'Sparks burst behind Candace’s eyes and she sat down hard on a dry patch of floor. ', ' she thought. ', ' She rolled right, started to get up.', 'A boot in the side lifted her in the air and dumped her on her right hip. He kicked her again in the pit of the stomach. The air blasted out of her lungs.', 'He kicked her in the face. She fell onto her back, stunned.', 'His weight landed hard astride her hips. She slashed at him with her knife but her eyes wouldn’t focus and she missed. She struck him in the chest with her left fist but had no strength.', 'For a moment they banged forearms off each other. Then the ', ' caught her right wrist and pinned it to the yellow stone floor. He trapped her left a moment later.', 'He leaned toward her, opening his mouth. The fangs swung down from their slots in his hard palate with cruel deliberation. The venom-stink washed over her. “Poison’s not the only gift my ace gives me, little terrorist,” he said. “I can taste you from several meters away.” The fangs retracted enough to let him waggle his tongue at her.', 'Her wits were starting to coalesce again inside her battered skull. ', 'The irony failed to cheer her. He was leaning his face slowly closer to hers. “And now I’m going to bite you,” he said, “right in the face. Just a touch to paralyze you. Now that you’ve so conveniently come to me, I have a little time to play before I kill the Queen of the Underworld….”', 'Sheer outrage drowned initial terror at her utter helplessness, that he was playing with her now because he was by far the stronger.', 'She rolled her right wrist and cut the back of his left one with the folder’s locked-back blade. He uttered a strangled cry and reared up. Both grips on her wrists slacked slightly. ', '. She couldn’t match her muscles to his, but she was wiry strong. She eeled her hands free, gashing his left palm on the way out.', 'Inhumanly wide-spread jaws darted for her face, the long fangs fully extended. She stabbed between them, into the roof of his mouth.', 'He screamed shrilly. She writhed out from under him and jumped up. He was clutching the knife-hilt with both hands, trying to yank it free. ', 'He let go with his right hand and yanked out his heavy revolver. She was still almost muzzle-contact close. She threw herself backward, hoping his tongue couldn’t taste her with her knife in the way.', 'The noises he made had turned to furious gobbling. Now as she landed on her back and rolled, they rose in pitch and urgency. And then were muffled.', 'She rolled against the wall, expecting the smash of a bullet every instant, and looked at him through the dark. DuQuesne had what looked like a bandanna wrapped around the lower half of his face.', '—', 'She noticed his eyes were so wide she could see whites all around his irises. A dark mottling shot through with black veins crept up the visible half of his face as his choked cries rose an octave.', '“Oh,” she said, as thick bundles of fibrils lashed from the floor and walls to entangle DuQuesne’s neck and arms. “Looks like Mama can do that blood-exploding thing, too. I bet that hurts.”', 'She stood up and watched Mama Evernight’s hemolytic stings have their way with ', '. The instant he fell still and silent, she turned and started the long limp back to Mama’s burial chamber.', 'She knew what happened next, and that she didn’t want to watch.', '\\xa0', '“You have done well,” Mama said in her borrowed voice. She had three Speakers Candace hadn’t seen before and was too tired to pay much attention to. But the others were all there in the crowd in Mama’s outsized crypt, along with most of the other people she’d met before, like Toby and Sluggo and, of course, the Archive, as well as a bunch she hadn’t met. “I understand why you severed my fibrils. There was nothing else you could do, and nothing either of us could have done to save more of our people.”', '“Yeah,” said Candace.', 'The current Speaker, an elderly man, gestured toward the television set. Though its volume was low, Candace could hear the blonde news-reader woman talking about the tragic cave-in which had killed seven members of GIGN’s Section 23, inside the old mines for a nocturnal training exercise.', '“The President knows that Colonel DuQuesne made unauthorized use of nerve gas against French citizens,” the Speaker said. “Or if he authorized it, he has conveniently forgotten it, chosen to cover the whole thing up, and has had Mme Boumedienne on the phone to extend us the olive branch. We’ve won.”', '“We have purchased tickets for you on a flight leaving Orly in three and a half hours,” a young man with what looked like small fish-fins sticking out of his face and head at odd angles said. “The authorities will be more than happy to see you go. Do you need to collect any baggage?”', '“I never travel with anything I can’t walk away from.” Is ', '“Then my children will convey you there. You may leave as soon as you wish. And—thank you.”', '“Yeah.” Candace shook her head. She felt tears start. Fears of loss and anger and a thousand more things than she could name. “They won’t stop, you know. They won’t leave you alone. Whether it’s run by compassionate imperialists, or the brutish kind, the system’s still ', '. It can’t put up with competition or defiance. And it will not stop until it overwhelms you, one way or another.”', '“We will survive,” Mama answered with serene conviction. “Whether it means digging deeper, or something else—we will survive. It’s what we do.”', '“Me too,” Candace said. “Now, about my brother—”', 'In a moment she heard him shouting behind her. “Candace, please, you have to help me! ', '”', 'Brick and Bigfoot had dragged Marcel in. He had on another set of castoff clothes. He also had a fibril skein around his neck, ready to sting him if he tried to shape-shift.', '“I did help you, Marcel. And you were helping ', ' all along. How did he turn you? Was it the torture? That was bad, I know. He bit me too. So I killed him.”', ' she thought foggily.

They thought he would control me. But young people are hearing the message of the True PPA. The old ones had gotten soft, even Léon. He had no idea what I would build once I controlled the Leopard organization!”', '“So you were playing him the way you played me?”', '“It was for the Revolution,” he said, as pious as Mass.', '“No,” she said. “You ', ' you were. In fact—”', 'In her reduced state she reeled physically from revelation’s impact. Toby steadied her arm with a black and white dappled hand.', '“—DuQuesne was playing you to take down the Leopard Men. The way he played me, to force the President’s hand to stop equivocating and let him kill Mama and wipe out Evernight without any more debate or delay.”', '“No! He couldn’t have been!”', '“Because he was so trustworthy?”', 'His eyes went wide, and his mouth shut.', '“As you see,” Mama said gently through a Speaker, “we can never let him go.”', 'Candace sighed. “Yes. I do see that. You changed, Marcel. And not for the better.”', 'She looked at Mama’s form, embossed atop her bier of bones. “But remember your promise. You can’t kill him, either!”', '“I keep my bargains. You won his life as well as your own. But your brother must stay here forever in Evernight. He will Share his organ functions with me, and do his part to sustain me. And through me my people, to whom his foolish actions have brought so much harm.”', '“See, Candace? See? They’re going to tear me apart, and rape my body for my organs!”', '“That’s not how it works, young man,” the Archive said. “Mama Evernight will connect her body to yours as she does to ours when she needs to: with her fibrils. You will not suffer. She will stimulate your brain chemistry so that you lie in perfect endorphin bliss. It’s like sleep, but better; I know.”', '“I wish that horrified me as much as it should,” Candace said.', '“No, no!” Marcel shrieked, struggling wildly and uselessly. “They’re going to drug me!

      "{'Title': ['You Know How the Story Goes'], 'Author': ['Thomas Olde Heuvelt'], 'Body': ['It’s the same old story. Take a chance and pick up a hitchhiker. But only after midnight and only when you need some company. Of course, the hitchhiker will disappear. That’s the way the story goes, right? But this time you are the hitchhiker. And there’s a tunnel up ahead.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'You know how the story goes. One night, you pick up a hitchhiker on a country road. A young lady. It’s always a lady. This lady, she’s paler than the moonlight and doesn’t talk a lot. You see, there’s something about her that stops you from making your move, even though you’re single and she’s pretty. Instead you ask if she’s all right.', '“No,” she says. “I’m sorry, but I’m not all right at all. Something very bad is going to happen. Something terrible.”', 'You ask her what and she says she’s cold. So cold. A single drop of blood is dripping from her nose.', 'You’ve got to admit at this stage you’re wondering what on earth possessed you to pick up a hitchhiker in the dead of night. We all know this is going to end badly for at least one or both parties. Abortion. Divorce. An autopsy. But you don’t want to be a jerk like that. This lady, she might need help, and it’s you she ran into.', 'You wriggle your coat off—such a gentleman you are. You offer it to her. After she’s put it on she leans in and kisses you on the cheek. It’s a kiss as cursory as it is unexpected, and the immediate impression it leaves is how cold her lips are.', 'When you look again, she’s gone.', 'You know how the story goes.', 'Next day, there’s a strange phone call. They found your coat. The man on the line says he traced you through the membership card for the gym in the inner pocket. And you, you’re just relieved you’re not crazy after all. You’re relieved it was probably just a blackout and the only thing you can’t remember is where or when you let the lady with the nosebleed out. “We both must have forgotten,” you say, after you tell him what happened. “The coat. She really didn’t need to leave it for me. Some folks have a good heart.”', 'There’s a long silence. Then the guy, you hear him say, “Some hearts are bitch’n black.” The man on the phone is a caretaker at a graveyard. Not far from where you passed last night. This is the third time he’s found a coat, he says. A month ago, it was a scarf.', 'And he always finds them on the grave of the young lady who was found a year earlier, naked and dead in a ditch along the road. Hooked a ride with a black heart.', '♠', 'This story has been told a million times. The deets differ, but it’s always the same: A nocturnal hitchhiker mysteriously vanishes from a moving vehicle. Often with a piece of clothing taken and later found draped around a gravestone. In another version, the hitchhiker foretells seven years of deficiency before she vanishes. Look it up on Wikipedia. Urban legends, modern myths, they’re always the same.', 'I don’t believe in urban legends. Definitely not in ghost stories. That’s why I waited so long to tell mine. Tell you the truth, I tried to forget. But I can’t. At night, when I wake up alone, the memory cuts like a razor. And each time I remember, it seems worse, more sinister. I lie wide awake and cannot seem to move. I’m telling myself I won’t be thinking about it anymore in the morning. But the nights are long and pitch black.', 'Then, last night, the tables turned. There was this story on NewsOnline that told me I cannot way around it any longer. Someone had shared it on Reddit, otherwise I’d probably never have seen it.', 'So I’m telling it now, and like all urban legends, I’m telling it as a warning.', 'I can’t say jack about picking up hitchhikers, as I’m not a driver like the person in the story. I don’t even have my license. But wherever you are, do not try and get a ride after midnight.', 'Stay away from tunnels.', 'And beware of the Tall Lady.', '♠', 'There’s no good story as to why I ended up hitchhiking that night. Nothing to grant what happened some sort of poetic justice. You’ll have to cut me some slack here. I’d gone out in town, had drunk a shitload of beer, and skipped my ride home because I had my eyes set on this really pretty girl. I’d say smoking hot, but I don’t want to come across as out-and-out superficial.', 'I’m from Croatia, and the town in question is Opatija, a worn-out party town on the Adriatic Sea. This happened some Saturday night last March, at least two months before the tourist fuckfest. We locals still owned the pubs and nightclubs. All the girls seemed pretty that night, with crystal faces shimmering in the dim light, but my pet project had an irregular quality. An expression of melancholy that provided her with a flawed yet highly attractive beauty.', 'This girl, her name was Tamara. In Croatian, the rhythm is like Pamela. She came from one of the towns in the hills. I circled her all night, trying to grab her in an eye-lock. Yet her calm self-assurance and the hint of mockery on her lips instantly downsized me to a schoolboy. While I felt the Ožujsko crawling to my head, she was drinking biska, seemingly without getting drunk. I imagined her lips tasted like alcohol and mistletoe. That and her navel piercing when she was dancing and her top crawled up a tat, and I was a million sparkles exploding in my stomach. So by the time my ride home told me he was ready to leave, I took a considered gamble and said I wasn’t planning to sleep in my own bed that night. My face all Romeo bedroom smirk, I deliberately passed on the opportunity to get home.', 'You probably guessed it from the get-go: I crashed and burned. When we finally left the pub she rose to her toes and kissed me on the cheek. I figured I’d sway my arms around her and press our bodies close. But before I could, Tamara freed herself and lifted the hood of her bright red coat with the tips of two fingers. “I had a wonderful night,” she said, putting it over her head. Covering that hint of mockery around her lips in shadows. “I’ll send you a WhatsApp message.”', 'She turned around and off she went, her coat fluttering around her ankles like a cloak. And me, there I was. Watching my good luck walk away. Bewildered so much that I remembered we never gave out digits first when she was out of sight.', 'Smiling, I walked uphill, away from the town center. I didn’t know where I was headed. I had no money for a hostel. I appreciated the fresh air, but after a while it began to feel frigid, not fresh or crisp. My hands were numb and I slid them into my pockets. I watched my breath vaporize in alcohol-scented clouds that should instead have blown a little bit of soul in Tamara’s lungs. Such a waste. Loaded up, I was probably capable of walking all the way home—that is, until I’d sober up at wee a.m. out in the williwags, realizing I had a problem. I’d be trapped. I wasn’t dressed for the occasion and would suffer the consequences. Like, severe hypothermic consequences. Pneumonia. Paradoxical undressing. Now wouldn’t that be ironic. Anyway, it’d be sunrise before I’d make it to Istria. Before me awaited the long traffic tunnel underneath the Učka mountain.', 'I felt foolish for getting so far away from town. It was quiet. Quieter than expected. A little unsettling. So when I heard a car, I put out my thumb. It was an impulse. It’s a universal gesture and I’d never used it before, and it surprised me a little that it immediately did the trick. The car stopped. I was drunk enough not to hesitate when I got in.', 'The driver, this guy, he was a student from Jušići who had treated himself to a night out. Just like I had. He gave a low whistle when I told him where I was heading and took me to the Euro Petrol at the A8 turnoff. “It shouldn’t be too hard to hook a ride here,” he said. “A ride underneath Učka.”', 'I said thanks and raised my hand when he took off. I wondered if he too had hoped for something bigger that night.', 'The gas station was closed. I climbed up the entry ramp and reached the traffic lights. Here, beneath the halo of a streetlamp (', ', right), I figured my odds were best. My phone said it was one-o-seven. Every now and then, a car rushed by in either direction. Pushing my shadow ahead in quarter-circles like a runaway sweep–second hand. Time flies when you’re having zero luck hitching a ride. As it did, there were fewer cars and the stretches in between grew longer. Sometimes the A8 was quiet for minutes at a time. I’d listen to the wind or search for a glow on the horizon. On the ramp, no living soul had passed.', 'My breathing seemed loud, because it was so quiet. I felt misplaced. Like I didn’t belong here. Like I was a brand-new swing set in the yard of a burned-down farmhouse. It had textbook creepiness written all over it. I wiggled my hands in my pockets, jogged up and down the road divider, couldn’t keep warm. Couldn’t ditch that sense of unease, too. Suddenly I understood why: I wasn’t alone at all. There was somebody close. Across the motorway. Just outside the yellow light of the street lamp. It was a terrible feeling. This had never happened to me before. Something irrational like that. For a second or two it felt as if someone was standing right there on the rocky shoulder. Very close. Watching me. It was very real and very frightening. My heart was pounding. I was sweating heavily, despite the cold.', 'The sound of a car snapped me out of my dread. It came up the ramp, blinding me with its headlights, and here’s me, forgetting to wave my thumb. Fuckwit. The car rolled past me and stopped in the lane to Istria. The traffic light automatically turned green. Only when the window rolled down and a hand waved languidly did I realize the driver was waiting for me.', 'Quickly, I ran around the back of the car. A Toyota Prius in Blue Crush Metallic. License plate from Rijeka. That alone, I don’t know why it didn’t flash any alarms in my head. It should have, of course, considering what everybody had read in the papers. Considering the photograph everybody had seen. Maybe it was because the yellow streetlight changes that kind of clear blue. Yellow light has a sickening quality. Ever noticed that? It can tap the life out of a color until nothing remains but an indefinable and unwholesome complexion. The waving hand I had seen had been indefinable in that light as well. Unwholesome. Too late, I realized that its gesture could have meant literally anything. ', ' But also: ', 'I opened the car door and said, “Gee, thanks, I thought I’d never get a ride.”', 'Only a few seconds elapsed before I bent down to get inside the car, but in those few seconds I saw an image that for some reason is imprinted in my memory. There was a lady behind the wheel. This lady, I couldn’t see her face. It was hidden by the Prius’s roof. I could see everything below her face. Pale hands holding a black leather steering wheel. A coat so thick her body seemed to disappear in its folds. I don’t know why I remember this image so vividly. There was something completely run-of-the-mill about it and yet it seemed wrong in all sorts of ways.', 'Maybe it’s because I remember so few of her facial features. None, actually. Since the night this happened, my mind has constantly been on overload trying to picture exactly what this lady looked like. Whether she was old or young. The weird thing is that I cannot answer those questions. Weird, as the next thing, I sat down in the shotgun seat and could clearly see her. But no matter how hard I try to recap, the only thing I can say for sure is that she looked drained and bleak, with her breath visibly rising around her face. It was as cold inside the car as outside. The heater wasn’t on. That I noticed right away.', 'She gave me a quick glance. Didn’t shake hands, though. I wanted to reach out mine, but changed my mind. What’s common when someone offers you a ride? Is there such a thing as hitchhiker’s etiquette? Not to be rude, I repeated, “Thanks, for real. I appreciate you stoppin’.”', '“I do not like driving alone at night,” said my driver. The silence she dropped was too long. So long that I felt obliged to fill it in. But then she added, as an afterthought: “Especially when it rains.”', '“Well, at least it isn’t raining,” I said. It was a stupid thing to say. I knew that, but I was caught off guard. “I take it there are no streetlights higher up the road. Must get pretty dark out there.”', '“Yes, very dark. I can hear the rain before it falls.”', 'The traffic light had switched back to red. We were waiting for nobody.', '“It’s a hearing disorder. I hear a buzzing in my ears. First I thought it was just from earwax, but it’s not. It’s as if there’s a steady rain in the back of my head. It’s not very nice. Not very nice at all.”', '“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said. And added, because I didn’t know what else to say, “Must be a pain to drive alone with that.”', '“I drive alone every night. I was going to see Udur. Where you going?”', '“Me? To Vranja.”', 'I was hearing myself say this. Not having any control over it. Vranja was directly on the other side of the Učka car tunnel, you see. I didn’t want the lady to know I was going all the way to Pazin, more than thirty kilometers beyond. That seemed very important. The less she knew about me, the better off I would be.', '“Vranja. That sounds familiar. Udur must’ve been there, I think. I was going to see Udur.”', '“Cool,” I said. Trying to keep my voice casual. Not succeeding. “Who’s Udur?”', 'And another long silence. I didn’t think the lady would answer me. But she did, right as the light switched to green and she piloted the Prius onto the motorway. “Udur,” she said, “Udur is not a good man.”', 'I didn’t know how to process that information. Or why she had said it to me. It made me feel uncomfortable. Perhaps I could tell her maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to see Udur, if he was a bad man. What kind of name was Udur anyway? But I didn’t. I didn’t feel it was my place to poke my nose in her business. Plus she hadn’t said he was a bad man. She’d said Udur is not a good man. There’s a crucial difference.', 'The lady was fixated on the road ahead, pale-faced in the dashboard glare. I turned away, rolled my head against the window. Our speed was blurring the outside. The details of the peninsula were black. The Adriatic Sea an empty abyss. A lifeless dark chewing up the world around us. My seat cushion wasn’t comfy at all, giving me that quicksand sense as I sank in it. I moved my legs, but it was too cold to relax. I tried to focus on the glass vibrating against my forehead. It was strangely hypnotic. Like a brain massage.', 'I shouldn’t be here. At all.', '“You really don’t mind the cold, do you?” I said, rubbing my hands to emphasize my words.', '“The problem with Udur is that he lets things fall apart,” the lady said. Me, I was weighing the likelihood that she’d deliberately ignored what I’d said. “Udur had a dog. A sheepdog. But not anymore. If you look at him now you’d never think he had a dog.”', 'We were driving fast.', '“What happened to it?”', '“In the end it was very old. One eye was all milky from a cataract. We had to put it down.”', '“Aww,” I said. “Such a loss when you need to put your dog to sleep.”', 'The lady didn’t look at me as she was speaking. “They’re a real handful and expensive to keep. Especially a sheepdog. Udur is not a dog man.”', ', is what she said. Not ', '. I should probably have known better, but curiosity got the upper hand. “Did he get sick or somethin’? The dog, I mean.”', '“At that time, Udur had the baby. It’s not easy, you see, especially at night. The nights were worst. Sometimes it didn’t stop raining all night, and we could hear the baby cry in the barn. Anyway, Udur hadn’t checked on the dog for a few days. We’d left it on a leash. We used to just toss the meat in the pig trough, but the dog hadn’t touched it for days. When Udur finally went into the barn he said it was just lying there. The barn was old and there was a big hole in the roof. Even though the rain came pouring in and made the dog all muddy and wet, it wouldn’t move. Udur said the dog wasn’t looking well. Not well at all. Said it was staring back at him with one good eye, smelling all sweet and acrid. So he thought he better get it rinsed and inside. It was a big dog, a sheepdog, but still Udur wanted to try and lift it up. I told him, you shouldn’t. But he did anyway. When he turned it around, he found its belly was open and swarming with larvae. They were everywhere, roving the stains in its fur and the wet spots in its flesh and up and down its silly limbs like some flood of living disease. The dog was being eaten alive. From the inside out. And we never would have known if Udur hadn’t gone and checked on it. If it hadn’t been for the baby, crying.”', 'These words, this lady, that’s ', ' what she said.', '“I think it got infected with something. Began to rot. Udur tried to suture the hole back together but it didn’t work. In the end he had to hit it in the head with a hammer until it was dead. To put the dog out of its misery, give it peace. It was a most merciful thing to do.”', 'But I found nothing merciful or peaceful in the image the lady had cooked up. Besides, we’d been picking up speed all along as we were talking. I don’t think the lady realized how fast we were going. This was plain irresponsible on a two-lane road. It was too curvy. Too dark.', 'I tried to sneak a peek at my driver obliquely, didn’t want to show I was gaping up at her. She was tall. Very tall. Why hadn’t I noticed before? She seemed too tall to fit comfortably behind the wheel, but her posture was straight up. There was nothing sexy or attractive about her length. It unsettled me.', 'I noticed I was sweating again. Despite the cold. Maybe because of the cold. “It’s cool if you just let me out here, ma’am,” I heard myself say. But my voice sounded frail, the words swirling away from me. I wasn’t sure whether I had actually said them out loud.', '“Sometimes, my head is filled with buzzing,” said the lady. “It just doesn’t stop. I’ll never get used to it. It’s like there are voices in the rain. At least that’s what Udur says, but I know it’s not voices. It’s wasps.”', 'A car was coming. I tried to see the driver, but in the dark it was hard to make out anything. When it swooshed by, the blast of air shook the Prius and we swayed left and right.', '“Wasps,” she repeated. “I know because I’ve seen them. There’s a wasp in the center of the universe that’s bigger than all others. It crawls from star to star and when it finds you it stings. Its sting paralyzes you. You’re awake, but you cannot move. Like sleep paralysis, are you familiar with that? You feel it crawling all over you. Sometimes it crawls inside through the holes in your body, and you cannot stop it. It’s very frightening. I can feel it crawling on the inside of my skull right now. It’s laying eggs. In a while, its larvae will feed on me, too.”', 'Okay, that was it. I needed out. Now. I didn’t care that I’d be out on some shit road in the dark, alone, in the middle of fucked-up nowhere. I’d walk all the way back into town if I had to. As long as I could get away. Away from this lady. Something was terribly wrong. I didn’t want to look at her anymore. But I had to. I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed.', 'Her fingers groping the steering wheel. Slithering over its black leather cover. I suddenly realized that we’d been on cruise control all along. These fingers. Pushing a button. Again. On the display, digits switching from 102 to 108 and me hearing the motor accelerate. But that was not what was most alarming. There was something wrong with these fingers. They were not longer than before, but still, they looked like they were. Long and curved. Cold-cold blue. Almost dripping. And I noticed the tips had no nails. What had happened to her nails?', 'For a second, I thought I heard something move behind me. I froze. Suddenly I knew I wasn’t mistaken. It was not in my head. I heard a baby cry. At the sound, it felt like my scalp began to crawl over my skull. With a jolt, I turned to look where it was coming from. It was hard to distinguish anything on the rear bench in the dark, but behind the shotgun seat I could vaguely make out the shape of a strapped-in portable cradle. I hadn’t noticed it before. Something in it was moving. I couldn’t see what.', '“Something very bad is going to happen,” whispered the lady. I couldn’t believe how tall she was! I bounced back in my seat, squirmed away, my back against the car door. Terror filled me. Absolute terror. The lady, she was much too tall to fit inside the Prius, and yet she was sitting next to me, like an optical delusion. I think that’s when I knew. There’s something very similar to a living, healthy lady behind the wheel, but altogether different at the same time. It’s the equivalent of every ghost story you’d ever heard. For the first time since I’d entered the car, the lady looked at me again. Blood was dripping from her nose. “And I do feel the cold,” she whispered. “It’s always cold here. So cold.”', '“Let me out,” I said, my voice raw and hoarse. “Please, let me out of the car.”', 'We turned the last curve and in the distance, I saw the mouth of the Učka Tunnel. The motorway suddenly lit. A yellow, sickening glare. The mouth of the tunnel a dark hole in the mountain. Coming closer lightning-fast.', 'The light. It revealed everything. The dead lady behind the steering wheel. The paralyzed, hollow expression on her face. Her hands, so long that they reached all the way from the back of the driver’s seat to the steering wheel. Arms bent in all-impossible angles from her body. Again, she accelerated. We veered to the left. The lady sent the Prius into the opposite lane.', '“I was going to see Udur,” she said. “Now I’m stuck in the dark. You will see Udur too.”', 'These words, the motor roaring, the baby crying: a top-three of things I’ll never forget.', 'When I looked again, she was gone.', 'You know how the story goes.', 'The driver’s seat was empty. As if the lady had never been there. And the Prius was on a dazzling high-speed collision course with the concrete pillar left of the tunnel mouth.', 'It was a reflex. This was me. This was my second chance. That I lived to tell the tale was a twist of pure luck. Or maybe it was basic instinct. Fuck if I know. What I do know is it’s not common sense that saves you from certain disaster. It’s something much more primitive taking over. I remember yanking the wheel around. Missing the pillar by an inch. The car swayed into the tunnel, leaving twin smoking tracks of burned rubber. Inside, I was tumbling over the center console and caught by the safety belt, hearing a whiz-bang noise as the air escaped my lungs like a ripping bullet. The first thing I saw as my head popped up was the concrete slab on the right of the two-lane blacktop, dead-on in my headlights. I cranked the wheel back. The car bumping, joggling, onto the curb. Screeching metal. Sparks flaring up the dark like shooting stars. Another jolt, and I had the wheel in both my hands. Midway between catching fire and losing a door, the car bounced back onto the road. But we just kept on going, blazing deeper into the dark with unabated velocity. For a few seconds, there was a twitching, pile-driving sense of claustrophobia. A voice calling in my ears: ', 'Cruise control. Of course. How did you turn the fucking thing off? This too was a lucky reflex: reaching down, I pulled on the handbrake. Not having my license, I didn’t expect the counterpressure. It startled me, forcing me to let go. Now I understand that my lack of experience probably prevented the Prius from jackknifing or flipping over. Instead, I added pressure bit by bit. The Prius immediately slowed down. With a few jolts, the engine stalled and the car came to a stop.', 'Almost a minute went by before I could even move. The sudden silence was full of echoes. What had just happened? Incredulously, I realized that there had just been a point-blank assault on my life. The real possibility of a sudden death shocked me more than the vision of the impossible. It was the appalled disbelief of a swimmer being attacked by a bull shark: something like that only happened to others. Not me. This dead person I’d been alone with, she had wanted to drag me into her darkness. Forget subtlety. I had to get out of here. Right now. What if she came back?', 'The baby! I looked around. There was no cradle. No baby.', 'But it had been there.', 'I threw open the door and stumbled out of the car. It was unpleasantly cold inside the Učka Tunnel. It smelled of exhaust and crankcase oil. And something else. Something stale. I couldn’t identify what it was. Skittishly, I wheeled around. Wary of any sound, anything that moved. I took a few quick steps away from the car. The echoes of my footsteps making it seem as if I were being stalked by a regiment of ghosts. Beyond the intermittent puddles of bleak, yellow light I saw the entrance of the tunnel arching in the distance. The Prius had blasted inside for at least three hundred meters before it had come to a halt.', 'I didn’t move. The image of the blue Toyota Prius on the yellow center line brought home the photograph I should have remembered much, much earlier. The photograph that had dominated all the local papers and news sites. Last November. Suddenly, all the pieces fell into place.', 'It had been a similar car. Of course it had. A Toyota Prius in Blue Crush Metallic. Only this car, it was a wreck. It was smoking twisted metal with a cutting-edge dynamic tail chassis for athletic look and improved fuel efficiency sticking out. Doing at least one hundred ten, it had crashed into the side pillar of the Učka Tunnel mouth. The driver must have dozed off at exactly the time one didn’t want to. On board, two dead passengers: a student from Rijeka and an unknown baby. That was the first weird thing about the accident. This baby couldn’t be identified. No one was missing one. The gossip was that it was a family-tragedy suicide, the driver being the troubled mother. But that couldn’t be confirmed. That was the second weird thing: the driver’s body hadn’t been found. Only the baby and the student. The crushed remains of the latter had been strapped to the shotgun seat. Forensic investigation had ruled out the option that he could have been driving the car. But who could? And where was the body? Logic says there had to be a body. I’ve seen the photo. Everyone had. A human body cannot survive a blow like that.', 'Listening to the ticking of the engine, I tried to recall the facts. I remembered a desperate appeal to witnesses to come forward. If any did, they didn’t clear up the mystery. A few days after the accident, the ', ' had reported that the police were still in the dark about the origin of the Prius and the identity of its driver. It had struck me as strange. Why hadn’t the license registration shed any light? How come no CCTV footage from gas stations or highway cams surfaced with video of the blue Prius? There were simply no leads at all. Not even from the student’s mourning family. His being in that ill-fated car seemed a horrible coincidence. The student must have been hitchhiking. Hooked a ride with a black heart.', 'And here I was, staring at the Prius inside the tunnel, thinking there’s no such thing as a coincidence, and I didn’t have any doubts as to what had happened that night.', 'I needed to talk to somebody. Somebody alive. And I had to get out of the tunnel. There was something wrong with the air here. It had been standing still for too long. Outside, there’d be fresh air. And there was a long, long walk’s worth of fresh air ahead. It goes without saying I wouldn’t be flagging anybody down to catch a ride once I got out.', 'And yet I couldn’t put myself in motion. I was staring deeper down the tunnel where it banked away in a slow curve, beyond the reach of the headlights. There was something there. Something singing.', 'There was a baby crying.', 'The sound came crawling closer from afar. Echoing. Filling the tunnel. The terrible thing about it was that it had a basic human quality, but absolutely wasn’t.', 'My eyes were tearing up. I didn’t dare to blink. As if I could trap the thing coming closer in my vision. My feet were smarter than my brain and began to carry me backward. They had a will of their own. They saved my life.', 'What came closer, from the deep dark of the tunnel, was not human. It was her. The lady from the car. The Tall Lady. If ever there was a name for her, why not start calling her what she was? This lady, she filled the entire tunnel. So tall she was that she had to walk with her head bent forward. She spread her arms. Her no-nail fingers, pale and bare, scraping over the concrete walls on both sides of the motorway. Pulling grotesque shadows. She was singing. No, she was buzzing. Like a wasp.', 'I was in her dark. And she was still looking for company.', 'I remember I ran. I had never run so fast before. Jumping from light pool to light pool, chased by a terrible legion of echoes. Crossing the darkness in between as if I were flying. The light pools wouldn’t keep me safe. I had to reach the end of the tunnel before she could reach me.', 'Then I heard her. Right behind me. Her buzzing was filling my brain. And footsteps. Slow footsteps. When you have legs of such length, you don’t need to walk fast to move quickly.', 'Once, I looked back. The moment I did, all the synapses inside my cerebral cortex instantly stopped firing. I don’t remember what I saw. For real. This is not some sorry excuse not to talk about it. I feel it’s there, somewhere deep inside, but I can’t reach it. I’m grateful for it. When I try to think back on it, I see my vision is shimmering. I see something yellow crawling nearer over the tunnel’s ceiling. Something arthropodal? It’s probably imagination.', 'Suddenly I was out in the open. I didn’t stop running. I didn’t even look back. I just kept on going. My terror replaced by a sense of euphoria. Cool, fresh air swirling through my lungs. The very idea that I could run with the forest and mountains in my lungs, and even taste a hint of the sea, sent waves of energy through my body. Only after hundreds and hundreds of meters did I bend over, due to the stings drilling my gut.', 'The road behind me was empty. The mouth of the tunnel was dark. For a second or two I thought I could still hear a buzzing. A faraway cry from a baby. But it didn’t take long for me to figure it was a mere echo in my mind. It was quiet, underneath Mount Učka.', 'I would have given anything to sleep in my own crib that night. The next morning, I’d wake up and assume it had all been a bad dream. But then I would have to go back inside the tunnel.', 'Whether you end up having the money for a hostel is just a matter of priorities.', '♠', 'Five months later, I returned to the Učka Tunnel for the first time. It was on a sunny afternoon in August, but once you’re underground that doesn’t buy you anything. I tasted metal in my mouth as the bus entered the hollowed-out dark. I kept telling myself there was nothing foul inside the tunnel. It was just a motorway. Nothing else. Hundreds of thousands of cars had passed since that night. Avoiding Učka was just me feeding into my own fear. They say when you fall off a horse, you need to climb back on right away. I didn’t.', 'The morning after the incident I called my dad and he picked me up in Opatija. Told him I had a severe migraine and had spent the night in a hostel. When my dad slowed down for the A8 turnoff, I asked if he could take the mountain road instead. Said I needed the fresh air. The whole way across Učka I wondered if deep down inside the tunnel, the blue Prius was still waiting. Did they drag it away? Or had it simply not been there? Afterwards, I spent the whole spring and summer in Istria. Trying to convince myself it had just conveniently worked out that way. Coming back was a loaded impulse. I think I wanted to see if there was anything there.', 'There was nothing there. As I had expected.', 'Still, I don’t sleep well without my prescrip Zinodin since last March. Sometimes I wake up at night seeing that concrete pillar coming right for me, in that yellow, sickening light. Or I hear a voice whisper: ', ' And I admit there have been times I imagined seeing her. The lady from the car. The problem is I can’t always tell for sure if it’s imagination. One time I saw her in the parking lot behind the sound studio where I’m doing swing shifts. It edges onto woodlands. She was standing at the tree line. She didn’t move and was looking my way. Too far for me to see her face. I can never see her face. I mean, I haven’t seen her often. Only a few times. But I hate when it happens. She doesn’t do anything. She’s just standing there. Watching me. Why is she there?', 'I tried to relate the whole thing in the tunnel to my imagination. What else could I do? There was nothing to verify. Nothing to account for. This isn’t what a therapist will tell you to do, but I started reading obsessively about last November’s accident and, after a while, I started believing I had been doing so even before the incident. I reached a point where I realized how destructive my behavior was. I had to let go. If you can’t grasp a certain something, it’s better to forget. That doesn’t leave room for doubt.', 'But each time I try, I see the student’s face before me. The student from Rijeka. Igor Rendić was his name. His picture was in the ', '. He’s a friendly-looking guy. Thin-framed glasses, his black ponytail whipping behind him like some miracle visitation, he wears traces of a smile around his lips. I feel there’s a connection between us. He could have been me. I could have been him.', 'What did she tell him, during the last moments of his life? Did she put that hand with these pale, nailless fingers on his thigh, right before they crashed into the concrete?', 'About two weeks ago, I saw the lady again. She was standing at the foot of my bed without saying anything, for what felt like ages. Her bent arms reaching below her knees. When you wake up and cannot move due to sleep paralysis, such abstractions can seem very real.', '♠', 'So that’s my ghost story. You know how these stories go. I’m afraid there’s no such thing as a symbolic implication or satisfactory payoff. It is what it is. Like all urban legends, it counts as a warning. Except this is not an urban legend. It may look like it, but up close things are very different. Like a dog on a leash in a barn can seem perfectly all right at first, but upon close inspection is nothing but a deflating heap of flesh being eaten alive.', 'I’m going to post this online in a minute. If you’re reading these words, chances are you’re like me. You don’t believe in ghost stories. Chances are also you’re not from Croatia. Even when your subconscious leaves room for doubt—and let’s be honest, it does—you think you’re double safe.', 'That’s where you’re wrong.', 'Knowing how these stories go, you’d assume a ghost is loyal to the place she died. The question is: Who says it happened here?', 'Last night I stumbled upon this story on Reddit. There was a link to an article on NewsOnline, about a deadly car crash that happened the night before at the Weston Hills Tunnel in Hertfordshire. Just north of London. The car had lost a one-on-one with the concrete center column at the entrance. This article, it reported that the driver was catapulted through the windshield and killed instantly. He’d been the only victim. No details were provided about his identity.', 'I clicked on the photo. Zoomed in. Becoming inconveniently aware of my heartbeat thump-thump-thumping behind my temples. It was impossible there was a connection. And still. The car in the picture was a blue Toyota Prius. Blue Crush Metallic.', 'I didn’t see it. Not right away, at least. I was too absorbed by my gunfire heartbeat. There was a large, circular hole on the left side of the windshield. It looked like a hole in an ice-covered lake, through which a skater had disappeared. Around it, a spider’s web. And there I am, scrolling down the comments on Reddit. Looking at the picture again.', 'Of course.', 'In Britain, ', '. It would have been physically impossible for the driver to be thrown out the windshield on the left side, and leave a hole like that. Dude must have been sitting in the shotgun seat. That’s what the fuss was about on Reddit.', 'And that’s not all. I was up all night. Digging. Doing my own private detective shit. I had trouble keeping my hands from trembling. Clicking links, each time half-expecting to see her. A grainy image. A dash-cam pic. But I had to be sure. Collect evidence.', 'Over the last six months alone, similar fatal accidents have happened in the Belchentunnel in Switzerland, two in the Lefortovo underpass in Moscow, and at the Pontianak Tunnel on the E8 Expressway in Malaysia. What they have in common is that they all happened after midnight. It’s always a blue Toyota Prius. And it’s always unclear who was behind the wheel. The authorities in Malaysia are the only ones admitting the driver’s missing. As are the parents of the baby who happened to be on board, for that matter. In Switzerland and Russia, certain facts seem to have been deliberately withheld, despite public outcry.', 'None of these cases have been solved. But the victims are always hitchhikers.', 'That’s why I repeat: Do not hitch a ride after midnight.', 'Stay away from tunnels.', 'And beware of the Tall Lady.', 'You know how the story goes: The dead have highways. The dead travel fast. This lady, she’s always looking for company. She doesn’t like to drive alone at night, you see. She can hear the rain inside her head.

Hunched against the cold, Cally steered the dinghy between shoal and brickwork and the hulks of rusting cars.', 'Dull, fitful lights gleamed in the fog. Their maintenance was a low priority, as most of the pumphouse and lightship crews were airlifted on and off, but Cally had never liked helicopters; give her a small boat any day. ', ', Ben would have said.', 'The surviving parts of the city loomed like a black ridge of shadow to Cally’s right. The cliffs of the Suffolk coast were essentially banks of compacted gravel and sand. Even the gentlest tides wore them steadily away, and when storms raged or flood waters rose, another piece of land fell into the hungry waves.', 'There wasn’t as much recent wreckage farther out, and the water—even at low tide—was deeper. Cally sailed over houses, streets, and churches. A foghorn sounded in the mist.', 'A bigger, more powerful glow shone through the fog; Cally steered towards it, opening the dinghy’s throttle.', 'The ship emerged from the mist. Originally it had been painted red, but was now streaked green and orange by weed and rust. It rocked gently in the swell, tugging at its anchor chains. Above the peeling characters LVR36 on its side (light vessel relays were rarely graced with a proper name) a crewman waved from the deck.', 'On the ship’s seaward side, a wooden pontoon, secured to the hull by ropes and chains and kept afloat by a score of buoys, served as a crude but effective staithe. Cally moored the dinghy and climbed out. The boards were spongy and damp.', 'The docking station stuck out of the water by the pontoon, its side covered with barnacles, limpets, hanging rags of mussels and weeds. Around its top, at right angles to one another, were four circular hatches, one of which directly overlooked the staithe. Cally pulled on her thick gloves before climbing the ladder bolted to the side; the rungs were jagged with rust. At the top she spun the wheel in the centre of the recessed hatch and pushed it open.', 'On the other side of the airlock, a second ladder led down to the bottom of the forty-foot cylinder. The dull sun glimmered through the toughened glass panels in the hatches. Waves slapped against the module’s hull as Cally climbed down, so that it hummed like a struck bell.', 'Another airlock led into another metal cylinder, laid flat rather than on end. Rows of toughened glass portholes ran along the sides. Outside, fish wove in glittering swarms through the ruins of homes, cars half-buried in silt, the hulls of boats brought to grief.', 'Ben would have loved swimming through this seascape, studying whatever had made its home among the ruins. But Suffolk wasn’t like the Greek islands he’d loved—no white, sugar-soft sand to make love on, naked and shiny with lotion. Try that here, you’d end up with pneumonia. She carried on down the module to the transport station.', 'The station was a wide, squared-off structure, in which four golf carts stood with their bare wheels slotted into mounted rails. A plaque was mounted on the wall:', 'Dunwich', 'Cally saw herself in the polished brass: a small, lean woman in her late forties, deep red hair and a strong-boned face. Jeans, sweater, biker jacket, a grey butcher-boy cap. Out of place on ', ', but perfect for ', '.', 'The golf carts had no steering wheels, only half a dozen numbered buttons. Cally pushed one and leant back in the cart as it whirred along the rails, out of the station.', 'Cally’s ears popped as the cart travelled down the tunnel from the station, down the slope of the seabed. The view outside the windows dimmed and what submerged wreckage could be seen was sparser, more heavily overgrown.', 'The cart halted in another station. Cally opened the floor hatch and climbed down into the bridge.', 'The bridge was sixty feet across and thirty high; a broad railed walkway ran around it halfway up, where Harkness sat in her captain’s chair. The station commander glanced up, grunted, “Doctor McDonald,” and looked away.', 'Harkness’s dismissive greeting was a ritual now, albeit one that never failed to piss Cally off. ', ', ', ', she often felt like shouting. ', '. But her position here, all she had left of what she and Ben had tried to build, was allowed her less because she’d created the pumphouses than because accommodating her was no trouble. (Although occasionally, even Harkness would have grudgingly admitted, she was useful.)', 'So, as always, Cally said nothing and plodded across the bridge, boots clanking on the steel deck-plates. She zipped up her jacket; with a dozen wall fans in operation to prevent the computer systems overheating, the bridge was always cold. There was a low hubbub of human and electronic chatter, and a faint smell of rust and sweat.', 'Cally sat down at her desk in the corner. The transmitter had been automatically broadcasting throughout the night while she’d been ashore, the hydrophones recording. She uploaded the MP3 files to her laptop and skimmed through them, watching the recordings’ peaks and troughs. By now she was used to the sea’s speech patterns—sonar echoing off fish shoals, the clicks and whistles of dolphin pods, the dull thuds of mines and depth charges, the remorseless rise and abrupt peak of a Chorale. Nothing new; no answer to the calls she sent, over and over, into the depths.', 'Maybe there never would be. Maybe no-one listened, or no-one who cared. She wished for Ben, as she did a dozen times a day even now; for a moment, she almost felt his warm hand on hers. But only almost. Never truly. And that was never enough.', '“Cuppa, ma’am?” A fresh-faced naval rating proffered a steaming mug.', '“Thanks.” She smiled at him and he flushed a little, looking down. He was about twenty, less than half her age. Cally wondered if she should feel flattered.', 'The boy glanced over at Harkness, who was deep in conversation with Sub-Lieutenant Cannonbridge, the Gunnery Officer. “Can I, um, ask you something?” He was fair-haired and pale, with a face so unstamped by experience Cally couldn’t believe he was old enough to join up.', '“You can ', ',” she said.', 'He blinked. Cally took pity on him. “Course you can, love,” she said. ', '. That had slipped out before she could stop it. He turned even redder. “Ask away,” she said, “Mister…”', '“B-Baker,” he stammered. “Is it true you built this place?”', '“No.” Baker blinked some more. “I designed it with my husband. Of course, it was a lot smaller then.”', '“You designed ', '?” He looked thoroughly awed. Bless him. “Wow.”', 'HMS', ': the name stung. Cally shook her head. “It’ll always be ', ' to me. That’s the name Ben gave it.”', '“Ben?”', '“My husband.” She nodded around the bridge. “This was ', '—this, the module upstairs, a couple of others. They towed it out here on floats and sank it. And we showed them it could work.”', 'The pumphouse, originally no bigger than a couple of semi-detached homes, had expanded massively, till it now extended along several miles of the Norfolk and Suffolk coasts in both directions and almost five miles out to sea. A giant 3-D spiderweb of modules, crusted with weed and barnacles and glimmering with tiny lights, alone in the depths. Similarly, its original role as a scientific installation had been reduced to little more than a sideshow, a sop to its creator. Cally imagined it was like looking at a child that had grown up into a foul-mouthed, unruly teenager: barely recognisable as the fragile, beautiful thing she’d created, but she loved it, anyway, for what it had been.', '“Your husband?”', '“He was the diver.” Ben’s grin, his hair drying shaggy and salt-crusted in the wind and sun. Kisses on a Mediterranean beach, tasting of brine, beside a driftwood fire. “He got me into it, too. For fun, I mean.”', 'Baker raised his eyebrows. “Diving for fun? You’re brave.”', 'Was he flirting with her? “It wasn’t so dangerous, not back then,” Cally said. When she’d had youth, optimism, and a warm body beside her in bed at night. “Before all this. I was an engineer, and we came up with the pumphouse concept. Originally it was intended for sea exploration—even tourism. But—things changed.”', 'The war had begun, though they hadn’t realised it, but there’d been hope. Some scientists had continued to believe the first fatal encounters with the Bathyphylax were accidents, misunderstandings, but no-one listened to them—or, later, to those same scientists’ more accurate reports that the Bathyphylax’s actions, far from being motiveless acts of “evil,” were in fact in response to the ongoing destruction of their deep-sea habitats.', 'Cally sighed. “I miss it,” she said. “Diving. I’d love to be able to do that again. Maybe one day.” She nodded at her equipment. “If we ever get an answer.”', '“Can’t believe you’re still trying,” said Baker.', '“Yeah.” Pretty foolish, after everything that had happened since. “Something like it on most military pumphouses now. The Contact Programme. Kind of like the SETI Project, but using a narrow-beam transmitter instead of radio—generates a focused shockwave retaining a tight pattern over distance on a continuous loop…”', 'Baker’s eyes were glazing over. Cally trailed off; he blinked and coughed. “They ever answered?” he asked.', '“No. But I keep trying. Otherwise…” Cally gestured round. “This goes on till there’s no-one left.”', 'She knew how forlorn the hope sounded, but that wasn’t really the point anymore. People survived by internal mechanisms no less intricate than ', '’s own: Cally’s processed her grief into this lonely mission of hers, trying to squeeze some hope from the rags of her former life.', 'Baker glanced across the bridge, where Harkness remained deep in discussion with Cannonbridge. “So what are they like?”', '“Who?”', '“The Toads.”', 'Cally tried not to wince. Whether she liked it or not, it had become the term of choice for the Bathyphylax. The Greek name was a mouthful, after all; besides, it roughly translated as “guardians of the deep,” which was far too glamorous a name for an enemy you were supposed to destroy. “How should I know? No-one’s ever seen one.”', 'Baker chewed the inside of his mouth. “I know that’s what they ', '…”', '“Yeah, because it’s true,” said Cally. “Or if anyone ', 'ever seen one, I’ve never heard of it.”', '“But when the Russians nuked the Marianas Trench…”', '“They were fishing organic remains out of the Pacific for months afterwards, yes, but between decomposition and the radiation damage there was no telling what they’d come from. Half of it was probably ordinary marine life.”', 'If the Russians hadn’t nuked the Trench, the Americans or the Chinese would have done it. No matter how many warnings they’d been given of the dangers, no matter the contamination they’d known would spread. How much radiation was in the ecosystem now, seeding tumours in humans round the world? One might even be ticking away in Cally herself, killing at long range in both distance and time.', '“So what ', ' we kn—” Baker began.', '“Mister Baker,” Harkness snapped, “your duties don’t include idle chatter with civilians.”', 'Baker went the reddest he’d gone yet and slunk away with a mumbled apology.', 'What ', 'they like? All anyone had was guesswork. Cally had attended enough security briefings and, thanks to Ben, grasped enough about marine biology, to be up-to-date with current thinking. Despite the nickname, there was no consensus on Bathyphylax biology: depending on who you asked, they were marine amphibians (a minority view held by one professor from Massachusetts), intelligent octopi, whales, dolphins, or hive-minds of plankton, crustaceans or fish. There was widespread disagreement on much else, too, but it was generally agreed that their technology was organic in nature, due to symbiosis or genetic engineering, and they had, of necessity, a close relationship with their environment. Was it any surprise, then, that the ongoing pollution of the ocean—with sewage, plastic refuse, radioactive waste, dead zones and red tides—had been interpreted as an act of war?', 'So the war with the Bathyphylax raged on, and the humans’ leaders, at least, seemed to have no solution to offer other than genocide. And with Ben gone, all Cally had left of him was ', ', and her lone, seemingly futile task, transmitting her forlorn appeals for peace and negotiation out into black salt water…', '\\xa0', 'Three hours later, Cally looked up from her desk and called: “Commander?”', '“Yes, Doctor McDonald?”', '“Picking up a Choir.” Cally amplified the faint sounds the hydrophones had detected, reciting the estimated range and bearing. “Signal strength, level four.”', '“Why the hell did none of you lazy bastards get that?” Harkness barked. Cally half-smiled: ', ' had its own listeners, of course, as its whole ', 'was defending the coast against the Choirs, but no-one had been listening to the sea—and the Bathyphylax—as long as she. “I want that signal triangulated now. I want its position, and I want to know where that wave’s going.”', 'Cally isolated the Choir’s sound, breaking it down for analysis on her laptop. “It’s a big one,” she said. “Three hundred component voices, minimum. At that range it’d be level six or seven if it were facing us, so it’s at right angles, at least. Which puts it in line with”—she brought up an interactive map of the East Anglian coastline on the laptop screen and marked positions—“the area between Lowestoft and Yarmouth.”', '“Get that confirmed,” said Harkness. “Mister Cannonbridge, have all songun batteries stand by.”', '“Picking up two more Choirs,” said Cally, “same approximate range and strength.”', 'Harkness snatched up a telephone. “LVR?” she said. “', ' Actual. Alert Coastal Command. Three, repeat three, Choirs targeting east coast. Coordinates to follow.”', '“Second Choir’s targeting the Wash,” said Cally. “Number three’s lined up with Harwich Harbour.”', '“Jesus,” someone said. A level six wave-strike on the Wash would devastate King’s Lynn, Boston, and Skegness; a strike on Harwich Harbour would not only destroy the port, but send massive bore-waves up the Stour and the Orwell, perhaps even as far as Ipswich. “Estimate co-ordinates as follows.”', 'Triangulation was the tried and true method of pinpointing a Choir’s location, but given experience, a good ear, and some idea of its size, you could estimate the Choir’s range and bearing with some accuracy. Harkness relayed Cally’s figures to the LVR. “Tell Coastal to get their planes airborne,” she said, “and stand by for confirmation.”', 'Lieutenant Sugulle, the First Officer, ran up and gave Harkness the final coordinates: they were a near-match to Cally’s. She nodded to herself. Maybe there was another reason Harkness kept her aboard, not that the Commander would ever admit it.', 'Harkness gave the LVR the final co-ordinates. “Seek and destroy,” she said. “Mister Cannonbridge, I want full songun cover for Harwich and the Wash.”', '“Already done, ma’am.”', '“Bloody smart-arse.”', 'There was a weak ripple of laughter at that, then only silence: nothing else to do now but watch, and wait. For the Coastal Command aircraft to find the Choirs and for the first round of wave-strikes, which the aircraft would be far too late to prevent.', 'The Choirs grew louder as they accumulated kinetic energy, ready to release it as a shockwave that would displace tons of water. They were at full volume now, and the longer they “sang,” the bigger the wave would be.', '“It’s gonna be a big fucker,” someone said.', '“Belay that,” said Harkness. “Mister Cannonbridge, are the songuns at full power?”', '“Songun batteries fully charged, reserves at maximum. Ready to divert additional power from non-essential systems if required.”', 'Harkness nodded.', 'The Choirs droned on. Cally had never known one to go on this long. Then her hydrophones picked up a dull ', ', like a huge clock’s chime.', '“Here it comes,” said Harkness.', 'Another ', ' sounded, then another. Out to the east, the waves would be rising. They’d be little more than thick ripples in the water to begin with, a foot high at the most.', '“Coastal Command have visual,” called Sugulle. “LVR relaying signals from DART buoys now. Three wave-strikes, all sixth magnitude.”', '“Same bearings?”', '“Yes, ma’am.”', '“Over to you, Mister Cannonbridge.”', '“Ma’am.”', 'A screen on one of the bulkheads depicted the feed from LVR36. Tsunami warning buoys, out at sea, picked up changes in water depth and sent the information, via satellite relay, to the LVR, which generated a composite image of the impending wave-fronts. They were surging landwards now, growing wider and thicker. When they reached the shallows at the coast, the foot-high ripples would become fifty-foot waves.', 'Cannonbridge watched, arms folded. He was, Cally had to admit, an artist when it came to deploying the songun batteries. The songuns weren’t, strictly speaking, sonic weapons, but a more powerful variation on the Contact Programme’s shockwave transmitters. At close range, they could crumple or even punch through light armour, but their main use was breaking up wave-strikes before they could come ashore.', 'Effective though they were, they were the aspect of ', '—as opposed to ', '—Cally loathed above all others. They embodied, more than anything else, how her and Ben’s creations had been weaponised. Even the lives they’d saved couldn’t change that.', 'Cannonbridge picked up a phone. “Batteries One through Eight, you’re A Group,” he said. “Target midpoint of wave-front bearing on Yarmouth sector. Batteries Nine through Twenty-one, you’re B Group: target midpoint of the Harwich wave. Batteries Twenty-Two through Thirty—C Group—midpoint of wave approaching the Wash. Stand by to fire on my mark. All other batteries are D Group. You’re on mop-up duty today.”', 'The wave-fronts expanded, thickened. Cally clutched the arms of her chair.', '“A Group, fire,” said Cannonbridge. There was a dull boom as songuns discharged, and ', '’s hull shivered and hummed. Cally’s screen jumped and flickered; she looked up at the wall-screen and the thick, fuzzily glowing bracket of the first wave-front.', 'A foggy, whitish blur bloomed in the centre of the bracket, as the songun volley hit home. The bracket broke apart into two smaller, thinner brackets. As they sped on, the blur kept expanding, fading as it did.', '“D Group, fire at will,” said Cannonbridge. Another shudder ran through ', ', and one of the smaller waves fuzzed and crumbled away as the other songun batteries, spread throughout the pumphouse’s sprawling structure, opened fire.', 'The songun blasts put solid fists of water through the wave-fronts, breaking them into smaller, weaker fragments. ', ', indeed: even the name felt tainted. However necessary ', 'might be, it was part of the machine driving humankind and the Bathyphylax towards mutual destruction.', 'B and C Groups fired, smashing through the Harwich and Wash wave-fronts. Cannonbridge directed further salvos at the half-dozen dwindling brackets that had been the Yarmouth wave; they, too, blurred and dissolved before they could hit the coast.', 'The songuns kept firing. One by one, the wave-fronts broke apart and faded to nothing. ', ' began to rattle and rock afresh—not to the hammered-out rhythm of the songuns, but the random surging of a sea stirred into fury by both sides’ fire and counter-fire. Heavy waves would still crash against the East Anglian coast tonight. Roads and farmland would be flooded, homes washed away, lives lost. Another chunk of the land might fall into the sea. But all that was as nothing to the havoc the wave-strikes would have wreaked had they come ashore. Cally had seen it firsthand.', '“That’s the lot,” said Cannonbridge at last. He looked grey-faced, tired. The battle—if it could be called one—had lasted minutes, and yet it had felt like hours—longer, perhaps, to him.', '“Sir?” Sugulle. “Coastal Command. Strikes carried out on Choir positions. They’re dropping salvage markers now.”', 'In the morning, when the waters had calmed, ships would search for remains. Not that there was much point. They’d never found anything yet, and even if they did, how were you supposed to tell the remains of a Toad from a piece of their technology?', '“Good work, everybody,” said Harkness, and gave Cally a nod. “Doctor.”', 'Cally tipped her butcher-boy cap at her. Harkness turned away with a faint facial twitch—a smile or maybe indigestion, Cally couldn’t decide.', '“That was amazing.” Baker stumbled over to her. The boy almost looked drunk. “You were brilliant.”', '“Thanks.”', '“Buy you a drink at the Mariner’s when we get ashore?”', '“Eh?”', '“You know the Mariner’s Rest?”', 'It was a pub, not far from Cally’s static caravan—she lived on land commandeered by the Navy, so it was a popular drinking spot with the Jack (and Jane) Tars. “Oh, yes. Been there a couple of times.” In the afternoons, when the Navy boys wouldn’t be in there getting drunk.', '“Well, maybe go for a drink there?” he mumbled, turning an even brighter shade of red than before. Dear God, she hadn’t imagined it; he ', ' hitting on her. Cally, knowing how easily hurt a young man’s pride was, did her best not to laugh—but then Baker’s smile faded: he was staring past her at the laptop screen.', 'She turned and looked. “Oh, ', 'Commander!”', '“What is it, Doctor?” Harkness was back to her usual tone of bored disdain.', '“I’m picking up another Chorale,” she said. “No, make that two.

And big—five, six thousand voices each.”', '“Christ’s sake,” Harkness snapped at Sugulle. “Can’t you pick ', ' up first? Well, then? Range?”', 'Cally didn’t answer. Her stomach was hollow, sucked empty by what was on her screen.', '“Doctor McDonald?” Harkness was used to immediate answers. “I asked you a question.

She unlocked hers and strapped herself in.', 'The bridge rocked and juddered—not the big shockwave itself, of course, only the rumblings before it hit. Then the bridge lurched sideways, and Cally would have flown out of her seat if not for the harness.

Water jetting through buckled plating, a haze of it filling the air. Someone was shouting, ', '. She fumbled at the seatbelt on the chair, tugged it to make sure it was secure.', '“Get that leak sealed,” Harkness shouted, and then the second wave hit. The bulkhead behind her caved inwards, driving Harkness into the catwalk railings with a wet crunch. The bridge shuddered, canting sideways. Rivets popped, and more water spewed into the module.', '“Abandon bridge,” Sugulle shouted. He was next in command. “Mister Baker, evacuate Doctor McDonald. Everyone else, to the auxiliary control module.” He grabbed the phone. “', ' to LVR—”', 'A third impact shook the bridge, but it was fainter—the main blast had passed them by. They were targeting the LVR too, Cally realised, to leave ', ' unable to communicate with land or air.', 'Cally’s harness wouldn’t unlock. She thrashed against the straps, close to panic. “Hold on!” It was Baker, sawing at the harness with a knife. “Move it,” he shouted as the straps gave way.', '“LVR36?” Sugulle yelled. “LVR, do you read?”', 'Baker pulled Cally from the chair. Her cap fell to the deck; she bent and grabbed it, then stumbled after him across the bridge. He ignored the ladder above—even if the transport carts were working, the LVR was almost certainly gone, and with it the pontoon, Cally’s boat, and more than likely the docking station too. Even if Cally’s boat had somehow survived, between the wave-strikes and the songun salvos the sea would be a holocaust that no surface vessel short of a warship would last long in.', 'Instead, Baker would be leading her deeper into the pumphouse complex in search of an evacuation pod. Cally had designed them to get crew off a damaged pumphouse and first to the surface, then to shore, alive.

Cally had soon lost her bearings, but Hanover never seemed thrown for a second.', '“Here we are,” she called at last, opening a ceiling hatch. “Nearly home and dry.” She looked back, grinned at Cally. “Emphasis on the ', '.”', '“Amen to that,” Cally muttered, though she expected Hanover would be even gladder. The Chief Petty Officer’s damp clothing clung to her tightly, and particularly to her firm, round bottom, which Cally had a fairly magnificent view of as it swayed above her on the ladder.', 'She’d never made a secret of her sexuality with Ben. University had been where she’d begun to shake off her rather repressive religious upbringing; unlike some, she hadn’t shagged everything that moved, but there’d been a couple of longish relationships, and for one awkward month she’d secretly dated a lean, pale dyke called Paula. It hadn’t lasted—Paula had, understandably, wanted a girlfriend who wasn’t afraid to be seen as one, and Cally had been far too concerned about her parents finding out and the reaction of the church congregation back home. A pity. Paula had been a nice girl and a good lover. Come to think of it, Hanover looked a little like her.', 'A few years out from college Cally had met Ben, and that had been that: bi or not, she was the old-fashioned monogamous type, despite all Ben’s half-serious joking about threesomes. The emotional intimacy she’d shared with Ben had been what mattered. Of course she’d felt desire since he’d died, but it had never been anything more than an itch to scratch. In so many ways, she knew, she was frozen at the point of loss, unable to move on; she couldn’t remember the last time a flesh-and-blood human had inspired any lust in her.', 'Until now, when she was responding to Hanover’s lean, lithe body as she hadn’t in years. Looking at those buttocks swaying above her, Cally pictured them bare and white—and beneath them, at the juncture of Hanover’s thighs, the ripe swell of the ', 'the lush thatch of wiry black hair—', ', ', '.', 'Hanover hung one-handed from a ladder rung above her. “You okay down there, Doc?”', '“Fine.”', '“Looking a bit flushed.” Hanover grinned. “Let me know if you need cooling down.” And then she was back to climbing: did Cally imagine it, or did the other woman put an extra wiggle in her behind? Cally shook her head and followed. Maybe Hanover had good gaydar and wanted to add a little extra motivation. If so, Cally had to admit, it wasn’t doing any harm.', 'Hanover reached the airlock above and opened the outer hatch. “Oh, shit,” she said. Before Cally could ask what had happened she no longer needed to—thin streams of cold salt water trickled down from above.', '“Flooded.” Hanover slammed the hatch and locked the wheel. “Back the way we came, Doc, and fast.”', 'Cally’s foot slipped as she climbed down, and she cried out, falling. “Whoa!” yelled Hanover; Cally wasn’t sure quite what she did or how, but a strong arm snagged her around the waist, pulling her close up against Hanover, whose free hand gripped the rung above Cally’s head, her booted feet braced against the wall.', '“Jeez,” said Hanover. Hot breath, a little sour, but with a hint of spice that wasn’t unpleasant at all. “Don’t go scaring me like that, Doc.”', 'They were two or three feet above the deck. Cally felt the heat of Hanover’s body, the strength of her arm, the warm deep dark of her eyes. ', ', Cally thought, and for a moment it seemed Hanover really would, but instead she said, “No point hanging around,” and let go of the rung. They landed in a crouch, or rather, Hanover did. Her grip prevented Cally from going sprawling.', 'Cally wriggled free, brushed herself down, and stood up straight. “Where now? There’s got to be some more pods somewhere.”', '“There’s an evac point not far from here,” said Hanover, “but it was right under the power plant. Chances are that’s gone too. Next nearest’s in T-8. Good-sized trek, and fuck knows what state the place is in between here and there. Longer we’re down here…”', '“…the worse the odds get,” said Cally. The pumphouse shook and shifted, and there was a faint, far-off rumble as another part of the structure failed. And then ', 'was back at rest, at least for now. “So we get to T-8 ASAP?”', '“ASA', 'P,” Hanover corrected. “C’mon.”', 'The next few hours were a weary blur—tramping down corridor after corridor, climbing up or down ladder after ladder. They went forwards, sometimes backwards, sideways, upwards, left and right. No sooner did they detour around one obstruction and get back on course, they’d encounter another flooded or destroyed section. The constant stop-and-start was more tiring than continuous walking would have been.', 'During one brief stop, Cally looked out through the porthole at the devastation wreaked by the attack. Modules lay crumpled and torn apart, and the structure sagged and listed. Sometimes a flurry of silver bubbles would escape as a seam or seal gave way and the sea rushed in. And then another shudder would rumble through the damaged structure as another part of it grew heavier, and fresh creaks and groans would sound.', 'The rest of ', ' was visible only by the fitful glow of rig-lights through the murky swell—the sea was heaving and debris swirled around the pumphouse. In it Cally could make out human shapes. They looked as though they were dancing, but it was only the current, working their limbs like a puppeteer.', 'What if she couldn’t get to an evac pod? Bail out of a hatch and hope for the best? Even with diving gear, those waters would either drown her or fling her up to the surface too fast, to endure a death like Ben’s. Christ, better to drown than that. Either way, though, if there ', 'anything afterward—silly to believe it, she knew, but that didn’t kill the hope—she’d be with him.', '“Come on, Doc.” Hanover clapped her on the shoulder.', '“Call me Cally, okay?”', 'Hanover smiled. “Okay. Cally.”', '“What do I call you?”', '“Plenty of options. Chief, Bitchface, Slut Puppy—”', '“Slut Puppy?”', 'Hanover winked. “I’ll never tell.”', '“Haven’t you got a first name?”', '“Course.” Hanover started down the corridor. “My friends call me Jen, D— Cally. Now, best foot forward. If we’re home in time, you can buy me a double Kraken at the Mariner’s Rest.”', 'Cally laughed. “Be glad to.”', 'Cally lost count of how many sections they’d passed through before Hanover said anything else. “We’re getting close, Doc. Should be there in—”', 'She broke off, holding up a hand. The pumphouse’s creaking and groaning was getting louder and higher—and closer.', '“Shit,” said Hanover. “This is it.” She went to the porthole, and Cally saw her tense up. The section they were in shuddered, tilting.', '“Down here.” Hanover grabbed Cally’s arm, flung a floor hatch open. “Move that sexy bum of yours, Doc.”', ' Cally fought back panic-laughter as she scrambled down the ladder. The pumphouse juddered and rumbled. The ladder tilted towards her. “Oh, shit!”', '“She’s going,” Hanover yelled above her, as ', '’s groans of torment rose to a scream. “Get down that bloody ladder.”', '“I can’t.” Cally could barely hold on.', 'Hanover pressed against her from behind—how had she climbed down so fast?—closing her hands over Cally’s. “There’s a Type Two through there,” she shouted as she helped Cally descend. The Chief Petty Officer’s breasts were against Cally’s back, while her lap was pressed to the rump Hanover had praised seconds before. “We need to make it there before—oh, ', '.”', 'The module fell sideways, halting with jerks and cracks. Cally cried out as the impact bounced her about like a rag doll. if Hanover hadn’t been pinning her in place, she’d have gone flying.', '“Up,” Hanover shouted. “Stand.” Water roared; metal split and screamed.', '“Watch out for the rungs,” said Hanover: the ladder was now part of the floor. Cally moved to one side of it and followed Hanover towards the hatch.', 'The floor tilted anew, this time back and down. Cally swayed, arms pinwheeling as she fought not to pitch backward. “Fuck—”', 'Hanover had seized the rungs, steadying herself as the section continued tilting. It was going vertical again. Cally lunged forward and grabbed hand- and footholds as the module swung down, jolted to a halt with a thud—almost perpendicular, but not quite, and upside-down.', 'Cally’s feet slipped from the rungs; she shouted in pain as her full weight fell on her arms. She kicked at empty air while, above her, Hanover struggled towards the hatch.', 'The pumphouse bellowed like a wounded Leviathan and the fluorescents inside the module flickered. So did the rig-lights outside, but in their glare Cally saw at least three other modules, joined together, sinking down towards them, finally coming down on top of their refuge.', 'Metal groaned. Bulkheads swelled inwards. Rivets pinged. A porthole shattered and water slammed through it into the opposing bulkheads. The electrics became mad, flickering strobes, and one set went out. The air turned hazy from the spewing water; Cally tasted salt and dead fish. She was drenched in seconds, to the skin: it was like being plunged into ice. Her cap, now sodden, threatened to slide off. She shoved it through her belt.', 'The hull bulged in further. Already the bottom three or four feet of the module were submerged. Cally’s teeth chattered.', '“Get up here!” Hanover was opening the hatch above. “It’s gonna go any sec.”', 'Cally found a foothold and climbed. There was a ', ', and something flew past her face before ricocheting off the plating beside the rungs. “Fuck,” she muttered, and climbed on.', 'She’d almost reached the top when, with a piercing shriek, a split opened in the hull. More water blasted in. It rose faster, closing around Cally’s ankles. Searing cold: her feet lost all sensation in seconds. Her fingers, too, grew thick and numb.', 'The metal surface under her buckled inwards. The ladder bent and snapped, and the section Cally clung to hinged backward. She lost her footing for a second time, and her left hand’s grip broke. She hung on with her right, but inch by inch, her fingers slipped from the rung. The water rose icily around her calves, then to her knees; the module was filling, and the bulkheads groaned louder.', 'Hanover swung down from above her, dangling one-handed like a monkey. “Grab hold!” she yelled, extending her free hand. Her breath steamed in the bitter air. It met and mingled with Cally’s. “Haven’t got all day.”', 'Cally caught Hanover’s hand with her flailing left. The jagged end of the broken ladder snagged Hanover’s forearm; the sleeve of her coverall opened and she grunted in pain. Blood trickled down the metal, but she didn’t let go. Hanover pulled, lifted Cally free of the ladder. Her teeth were gritted, the cords standing out in her neck. Cally could see her biceps bulging under the wet coverall sleeve. Hanover dug her boots in and braced herself, then pulled Cally upwards till they were face to face.', 'Cally’s feet and calves were already almost completely numb, but she felt the freezing water rise to her ankles, then her knees, as the module’s hull buckled further. Each breath of icy air seemed to scorch her lungs. She flung her arms around Hanover’s neck and clung tight as the other woman carried her up into the airlock like a bundle of rags. ', ', ', 'strong.', 'With a last tormented groan, the module’s hull crumpled inward. Wind blew up into the airlock and water was squeezed up through the hatch. “Move!” said Cally, climbing to the far end of the airlock. She realised that, as before, she’d forgotten to look through the glass panel before unlocking the wheel, but it didn’t matter—if this section was flooded, they were finished either way.', 'The hatch opened with a gust of warm stale air. In the dim water below, the flooded module finally went dark.', 'Cally crawled out through the hatch and collapsed onto a rough metal deck. She was shaking, her teeth chattering. Her lungs burned, her heart hammered dizzyingly, and she felt sick.', 'Behind her, Hanover’s boots thumped on the rungs, then the hatch clanged shut and the wheel creaked. A moment later Hanover dropped to her knees, then onto her front, beside Cally. A strong arm fell across Cally’s shoulders, squeezing her close, and Hanover let out a whoop that echoed from the walls. “We made it, Doc.”', 'Despite the shaking and the cold, Cally smiled. “Thought you were going to call me Cally.”', '“Cally, then.” Hanover turned her head so their faces touched, and grinned back. “Made it.”', 'And then the lights went out.', '\\xa0', 'A washed-out wraith-light bled into the pumphouse through the portholes for nearly a minute before the external lighting died too.', 'By then, Cally had crawled to the porthole. What remained of HMS ', 'fallen, crushed and broken sections, furred over with weed and barnacles—resembled the ruins of a drowned, ancient city. The few remaining lights were dying out one by one as she watched, and the darkness flooded the pumphouse ruins like a second, blacker sea.', 'The marrow-deep chill that already gripped Cally sank deeper. Shivering, she saw faint movements in the murk. Were they fish, seaweed, bodies, or incoming Bathyphylax? Might she be about to see one, before she died? And were there ships and helicopters, up above, looking for them? Unlikely, with the rest of the damage they’d be dealing with. The thought of that devastation gave Cally a sick, queasy chill: the loss and pain of Ben’s death, repeated on a vaster scale.', '“Got your phone?” Hanover whispered. “Mine’s fucked.”', 'Cally fumbled in her pockets with thick shaky hands, and found her mobile—an old-fashioned clamshell model, primitive but sturdy, that had outlasted any number of more advanced models over the years. “You won’t get a signal down here,” she said.', '“I look thick? Trying to find my way around and—ow!”', '“You okay?”', '“Yup.” Hanover flicked the phone open and the screen’s watery glow lit her face. She shone it around. “Found the locker… ah, shit.”', '“What?” All Cally saw was the phone’s pallid glare glinting dully on the deck. She sank down against the bulkhead, hugging her knees. Her clothes pulled her down, like ice-ridden weights. Had to get them off, but too tired.', '“Emergency supplies,” said Hanover. “They keep a locker full of them in all the Type Twos.”', 'Cally had been only dimly aware as she’d sprawled on the deck that she’d been in a larger, squarer module. “At least we got here.”', '“Yeah,” said Hanover, “but it’s as far as we go tonight.”', 'Tonight—of course, that why it was dark. Then she realised what Hanover had said. “What?”', 'The phone shone on broken clear and red plastic. “We ', 'some electric torches here, but they’re fucked.

Crushed them to bits.”', '“First aid kit?” said Cally.', '“Still there.”', '“Pass it over, then. You cut your arm open—”', '“No offence, hun, but I’ll patch myself up.”', '“Okay.” Cally felt stung. Hanover’s strength and confidence were very attractive, but she’d have liked to have felt capable of ', '—since meeting the other woman, Cally had either been tagging along after Hanover or being rescued by her. Did she really seem so useless she couldn’t even tie a bandage?', '“Nothing personal, chica,” Hanover said. “Prefer doing it myself, that’s all.”', '“You must have had some very disappointing exes.”', 'There was a pause, then a fairly alarming snorting sound. Cally realised Hanover was laughing. “A few.”', 'Cally held back from asking whether they’d been male or female. “We’re really stuck here?”', 'Hanover sighed. “It’s pitch black out there, hun, and God knows what state the rest of the place is in.”', '“Could use the phone.”', '“What drugs are you on, Doc? The glow’s piss-weak, and the battery’s nearly out anyway.”', '“So what do we ', '?” Cally heard a whine creeping into her voice and feigned a cough to hide it, but it turned into an actual coughing fit.', '“Jesus! You okay?”', '“Fucking freezing.”', 'Hanover moved closer. “No shit, babe. Get out of those wet things. There’s a blanket somewhere. Have to share it, but it beats hypothermia.”', '“I can live with that,” said Cally as she fumbled with her clothes, wondering how much of her true feelings her voice gave away.', '“Me too,” Hanover said; her tone suggested Cally’s voice had told her all she needed to know. “Stay put.”', 'Cally, now in her underwear, felt her heart quicken. Hanover crawled over. A hand touched Cally’s knee, then her shoulder—a few more inches and it would have found her breast. “Hiya,” said Hanover, and sat against the bulkhead beside Cally. The Chief Petty Officer felt as cold as she did at first, but with the blanket securely wrapped around them both, the heat of Hanover’s body slowly began to warm Cally, even through the clothing the other woman still wore. To Cally’s surprise, the coverall was almost dry.', '“Here’s what we do,” said Hanover. “Wait till it’s dawn, then head for T-8.”', '“Wait? But the place is falling apart.”', '“It already has.

So things’ll be calming down. Means we’re safer staying put than if we go blundering around in the dark. Sounds mad, I know, but it’s true.”', 'Cally settled against Hanover, closing her eyes, then reopening them. “The air.”', '“Mm?”', '“Backup batteries are in powersave. Why the lighting’s out.” Cally spoke thickly. She could barely keep her eyes open.', '“Yeah, Doc, I know. My job, remember?”', '“The air purification system,” she mumbled, drowsily.', '“Don’t freak out,” said Hanover. “We’re good for twelve hours, maybe twenty-four. I only make it four hours till dawn. Five at most till it’s safe to travel. We’ll make it, chica.”', 'Hanover sank against Cally. Understandable enough. She must be exhausted after all she’d done. Lifting Cally up like a toy. Heat bled from her; she was so ', ', thought Cally. In every way. She huddled closer to Hanover under the blanket, caught a whiff of Hanover’s breath, that odd, but not unpleasant, spicy smell. Necessity, of course, nothing more: they had to have warmth or die.', 'Cally was never able to pinpoint the moment it became something else. Dimly, she felt fingers stroke her hair.

If any past love’s memory intruded, it was Paula’s: the two of them undressing one another in her flat that first time, with scented candles and Melissa Etheridge on the stereo. Cally lying back shy and afraid while strong, tender hands stroked and woke and opened her till her hands and lips and tongue came alive too, hunted and explored. The darkness only heightened the pleasure, made each touch a thrill; they made love in silence so that there was no other sense to navigate by. Cally only cried out once, clutching Hanover tighter. Minutes later, Hanover broke her silence too, with a shriek higher and full of more abandon than Cally had thought her capable of.', 'After that, sleep returned. And Cally, still in Hanover’s arms, drifted off on the waves of a deeper, darker sea.', '\\xa0', 'A smell of the sea, a touch of light on Cally’s eyelids, but the dawn was cold. Strange. It was summer, wasn’t it? Summer, and she was in bed with Ben. But no, that was wrong: it was November. And she wasn’t in bed, either, but under a blanket, huddled against a cold steel bulkhead. And she wasn’t with Ben.', 'Although, she thought, studying Hanover’s—Jen’s—sleeping face in the undersea dawn, she could have done worse.', 'Cally felt stiff and sore from the posture she’d slept in, and was shivering. There’d been no keeping the cold out completely and the burning sensation she felt with each breath hadn’t gone away; if anything, she thought it was worse. She felt other kinds of soreness, though, which weren’t entirely unpleasant. She smiled to herself, glancing sideways at her sleeping—companion? lover?—she didn’t know what to call Hanover yet, or whether last night had been the start of something or its beginning and end. Cally was content to let that question wait: for now, she was happy to enjoy the warmth of Hanover’s half-clad body against hers.', 'Or she would have been, if she hadn’t now been fully awake. The early morning cold and damp rapidly made her position uncomfortable, and she needed to know how things stood in the (very bloody) cold light of day. More importantly, she had to pee.', 'Pearlish, wavy light shimmered on the floor as Cally emerged from under the blanket. She immediately gasped in the cold air; in seconds she was shivering. She crawled to the furthest corner of the module, squatted and peed. Hanover shifted position and started snoring, but thankfully didn’t wake.', 'Cally retrieved her clothes. They were cold and damp, and she winced as she put them back on, but she wasn’t as cold as she had been. In fact, her forehead felt hot to the touch, she smelt rank with sweat, even to herself, and there was a cellophane-y crackle in her chest when she breathed in.', 'She squinted through a porthole. The sea was a grey murk, like a duller, darker version of the mist she’d sailed through to begin her final watch on ', ', one night and an eternity ago. It swirled thickly: Cally saw sand and twigs, fragments of seaweed, severed crabs’ legs. Those other, larger shapes, with their limp, dangling arms and legs, swirled in the water too.

That meant maybe seven hours, perhaps even fewer remaining. And before that, the air would grow stale as the purifiers ran out, fogging their brains and slowing them down.', 'Cally started towards Hanover—even now, she couldn’t think of her by any other name. They had to get away, find a way out. Her foot caught something on the floor, some sort of waterlogged rag. Then she recognised it as her cap. She wrung it out, water pattering on the deck.', 'Hanover snored on, oblivious, even though the blanket and her coverall were crumpled around her waist. Her black vest top and the bra underneath had been pushed up, exposing her small, firm breasts and taut belly.', 'No-one looked their best first thing in the morning, but Cally could think of far worse sights to wake up to every day. It would certainly be preferable to resuming her lonely, pointless vigil. It was long past time for her to find a life beyond Ben’s death.', 'Hanover shifted position, snoring. Cally had to chuckle—whatever else she had going for her, Hanover was next to useless with first aid. The bandage she’d tied last night had come loose. Perhaps it was because Hanover had fastened it in the dark. If she’d always been this useless at patching herself up she’d be dead by now.', 'A jagged cut ran along the underside of the forearm, from wrist to elbow. It was bloodless, without even a trace of scabbing; it might as well have been a slit in rubber. Worse, a flap of skin hung down like so much loose wallpaper. Hanover snored obliviously on. She should have been in agony, but she wasn’t.', 'She shifted in her sleep, turning sideways so that Cally was looking directly at the wound.', 'The underside of the skin flap was a faint, cyanotic blue. There was no blood. The exposed flesh—if it was flesh—was deep blue, glistening and translucent. Cally saw globules and sausage-shapes of what looked like blue gelatin, packed into the interior of Hanover’s arm, gently rippling and undulating.', 'Cally gave a short, strangled cry. Hanover grunted, blinked, and focused blearily on her, then grinned and rubbed her eyes. “Morning, gorgeous,” she said. Her smile, the wicked gleam in her eyes, were so natural that for a moment Cally smiled back. Then Hanover scratched her head, and she saw the wound a second time.', 'Hanover pulled her bra and vest top back down. “Best get a shift on. We’ve not far to go now. Depending on the state of what’s left of the old girl, we— Cally? What’s up, Doc?”', 'Hanover finally noticed the damage to her arm. “Ah,” she said. “Bollocks.”', 'In one fluid motion, Hanover stood, sliding from her coveralls like a snake shedding skin.

Her white feet, slender and beautiful—high arches, long toes—slid out of her boots and socks as if boneless.', 'The cap slipped from Cally’s hands, fell to the deck with a wet slap.', 'There was a moist squelching sound as Hanover pressed the skin flap back into place and pinched the wound’s edges together. It was matter-of-fact: another piece of maintenance. She looked up. Cally couldn’t decipher the look on her face. “Sorry, hun,” Hanover said, and white nictitating membranes darted across her eyes.', 'Hanover stepped forward, and Cally turned and ran.', 'The hands that had loved and pleasured Cally last night would now be inches from her neck. Cally yanked the nearest airlock hatch wide, leapt through, and slammed it in Hanover’s face.

Cally made for the next hatchway—but then it swung open, water spilling out across the deck, and the smell of the sea filled the station.', 'A bare foot emerged from the open hatchway to rest upon the deck. A white leg followed, and Hanover stepped out, in her vest top and shorts, gills pulsing in her neck, coal-black eyes flickering white. Cally dodged towards the next nearest remaining hatchway, but Hanover moved to cut her off. She stood, arms outspread. The look on her face was the same as before, and at last Cally recognised it as one of sorrow.', 'Cally found herself crying as she backed away. Was it fear, or something else? This had been the closest she’d come since Ben’s death to giving herself to another person.

But she did it anyway, and then ran on.', 'Her lungs burned; her legs ached. Cally staggered on, vision blurring. A lithe white shape flitted past the portholes. How was Hanover doing that? Inside one moment, outside the next. Was there more than one of her, was that it? Had Cally slept with one of a range of identical models, cranked out on an undersea production line?', 'She found another ceiling hatch, climbed up another vertical module and emerged into a horizontal module. A plaque on the wall—', '.', 'Each breath burned. Cally hunched over, coughing. She wasn’t sure how she stood or moved. She wheezed, and pain shot through her chest.', 'Behind her, a hatch clanged. Hanover walked slowly towards her', 'Cruelty, perhaps—that sad expression could have been as much a forgery as the rest of Hanover’s semblance of humanity. Or was she letting Cally exhaust herself, to do Hanover’s job for her?', 'Didn’t matter. None of it did. Part of Cally would have liked to give up, but she couldn’t. She actually wanted to live, she realised, not only to exist. ', '.', 'Was Hanover ', ' her? Was that it? Always in Cally’s path whenever she wanted to be. In the station before—she’d put herself between Cally and every exit except the one she’d used—one that, like every other turning she’d taken to evade Hanover, had brought her closer to T-8. Almost as if Hanover were helping her.', 'Cally entered yet another module; the airlock at the far end opened and Hanover stepped through. “Fuck off!” Cally screamed.', 'Was she really alone on ', '? Was everyone else dead or gone? It didn’t seem possible. But between the attack, the evacuation that would have followed, and the collapse, it could be—with or without Hanover and others like her to make certain of it. But Hanover could have killed Cally a dozen times, or simply let her die.', 'Above Cally was a hatch. She clambered up through it with what felt like the last of her strength. Shaking. Burning hot. Shivering. Every breath was a knife going in, was broken glass raking her lungs. Her arms and legs were sacks filled with rocks and lead. But the hatch above came closer; finally she pushed it open, dragged herself through and stood on trembling legs.', 'Burning with fever. Shaking with cold. A bulkhead plaque swam into focus:', 'Cally laughed weakly; it turned into another coughing fit. ', 'Cally heard the hatch to her left unlock. She turned and blundered away from it towards the opposite hatchway, hoping to God she was almost there. She had no more strength.', 'She collapsed into the airlock, then grabbed and turned the inner hatch’s wheel and pushed it wide. Her vision blurring, she looked back, to see Hanover’s bare feet slapping the steel deck as she ran towards her.', 'Cally fell through the hatchway, got to her feet as Hanover reached the airlock, threw her full weight against the hatch and slammed it shut. She twisted the wheel till it would turn no further. She found another crowbar on the wall and jammed it through the wheel.', 'Cally looked up, and saw there were EVAC hatches in the ceiling. A couple had red flags in them, but most of the pods were in place.', 'Cally began to laugh. It broke up and tailed away in a fresh coughing fit. She was nearly away (but even then, would Hanover pursue her?). All she had to do now was to climb to one of the evac pods. Should she grab another crowbar to defend herself? (And could she strike, even now, a killing blow at that face?) But her legs buckled beneath her and she grabbed an evac ladder for support. For a few seconds she hung from it, until her grip broke and she fell to the floor.', 'up', 'She couldn’t. She literally didn’t have the strength. She heard a wet squelching and trickling noise. Then it changed, became something firmer, more regular. A gentle padding sound, like bare feet on a steel floor.', 'Cally heaved herself onto her back, coughing.', 'Chief Petty Officer Jen Hanover stood in front of the closed airlock. “Hello, babe,” she said, and walked towards Cally.', 'Cally tried to wriggle away. Hanover knelt by her, a hand on her shoulder. “Shh,” she said. “Easy, Doc.”', 'Cally’s breath hitched. She was hyperventilating. A cool hand rested on her forehead. “You’re burning up,” said Hanover.', 'Shecouldn’t move now. ', '. All she could see were the black shark’s eyes, fixing her still. She fought for breath, and could only wheeze.', '“Cally?” said Hanover. “Love? What’s—” She put a hand to her throat, felt the gill-slits. “Shit. Sorry.”', 'The gill-slits closed. For a moment there were pale ridges, like scars, on Hanover’s neck; then they smoothed away into her skin. The nictitating membranes flickered. When they retracted, Hanover’s eyes were the ones Cally had yearned to look into last night. “Better?” Hanover asked.', 'Cally struggled in her grip. “Don’t, love,” Hanover said. “You’ll hurt yourself.”', 'Cally tried to speak, couldn’t. “Jesus,” she heard Hanover say. “You’re in a bad way. You’re not gonna make it…”', 'Her voice faded. Cally thought Hanover might have said, ', '… but could make out nothing else. Laid out across her knees, Cally saw the other woman peel the vest top off, then reach behind her back to unfasten her bra.', 'she tried to say, but only a mumble came out. Hanover laid the bra aside, small breasts taut from the cold, the dark nipples hard. “It’s okay,” she said, stroking Cally’s forehead. “C’mere, darling.”', 'She lifted Cally’s head to her breast, bringing her nipple to Cally’s mouth. ', ', thought Cally, ', '. But Hanover’s hands were as insistent as they were gentle, and soon Cally, despite herself, no longer wanted to resist.', 'She took the nipple in her mouth. It tasted of something Cally couldn’t place. A strange flavour, unfamiliar, but not unpleasant. Almost instinctively, Cally began to suckle.', 'The fluid that filled her mouth was smooth and creamy, but somehow salty, too. It tasted rich, savoury. Impossible, surely. Wouldn’t the brine sour the cream? And yet it was both delicious and warming—although it was streaming in impossible quantities from Hanover’s breast, faster than Cally could swallow it. ', ', she thought. But Hanover’s hands stroked her hair. If this was dying, it was easy and painless enough. Cally had no more strength to fight, so she closed her eyes and slept.', '\\xa0', 'Once more, Cally woke on a steel floor with Hanover. This time her companion was awake, with Cally’s head pillowed in her lap and caressing her brow. Cally realised it didn’t hurt to breathe any more. At most there was a faint tickle that might, given time, make her cough. But even that was fading.', '“Sleep well?” said Hanover. She’d put her vest top and bra back on, but if she felt the cold, she gave no sign. Her leg felt warm.', 'Memories resurfaced. ', 'they memories, and not dreams? It didn’t seem possible. Hanover seemed so normal, and if she was really a Bathyphylax, surely she’d have killed Cally by now.', 'Cally looked at Hanover’s forearm. The pursed lips of the wound were pinched together like clay, parted in places, bloodless.', '“Yeah,” Hanover said. She smiled, but the sad look lingered. “Sorry, babe. Still wondering if it was real, right? Well—it was.”', '“Oh, God.”', '“It’s okay.” Hanover stood and held out a hand. Cally took it automatically, then let go as soon as she was back on her feet. “Cally,” said Hanover, “I told you, it’s okay.”', '“Okay? Okay?” Cally shook with rage now, not cold. “You’ve smashed this place to hell, killed hundreds of people—thousands—”', '“Like your lot did in the Marianas Trench? Like you had been for years before—” Hanover broke off. “Look. I’m not here for that. And the attack wasn’t me either.”', '“You’re one of them.”', '“Depends how you mean.”', '“You’re a Toad.” Before, she’d used the term—if only to herself—unconsciously, in fear and anger; now Cally used it deliberately, wanting to hurt, but Hanover’s face remained placid.', '“Ah,” she said. “Now ', ', I can’t tell you.”', '“What?”', '“What do you ', ' know about the Toads, Cally—as you call them?”', '“I usually prefer to say Bathyphylax,” Cally muttered.', '“I know, love. But whatever you call us, what do you know? We live in the sea, use organic technology… and that’s it, the sum total of your knowledge. You don’t even know what we call ourselves. You ', 'don’t know a thing about our biology, and that’s how it’s going to stay. Maybe I’m an actual Bathyphylax in disguise, or maybe I’m something they made. I’ll never tell. I’ll only saying ‘we’ because it’s simpler. Main thing is, I’m with them. Personally, I’d rather we didn’t have to ', ' sides in all this.”', 'Years trying to communicate with the Bathyphylax, and here Cally was, speechless when she finally made contact with one. Although admittedly, she’d never expected it to play out quite like this.', 'Hanover snorted with laughter. She sounded so human Cally almost forgot she wasn’t. “You’ve got to admit, it’s funny. We’ve been around longer than you have, and you never even knew we were there. Never would have, if you could have stopped fucking up the ocean. Meanwhile, we know your lot ', ' well.” She struck a pose. “As you can see.”', '“Fooled me, anyway,” said Cally.', '“Sorry. Wasn’t the plan. Well, fooling you was—your species, I mean. Fooling ', ' with you, though—no.” Hanover grinned. “But it ', ' fun.”', '“You bitch—”', '“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to be cruel. It just—happened.”', '“You expect me to believe—”', 'Hanover shrugged. “It’s true. Anyway, come on.”', 'Cally shrank back. “Where?”', '“To one of these bloody pods, of course.” Hanover climbed a ladder and unlocked a hatch. “I can see why you wouldn’t believe me. Not like you’d be attracted to a crab or a squid.” She paused. “Actually, that’s not necessarily true with your species, is it? I mean, really—hentai? What the fuck’s ', ' about?” She dropped back to the deck and motioned towards the hatch. “Allez-oop, Doc.”', 'Cally inched towards the ladder. “Why?”', '“Call it going native, chica. Like I said, I’d seen you a few times. Admired you from a distance, you could say. And I don’t mean only in a physical sense, just so we’re clear. I ain’t that kind of girl.”', '“I didn’t mean that.” Cally felt dizzy. Were the purifiers running out of power? Maybe she was hallucinating this whole exchange in the throes of oxygen deprivation.', '“You mean this?” Hanover nodded to the ceiling. “Time’s nearly up, Doc. Only an hour or two of air left. And the old place is creaking like hell, so there’s probably another collapse on the way.”', '“No!” Cally almost stamped her foot. “I mean, why are you helping me? Why—” She broke off, put a hand to her lips. Hanover’s nipple in her mouth, that taste of cream and salt. “What did you do to me?”', '“What do you think? I didn’t want you to croak waiting for help, so sue me. You had full-blown pneumonia, chica. And it’s fucking chaos up there.”', '“Thanks to you and your friends. You healed me?”', '“No. You miraculously got better on your own. ', '.”', '“You could have infected me—some sort of bio-weapon.” Cally couldn’t get into the evac pod, could she? Mustn’t. God knew what she’d carry back with her.', '“I could have got you pregnant, but I didn’t. You really ', ' have a suspicious mind, don’t you?”', '“Why else would you save my life?”', '“Because you’re ', ', you silly cow. Doctor Cally McDonald. You built the first pumphouses, and you’ve made your whole life about trying to make contact with us, even after—” Hanover broke off.', '“Even after Ben,” said Cally. “Right?”', '“Yeah.”', 'Hanover was right, of course—this was the moment Cally had given up hoping for. The whole point had been not to give way to vengeance or hatred—but now, face to face with the Bathyphylax’s avatar, she felt closer to both than ever before. And yet there’d been that grip on her arm, lifting her to safety, the arms that had held her, the hands and lips that had loved her. An uncomplicated response to Hanover was impossible.', '“You devised the Contact Programme,” Hanover said. “You wanted to talk. So—here we are.”', 'Hanover held out her right hand. A swelling bulged in her palm, the skin stretched over it. It split—bloodlessly, of course, like every other opening in Hanover’s flesh—and something slid out. The cut resealed itself, and Hanover proffered the object to Cally. “Here you go, Doc. Get that to your most cunning linguists.”', 'It looked like a large mussel, but the shell shone silver. “What is it?”', 'Hanover pinched the hinge of the shell, and it opened. The creature inside resembled a tiny octopus, but completely covered in a segmented shell. It clicked and tapped its armoured tentacles against the shell’s interior, and let out a series of whistles and cheeps. Hanover closed the shell. “Recording tech, Toad style. Contains the equivalent of all the info you’ve been sending us. It’ll survive at least a year, longer if you feed it. It likes mackerel.”', 'Cally took the shell and put it in her pocket. “If you wanted to talk peace, why all this?”', '“You island-monkeys aren’t all the same, are you? Us neither. Some think there’s no talking to you and we either wipe you out or get poisoned to death. Others disagree. This…” She mimicked Cally’s gesture around the groaning structure, “was a long time coming. But it was agreed we’d put someone on board to try and get you out. I’d meant to be nearer the bridge when it all kicked off, but…”', 'Cally remembered the bridge: Harkness cut in two, Sugulle drowned, Baker pulped against the airlock hatch. “They all died.”', '“It’s a war, babe, remember? Point is to try and end it. I’ve done my bit.” Hanover put her hands on her hips. ', ', Cally thought. Was it really all a coincidence, or was Hanover’s appearance actually modelled on Cally’s ex? If so, how had they found out? How many others like Hanover might there be? Cally refused to follow that line of thought any further. She couldn’t deal with it, not now. Besides, she had a purpose. A new one. One mission had ended, and another begun. One far away from ', '.', '“Now get up that ladder,” Hanover said, “before I kick your pretty arse up it.”', 'Cally managed a smile. “Okay.”', '“Before I forget.” Hanover pulled something from her waistband. “Needs drying out, but it should be okay.”', 'Cally unfolded the cap. “Thank you.”', '“It suits you.” Hanover touched Cally’s cheek, then stepped away. Metal groaned and screeched nearby. “Better hurry, chica.”', 'Cally climbed up into the evac pod. “I’m sorry about ', ',” Hanover called after her.', 'Cally nodded. Something else that she wouldn’t even attempt to process until later. Much later.', 'She shut the hatch. Below, water was pouring into the module, pooling around Hanover’s feet. ', ', Hanover mouthed. Cally nodded, strapped herself into the seat nearest the pod’s control lever, then looked back down. Hanover was now up to her waist in the rising water. As it rose to the other woman’s chest, Cally pulled the lever. A hiss of air, a dull thump as the pod disengaged, and she was flying upwards.', 'Cally’s ears popped. Gas hissed gently: equalising the pressure to avoid barotrauma. The sun coming in through the portholes brightened as the pod ascended.', 'There was movement outside the porthole: Hanover, floating beside the pod as it rose. She touched her fingers to her lips, then to the glass, and was gone.', 'Something—too fast for Cally to make it out—flashed away through the water. Outside the porthole, a black vest and a pair of shorts hung briefly, in a cloud of fish scales, with a rag of seaweed and a thin skein of blue gelatin, before tumbling away, lost to the deep as Cally rose towards the light.', '\\xa0', 'The wave-strikes had wreaked havoc on shipping and swept more than a hundred people out to sea, which was why a search and rescue chopper was over the North Sea when the pod’s distress signal began sending. Hope had been more or less abandoned of finding any survivors from HMS', ' other than the few who’d escaped the initial assault, but the helicopter was no more than twenty miles from Cally’s position and the pilot altered course to investigate.', 'So, less than thirty minutes after jettisoning, Cally was winched aboard, a blanket draped around her shoulders and a mug of hot soup pressed into her hands.', 'Below her, the evac pod receded, bobbing in the sea, as the helicopter began its return to base. Would the pod reach land? As with so much else, that was uncertain; hidden, like the wreckage of ', 'Like ', ', buried under waves the colour of slate and lead.', 'As they reached the coast, Cally saw more cliffs had collapsed into the sea. Vast chunks had been bitten out of the restricted area. She couldn’t tell if the field containing her caravan had fallen. She looked away; she didn’t want to know, not yet. Could she bear losing another connection to Ben? Actually, she realised, she probably could, if she must. She’d borne far worse.', 'She straightened the cap on her head. It might be the last thing of his she had. If you could survive the calamity, you could crawl from the wreckage. Or hide in it, if you preferred, but she’d done enough of that.', 'Inland, the flooding was even worse. Neither Cally nor anyone else would drink in the Mariner’s Rest again: only one white wall and a chimney remained of it. Treetops, church spires and chimney pots poked out of brown water. A cow bobbed, belly bloated, legs jutting stiffly up. Human bodies floated there too. This would be remembered, and the desire for retaliation in kind deepen.', 'She squeezed the shell in her jeans pocket. Perhaps it was too little, too late, and the only future was a war without end. Against all reason and evidence, she had to hope otherwise. Cally clasped the shell tighter as she flew towards landfall, and savoured that remembered taste of milk and brine.', '\\xa0', 'Copyright © 2018 by Simon Bestwick', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Goñi Montes']}\n"

Everything is not all right, of course. His small shoulders are hunched, his chin tucked to chest, his eyes glassed over with shock, fear, exhaustion. Scipio’s knitted sweater all but swallows the boy’s skinny frame, but underneath it there are scars, rawpink and shiny, from what they did to him in the lab. Dry blood is flecked across his forehead from what Scipio did to them in return.', 'In the black mirror of the doors, Scipio sees his own reflection has fared little better. He looks like a monster, like the ', 'of his mother’s stories. His sunken eyes are dark hollows and his black body glove is still spattered in gore.', '“You’re home now,” he says. “Don’t be afraid.” He squeezes Mateo’s hand, but not tightly. The boy’s bones feel fragile as a bird’s.', 'The obsidian doors scrape open and El Tirano’s men spill out. Young bloods pumped full of testosterone and combat chemicals, bristling with blades and bioguns, faces painted to look like skulls. Scipio was one of them, once, but never exactly like them. Their eyes widen as they usher him and Mateo inside.', '“', '” one says. “We thought you weren’t coming back, ', '. There was no contact, we thought that…”', 'The doors clunk shut behind them, and El Tirano’s lieutenant, a man called Sol, finally holsters his gun. “Where are the others?” he demands. “You took seven of my men. Where are they now?”', '“Dead,” Scipio says. “But Mateo is alive.”', 'Sol’s face twists with pain for a moment. He looks down at Mateo. “', ',” he says numbly. He crosses himself and the gesture carries, contagious. One man presses his lips to the Santa Muerte tattoo on his arm.', 'Scipio knows that later Sol will go to the tattoo room himself, sit under the needle-armed plastic squid and ask it for seven markings up his left side, no analgesics. Sol is a good lieutenant in many ways.', 'El Tirano’s newly appointed head physician arrives, case swinging from his hand, a stretcher scuttling after him. Mateo flinches at the sight and Scipio seizes on it.', '“Later,” he says. “His father will want to see him.”', 'The physician hesitates, running a nervous tongue along chapped lips. “Is he injured at all? Are you?”', '“', ',” Scipio says. “', '”', '“', ',” Mateo says, his voice flaked away to a whisper.', 'The physician looks unconvinced. Scipio chases purple blots in the corner of his vision. Realizes he is swaying on his feet. For too long he’s been fueled by nothing but amphetamines and adrenaline. Now his nerves are rubbed raw and his legs feel like they have been dipped in lead.', 'But he’s come this far already. He swore that he would deliver El Tirano’s son back to him. He will finish this job, as he finished all the others.', 'Scipio scoops Mateo into his arms, turning away from the physician. Few others would dare to touch El Tirano’s son in such a way, but Scipio has served Mateo’s father for decades, and when Mateo loops his skinny arms around his neck it’s the same way he did as a toddler. Scipio can feel the boy’s staccato heartbeat as he carries him through the corridors.', 'He knows his way to the bone room by rote, but the walk seems unreal this time, something from a dream. He moves slower and slower. Partly the fault of the body: lactic acid seething in his muscles, bone-deep aches in his limbs. Partly the fault of the mind, of the familiar shadows reminding him that Mateo was the only bright thing ever born in this place.', 'For another fleeting moment he imagines carrying the boy away. Taking him somewhere where he will be safe from his father’s enemies and also safe from his father. But Scipio knows no such place exists.', 'Sol and his men escort them through the vaulted entryway of the bone room. Time seems to slow, crawling now on hands and knees. The hall’s high ceiling was chewed away by an army of buildbots and replaced with plastiglass meant to let in the sunlight, but there is so little of it these days. Scipio sees only dark sky swirling overhead.', 'Below it, El Tirano’s throne spans most of the room. It is a skeleton, transported from the bombed-out husk of some building in Coahuila and reassembled here piece by piece. Its', 'enormous skull rests on the floor, festooned with flowers and paint, grinning with serrated teeth the size of machetes. Its spiny tail juts into the air, propped up by carbon struts. Pale corpses dangle from the length, some mutilated, others whole, all of them coated in a bacterial film to hold back their stench.', 'El Tirano sits in the center of the beast, where two ribs have been replaced by a black chair bolted to the spinal column and draped with bright red spidersilk. El Tirano is not a giant, as they say in the stories. He is a head shorter than Scipio, small-boned, wiry. An ancient neural implant clings to the back of his shaved skull like a spider—only his physicians understand how it works, how it converts El Tirano’s thoughts into electricity and stores them. His body is veined with cobalt tattoos and his modified eyes gleam like a cat’s when he sees his son.', 'Once El Tirano controlled the drug trade. Now that the government is gone, now that half the country has been laid to waste by natural disaster and orbital bombardment, he controls everything.', 'He makes a sound in his throat, and the bone room falls into perfect silence.

Scipio’s eyes go to one girl in particular.', 'There is the stumbling ', ', robes stretched across a swollen belly, his skin doughy red and webbed with smashed capillaries. He railed once too often against El Tirano’s sins of indulgence, so El Tirano had him implanted with saccharomyces that make his stomach produce ethanol all on its own like a brewery. Scipio knows his liver will fail soon, and El Tirano has no plans to replace it.', 'There is El Tirano’s accountant, standing by the skeleton’s haunch, thin and somber and dressed all in black. The brim of his top-hat hides his eyes and he holds an antique screen and stylus in his pale hands. People say he was born on Cuba, one of those islands that sank beneath the sea so many years ago.

His fingers trail against Mateo’s bony shoulder, not quite willing to let go. Mateo looks up at him and murmurs a thanks. Then he’s gone, moving up the red pathway to his father, staggering, half-running. El Tirano sinks to his knees to welcome him, tears tracking down his dark face.', 'Scipio looks over their heads, back to the painted girls arrayed around the beast’s clawed feet. Most are watching the reunion, some still dancing on automatic, tracing sine curves in the air. One is watching Scipio, eyes narrowed as if she knows.', 'In a way, Nazaret is the reason for everything that has happened and is about to happen now.', '\\xa0', 'Scipio has brought El Tirano a traitor’s head on ice in a battered orange cooler, so El Tirano has given him a courtesan in exchange. She is slouched by the door, picking at her artery-red nails, when he returns to his rooms.', '“I think I was supposed to be waiting on the bed,” she says. “But nobody has an override for this lock. I suppose his little screen didn’t tell him that.”', 'Scipio looks at her. She might be a new girl; it’s difficult to tell. Their faces are all painted alike and they all dress in reds and blacks but mostly bare skin. This one has her dark hair piled up off her neck and secured with a glinting metal pin. Her paint-stitched lips have a contemptuous twist to them. Scipio wonders why El Tirano thought he would want her when he has never wanted any of the others. El Tirano knows he has no appetite for it.', '“I like privacy,” Scipio says.', '“', 'the courtesan says. “Or you wouldn’t stay all the way down here. I nearly got lost.”', 'Scipio puts his hand inside the genelock; it rasps like a cat’s tongue against his skin and chimes confirmation. Next he knuckles a short code into the keypad. The lock comes undone, click-clunk, and he pushes the door open.', 'He’s tired. His target was nearly to the ruins of the old border wall before he caught up to him, and Scipio dragged the fat man’s body through muddy marsh for two hours, through a cloud of carrion beetles drawn to the flesh smell, before he gave up, sat down, and sawed off just the head.', 'He wants nothing more than to send the girl away so he can rest. El Tirano must know this, too. Maybe this is one of his little jokes, like the one he played on the ', ', or maybe there is some other reason for her to be here.', '“Come in, but don’t speak,” Scipio says. “Please.”', 'The courtesan purses her mouth and mimes a sewing needle in the air. Her shoes click against the floor, making echoes as she follows him inside. Scipio shuts the door, points her toward a chair, and goes to wash.', 'There’s a fresh gas tank screwed into place and the water heats up quickly. He peels off his clothes and steps under the jet, letting it carve the congealed mud off his body. Dirty water rushes across the tiles to the drain. One of his toenails is coming off again, battered purple-blue, and he finds bruises blooming on his shin and his chest.', 'When he comes out, the courtesan is naked from the waist-up and kneeling on the bed. “', '” she asks in her throat.', '“', ',” Scipio says. He goes to his cabinet and undoes another genelock. “Do you want anything?” he asks, pulling out a syringe and a small sealed jar.', '“Whatever you want me to have,” she says. “Careful if you use a tranquilizer, though. I might shit.” She says it with a bland smile on her face, but Scipio’s stomach revolts at the image of her lying boneless on the bed, unable to move.', '“I don’t keep tranquilizer.” He pauses. Something in her way of speaking prickles at his memory. “What’s your name?”', '“Nazaret,” she says. “And you are El Cuervo, who can kill anybody.”', '“You should be more scared of me, then,” Scipio says. He fills the syringe, slaps his arm to bring out the vein. The needle goes in like a whisper and warmth floods his body. All his aches dissolve.', '“I should be,” she agrees. “I have a condition. I can’t be very scared or very angry or very anxious about anything. The physician says there’s a faulty loop in my brain. I can act scared, if you want.”', '“Why would I want that?” Scipio asks.', '“People want all sorts of things,” the courtesan says. “You, I don’t know. You don’t want girls, you don’t want boys. Someone said your ', ' were ripped off by a dog when you were a child, but I can see that’s not true.” She smirks at him. “Maybe you only want corpses.”', 'Scipio has heard that rumor before. It circulates through the court every so often. The truth is that he hates corpses: in his sleep he sees hundreds of them, and they bury him alive.', '“And you want to shit on my bed,” Scipio says.', '“', '” she says scowling, and Scipio has heard enough.', '“You hide your accent,” he says. “You’re from one of the northern villages.” He hesitates, hardly daring to believe it. “Parera, I think.”', 'Her eyes widen slightly in their coal-black pools. She nods.', 'Scipio has been with El Tirano so long that he nearly forgot his village was real. Now it all comes to him in a rush: the steep wedged paths up the mountain, the peeling yellow bridge, the ', ' with its many plague crosses, the tiny houses roofed with tin and the packed-dirt streets roamed by scrawny black dogs. He sinks to the bed. The drug and the memories mingle, swimming his veins, loosening his tongue.', '“Do you know Calle Gongora?” he asks. “When I was a child, I lived on Calle Gongora. In the ', ' over the welding shop.”', '“', ',” she says, her painted lips sliding back off her teeth. “I lived on Bombona. We would have been almost neighbors.”', 'Now Scipio remembers the dusty square, fighting for a ball of bundled plastic in the games of barefooted football where he was always the quickest and the strongest. He remembers the crumbling stone stable, overgrown by creeping vines, where they could play if they were wary of snakes. He remembers the procession of plastic statues during Semana Santa, the chanting and wailing and guitars.', 'He even remembers the mother who carried him on her hip when he was small, who told him stories at night until a final outbreak of plague made her too sick to talk. When the plague took her away from him, his uncle took him away from Parera.', '“Do the vines still bloom?” Scipio asks. “There is so little rain these days.”', 'The courtesan’s face shifts behind her mask of makeup. “Nothing blooms,” she says. “Parera is gone, or I wouldn’t be here.”', 'Scipio’s throat constricts. “The plague,” he says, thinking of all the crosses.', 'She shakes her head. “The tax,” she says. “Parera would not pay El Tirano’s tax, so his soldiers came in the early morning with machetes. They cut up the men. I saw one right outside my door when I woke up, slit like a pig, his ', ' still steaming.” She stares at him. “After, they doused the houses in gasoline. Parera burned.”', 'Scipio says nothing. He shuts his eyes and sees the creeping vines around the old stone stable twisting and blackening. He sees the ', 'on Calle Gongora collapsing in on itself, swallowed in flames. Does El Tirano think this is a gift, giving him a memento of a village now burned to the ground? Or is it pure chance? Scipio never told him that his crow first flew from Parera.', 'He goes back to the cabinet and retrieves a tequila bottle, rubbing the dust from the cap with his thumb. He pours two glasses.', '“To Parera,” he says. “Drink with me.” He gives a precise twist of his wrist and a single drop falls from the bottle onto the floor. Then he hands the courtesan her glass.', '“Parera,” she echoes, but her eyes seem accusing. They drink and it burns all the way down Scipio’s throat. His own eyes smart with tears. He pours again, quickly, and slops some over the side. They drink again, and once more. It settles dense and hot in his stomach but his chest feels scooped out, empty.', '“How long ago?” he asks.', '“Two years,” she says.', '“I didn’t know,” Scipio says. “I would have…” He trails off.', '“You would have done nothing,” she says. “', ' Parera would have burned anyway. A puppeteer does not take the advice of his puppets. Not even his favorite puppet.” She makes her hand dance along the bed like a marionette. “And eventually, everything burns.”', 'They lie down on the bed. She squeezes his cock in her hand, moves her thumb in a questioning circle around the head. He shuts his eyes, and when he opens them she’s scooted backward, taking him in her mouth, cheeks hollow and eyes glazed. She looks like a skeleton devouring him. He shakes his head.', '“Nothing?” she says, picking a hair off her tongue.', '“Tell me what you remember about Calle Bombona,” he says.', 'She tells him about the neighbor who had an orange tree she used to steal from, about the afternoon stink when someone wasn’t watching their feet and stepped in a dog’s shit.', 'He tells her what he remembers about the stone stable and the vines, as if by telling her he can forget it, and she says it’s strange to think he was a child, once, that he didn’t descend from some dark cloud.', 'When the drink and the drug and memories have made him feel bloated, tender, he asks her what she looks like without the ', ' makeup. She disappears, reappears dripping; he touches rippled scar tissue on her neck and her chin from where a burning splinter of wood flew and struck her. Her eyes are brighter without the black paint swallowing them. Her lips are unbound.', 'She snakes an arm around his chest and holds him like that. She murmurs into his ear until he falls asleep. In the morning she is gone, and he is El Cuervo again.', '\\xa0', 'Scipio drags his eyes away from Nazaret’s painted face.', 'Mateo is only steps from his father’s embrace. Were Scipio to lunge now, he could stop him. He could take him back into his arms and run the other way. But he has no strength left in his legs, and El Tirano’s swarming soldiers would bring him down in an instant.', 'Instead he looks at the ', ', who wraps his arms around the leg of the throne for balance, his bleary eyes trained on the unfolding scene. Scipio knows that the ', 'has the same neat surgical sutures under his heavy black vestment that Mateo has under his shirt.', 'In that way, the two are connected. In that way, what happens next will be because of the ', '.', '\\xa0', 'When Scipio leaves the armory, winding fresh geckowrap around the handle of his knife, he finds the ', 'lying in the corridor. Beached, like one of the whales that swam up from the toxic sea to die on Yucatan’s phosphate-soaked sand so many years ago. The ethanol stench hangs over him like a cloud.', '“', '” Scipio asks.', 'The man gives a gurgling laugh. “We are all lost,” he says. “We are all lost souls here.” He heaves himself upright, clutching at his swollen belly. When he recognizes Scipio, he barely flinches. Once he would have gone pale with fright. But the brewery in his gut has reddened his skin and dulled his nerves. “Is this where the crow sharpens his beak?” he slurs, pointing to the knife.', 'It was blunted by sawing through vertebrae, but now, as the ', ' observes, the blade is bright and keen again. Scipio stows it in his sleeve sheath. He has never liked priests much.', '“I’ll send for the physician,” he says. “You look ill.”', 'The ', 'chokes on another laugh. “', 'No, no. Keep that devil away from me. He’s done enough damage.” He holds his gut again, running fingers along where the surgeons implanted him. “I forgive him, of course. He did only the bidding of his master. Same as you and I. A loyal servant of El Tirano.”', '“', '.” Scipio steps over the man’s splayed legs and heads down the corridor, toward the bone room and his station in the beast’s shadow.', '“I know why you are loyal, Scipio!”', 'The last word freezes him in place. Scipio turns back to see the ', 'clambering to his feet, palms flat to the wall for balance. Nobody but El Tirano knows the name Scipio, the name his mother in Parera gave him. He has been El Cuervo for years and years.', '“Our master told me why you are loyal. He confessed to me.” The ', 'takes a wheezing breath. “He thinks I can’t remember things, because of the yeasts. But that story, I remember.”', 'Scipio looks up and down the stone hallway. Empty. “So tell me,” he says.', 'The ', 'slips back down the wall with a thump. He grimaces, closes his eyes. “It was in Juarez,” he says. “There was a little boy. Staying with an addict who couldn’t pay his debts. Addicts, they can be so creative when desperation takes hold.”', 'Scipio feels the handle of the knife in his sleeve. The geckowrap ripples at his touch, ready to leap into his grip. He reminds himself that he can make the ', ' stop speaking whenever he wants. He tries to keep his heartbeat slow.', '“But eventually even that wasn’t enough,” the ', ' says. “So the debt collectors came and they tore off his fingers with pliers and then shot him in the head. El Tirano was not El Tirano then. He was just a foot soldier. Practically a boy himself.', '“It was Semana Santa, and none of them wanted a child’s blood on their hands on a holy day. But their boss had said to kill every living thing they found in the apartment. So El Tirano, he volunteered. He said, leave me the gun. I’ll do it.”', 'The memory lances through Scipio’s mind: the filthy apartment, the dark congealing puddle under his uncle’s body, the buzzing flies. His bony shoulders pushed back against the wall like he can disappear into it. El Tirano standing there watching him, holding a gun too big for his tattooed hands, his head tilted to one side.', '“But here you are,” the ', ' says, opening his eyes. “Here you are alive. Do you wonder why?”', '“Mercy,” Scipio says.', '“So he told you, so he told you,” the ', ' coughs. “But he pulled the trigger. Pulled it twice. The gun was jammed. He confessed that to me. The gun was jammed, and the apartment smelled awful, and he needed someone small to run a brick under wire-fence. So you are alive.”', 'Scipio springs the knife from his sleeve; the geckowrap suctions warm and pebbly to his callused fingers. He walks to the ', 'in two swift strides and yanks his head backward, baring his chubby throat.', '“I know he pulled the trigger,” Scipio says flatly. “I remember the clicking sound. But God works in mysterious ways, ', '.”', 'The ', ' shuts his eyes again, his breath wet and labored. His hair is greasy in Scipio’s fingers. The blade hovers at his throat. El Tirano will be displeased to lose his priest and clown, but Scipio does not want anyone else to hear this particular story. It opens him like a wound.', 'Footsteps in the corridor behind them. Scipio stows the shaking knife. He decides he will do it tonight, in the ', ' chambers, and make it look as though the man has choked to death on his own vomit.', '“', '”', 'Scipio turns to see one of Sol’s men, one whose face is a swirl of shifting tattoos. The whites of his eyes are bright within the blue pigment.', '“Mateo’s convoy was attacked outside the city,” he blurts. “He’s gone, and they took the', ', too. It was the Maras, it fucking has to be, those dog-fuckers, they took Mateo.”', 'From where he’s sprawled on the floor, the ', 'crosses himself. “Lost souls,” he murmurs. “All lost souls.”', 'Scipio gives him a vicious kick that makes him jackknife, groaning, then follows Sol’s man to the bone room.', '\\xa0', 'El Tirano hoists Mateo up into his arms, clinging so fiercely to him Scipio almost believes his love is real. He gives a wild laugh that echoes to the corners of the bone room and up into the dark sky. With Mateo cradled against him, he turns back to his throne. The neural implant bobs at the back of his head.', '“', ',” he says. “I am saved.” He presses his lips to his son’s blood-flecked forehead. For an instant Scipio sees a shiver go through Mateo’s entire body. The accountant must have seen it, too, because he flinches backward. With his head bent, only his mouth is visible beneath the brim of his black hat. Scipio sees he is chewing his lips raw.', 'The accountant knows what will happen next. More than Nazaret, more than the ', '. He was the one who selected the meteor.', '\\xa0', 'There are three of them left in the bone room. El Tirano, who has not slept since Mateo was taken, is pacing. The accountant stands to one side, his glowing tablet hooked to a generator by tangled wires, awaiting news from El Tirano’s many ears and eyes. Scipio sits at the foot of the skeleton, where there is a pocket of faint perfume in the air that smells like Nazaret.', 'He watches El Tirano go back and forth, back and forth beneath the beast’s spiky tail. A bottle of rum dangles from his hand, cocaine clings white to his nose hairs, and his eyes are all glowing pupil as he inspects the hanging corpses of his enemies.', '“Was it you, ', '?” he demands, stopping at one of the upside-down bodies. He seizes it by the chin and peers into its mutilated face, where the bacterial film is taut across gouged-out eye sockets. “Your sniveling nephews, out to avenge you? So they take my son? Is that it, Quini?”', 'He gives the corpse a contemptuous slap that sets it spinning like a children’s top. He goes to the next.', '“Javier, have your Southern dogs grown bold again?” El Tirano murmurs. “Tell me, Javier. You weakling. You ', '.” He runs his tongue along the body’s ruined cheekbone, then spits on the floor. “', ', he tastes like shit.”', '“He’s dead,” Scipio says flatly. He has no patience left for El Tirano’s theatrics. He is waiting, like a taut wire, for news of Mateo. Mateo, who once rode on his shoulders through the sunny garden. Mateo, who never flinches at the sight of him.', 'El Tirano takes a deep swig from his bottle and wipes his mouth. “Don’t you say that fucking word to me.”', '“I said nothing. It was the skeleton.”', 'El Tirano hurls the bottle away; it smashes somewhere in the dark as he darts to the other side of his throne, past the startled accountant.', '“You’re right,” he says. “Look. Look at how this fucking thing laughs at me.” He squats down, rapping his knuckles against the beast’s grinning teeth. “You know why he laughs? He was the king once. He was a great meat-eating bird, no wings, but savage as a shrike. Big as a tree. He was the king until a meteor deposed him.”', 'Scipio looks at the skull, wondering what could have bested its owner. “What is a meteor?”', '“A rock,” El Tirano says. “A big rock with an unlucky trajectory.” He puts his hand on top of the skull, gripping the ridge of bone over the eye socket. Then he fingers the neural implant at the back of his skull. “Now he laughs, because he thinks my meteor is coming. I need my son back. I need him to live.”', 'There is an electronic chime from the accountant’s tablet, a noise that has repeated every few minutes for the past several hours, but this time the accountant’s eyes snap upward.', '“They’re in Barrio Alto,” he says. His voice is faint and cracked and carries the accent Scipio is still unsure of. “An old plague house. Calle Guerra.”', 'El Tirano seizes the tablet to see for himself. His hands clench tight around it, then he looks up with his eyes gleaming silver. They were peeled for night vision by a back-alley surgeon when he was young, when he was a drug runner in Juarez, back before the government collapsed. Before he was El Tirano and before Scipio was anyone at all.', '“Take the men you need,” he says. “I don’t care how many. You are going to bring Mateo back to me.” He sticks the tablet back into his accountant’s hands and grips Scipio by the shoulders, leans in close to whisper. “Swear that to me, Scipio. Swear it on your dead.”', 'Scipio has too many dead to remember them all. He thinks of his village, razed to the ground, butchered bodies steaming in the morning air. But Mateo is not responsible for that. Not for any of it. Mateo is the one bright thing that was ever born in El Tirano’s shadow.', '“I swear,” Scipio says.', 'El Tirano squeezes his shoulders, releases him. “Go, go.” He turns toward the accountant. “Make the arrangements for him to be in the ', ' by dawn. No one can know.”', 'The accountant nods, eyes invisible beneath the black brim of his hat. Scipio feels a premonition tapping cold fingers up his spine. He says nothing as they leave the bone room, as El Tirano clambers back up into the beast, muttering to himself, but the instant they are through the arched entryway and its inbuilt scanners he wraps his hands around the accountant’s pale throat. His hat, knocked loose, flutters to the floor like a wounded bat.', '“I want to talk about numbers,” Scipio says. He pushes his thumbs into the accountant’s yielding skin. He can feel the pounding pulse. “El Tirano has thirty-three courtesans. Only one of them comes from Parera. But El Tirano, he thinks I was born in Juarez. Was it chance that Nazaret was sent to me? One in thirty-three? Or was it you?”', 'The accountant blinks his black eyes. “Me,” he whispers.', '“Was it chance the ', 'came to me in the armory?” Scipio asks.', 'The accountant shakes his head.', 'Scipio tightens his grip around the man’s throat. “Is it chance Mateo disappears, and now reappears where we were most sure to find him?”', '“There’s no trap,” the accountant hisses. “Mateo is alive. You leave now, you’ll find him alive. And when you find him, you’ll understand.”', 'Scipio lets him go; he reels against the wall, gasping. Scipio has more questions, many more, but if he learns the answers to them he knows he will have to kill the accountant, and things will continue as they are. Instead he asks only one.', '“How many villages like Parera?”', 'The accountant’s eyes flash up and left. “This year? Seven.”', '“Sol will be watching you,” Scipio says. “Don’t try to leave. When I come back with Mateo, we’ll speak again.”', 'The accountant snatches his hat from the floor and dusts it off against his leg, not looking Scipio in the eyes. He nods.', '\\xa0', 'El Tirano climbs carefully back up into the beast, setting Mateo on his lap. One of Sol’s men gives a ragged cheer and it catches, carries around the bone room. The skull-painted soldiers holler and stamp their feet. The accountant tucks his tablet under one arm and quietly applauds, while the ', 'slams his meaty hands together beside him.', '“God smiles,” he bellows. “God smiles on you, El Tirano!”', 'El Tirano holds up his fist for silence and the noise chokes off. He looks at Scipio now, and Scipio looks back. “You swore to bring Mateo back to me,” he says. “And ', ', you have. You flew through the night and you struck down my enemies and you brought him back. Tell me, my loyal crow. Tell me what you want, and you’ll have it.”', 'Scipio feels the eyes of the court on him now, like razors slicing and peeling him. He wants so many things. He wants the mother who held him on her hip. He wants to undo a thousand deeds, even ones he has not done yet. He wants for El Tirano’s gun not to have jammed. He wants to go back to Parera.', '“I want to be the meteor,” Scipio says.', 'El Tirano frowns. “What?”', '\\xa0', 'Dawn is streaking the sky with filaments of red when they arrive at the plague house. Scipio and seven of Sol’s men, all gloved in combat black, armed to the teeth, running clean and cold on amphetamine injections. Scipio leads them in single file along the side of the crumbling building, moving low and quick over broken glass and caked dust. The stench of death is gone now but the wall is still scrawled with typical plague graffiti: ', 'They breach the dented metal door with a shotgun, and Scipio deads the first two guards before they can raise arms, two bullets left cooling in shattered craniums. His revolver is silenced but it’s still enough noise to bring a third man running. Scipio ducks low, springs the knife from his sleeve, and as the guard turns the corner he slashes upward and opens the femoral artery. Blood hoses across the wall and floor in a wild arc; the guard wails, slips. One of Sol’s men finishes him with a round in the chest.', 'Scipio wipes his knife clean on the dead man’s pants, avoiding the spreading blot of shit from shock-emptied bowels. His heart is thrumming. The plague house has three floors and a basement; the door to the stairwell is jammed open.', '“Clear the floor,” he says. “Then work upward. Watch your triggers until Mateo is safe.” He picks a soldier at random. “You, with me. To the basement.”', 'The other men salute and disperse. As Scipio heads to the stairwell he feels like he is being drawn by a magnet. The accountant’s words loop through his head. He lopes down the concrete stairs, listening for the shuffle of feet, the chitinous click of weapons being readied. Sol’s man is breathing too loudly behind him.', 'The basement level is cold. The chilled air carries the scent of antiseptic and something that is not quite gasoline. Scipio hears a humming generator and the whine of fluorescent tubes. He shuts one eye before he opens the door.', 'Harsh white lights stark the scene. An operating table. Trays of glinting metal implements. IV bags hung from the ceiling. Small heaps of bloody gauze. A rippling curtain.', 'Scipio hears a scratching noise and swings to face it, but it’s only a black-and-yellow beetle skittering around inside a glass dish. Above it on the wall screen, its insectoid anatomy is laid out like blueprints, covered in notes.', 'The chemical stench is strong. Scipio moves slowly into the room and finally hears a panicked breath. He motions Sol’s man toward the metal lockers at the back of the room, where the toe of a shoe is just barely poking out from behind. Scipio himself goes to the curtain and peers through the gap.', 'Mateo is lying there on a cot, naked, not moving. For the first time in a long time, Scipio feels something black and bubbling in his gut. Fear.', 'For an instant, it is Scipio there on the cot, prone and shivering.', 'But the accountant told the truth: Mateo is still breathing. Scipio sees his skinny chest rising and falling. He pulls the curtain aside and walks closer, studying the shiny pink scar tissue on Mateo’s belly, a neat line of surgical sutures. He frowns.', '“It’s the ', ',” calls Sol’s man. “He’s alive.”', 'Scipio turns back. El Tirano’s personal physician, the one who oversaw the ', 'surgery, who so closely monitors his master’s health and Mateo’s as well. He is a tall man but now he stoops; his eyes are bagged and his shock of gray hair is matted with sweat. Scipio looks at the physician’s clever hands, liver-spotted old but still strong and steady.', '“What did you do to him?” Scipio asks.', 'The physician’s face crumples. “They made me,” he says. “El Cuervo, I swear. They put a gun to my head.”', '“You put something inside him,” Scipio says, as the fear in his gut transmutes into rage. “You cut him open and implanted him with something. Now take it out.”', '“I can’t,” the physician says dully. “It’s a miracle he survived the first operation. If I try to take it out, I’ll kill him.”', '“What is it?”', 'The physician grimaces. “A weapon. Genelocked. You know genelocks, yes? It will only go off when it encounters a perfect match. So, only for one man. Biological components only. The scanners won’t find it.”', 'Scipio looks over at the skittering bombardier beetle, the dissection blown up on the wall. He inhales the smell that is not quite gasoline.', '“It will at least be quick,” the physician says. “Better than what El Tirano has planned for him.”', '“Mateo will not be like El Tirano,” Scipio says. “He has no cruelty in him.”', 'The physician croaks a laugh. “Mateo will be exactly like El Tirano. He will be El Tirano. That’s the secret.” He puts his hand at the back of his head and mimes the shape of El Tirano’s neural implant. “In five, six years, when El Tirano’s heart finally gives out, the implant will go onto Mateo’s skull instead. Like the wealthy men before the plague, El Tirano will be immortal. He will use Mateo’s young body as his own, like a puppeteer uses a puppet, and Mateo will be a prisoner in his own flesh.”', '“You’re lying.”', 'But Scipio remembers the bone room, El Tirano’s agitated fingers touching the shining implant. ', ' he said. ', 'And so Mateo is only a vessel to him. A tool. The way Scipio was a tool to his uncle in filthy Juarez and has been a tool to El Tirano for all the years since. Rage is boiling under Scipio’s skin, making his hands shake. Rage at the physician, for telling him this, for condemning Mateo to death. Rage at the accountant for planning it, and at El Tirano for planning something even worse.', 'What Scipio thought was El Tirano’s love for Mateo was only love for himself.', '“If I take him away?” Scipio asks. “Take him far from his father?”', 'The physician shakes his head. “When the components dissolve, it will poison him. In a week, in a month. It will kill him.”', '“When will he wake up?” Scipio asks, his finger drifting to the trigger of his gun.', '“The sedative should wear off within an hour,” the physician says. “What happens after that will be your—”', 'Scipio’s bullet punches through the bridge of his nose and leaves a greasy red-and-gray splatter on the locker behind him. Sol’s man blinks, steps back. Scipio shoots him, too.', 'He goes to the cot and covers Mateo’s scrawny body with a blanket. Maybe he should have forced the physician to try, at gunpoint, to take the weapon out. Maybe he should have tortured him.', 'Maybe he should smother Mateo in his sleep now. Would that be more merciful?', 'Scipio loads a fresh clip into his handgun and checks the blade of his knife. An hour is long enough for him to kill the others and hide their bodies where Mateo won’t see them on the way out. Mateo will feel safe when he dies. Maybe he will even feel happy. And Scipio will answer to one less puppeteer.', 'He kisses his fingers and touches them to the boy’s clammy forehead, leaving tiny smears of blood behind.', '\\xa0', 'The fireball unfurls from Mateo’s body and consumes him and his father in an instant; a clap of superheated air washes across the whole room.', 'Screaming. The courtesans are scrambling away, dragging each other to safety. The ', 'robes have caught fire and he rolls but the ethanol in his sweat has made him into living tinder. Scipio looks for the accountant, but the small, black-clad man has vanished. Scipio looks for Nazaret, who told him everything burns eventually, but in the chaos he can’t extract her painted face from the others.', 'The fireball expands, swallowing the throne, making the spidersilk blacken and shrivel. People are running all around him, some of Sol’s soldiers fleeing, others hurling buckets of water at the blaze. Scipio stands there and lets the heat ripple across his face, watching the beast’s great ribs crack and collapse how the rafters of his childhood home must have cracked and collapsed.', 'Flames lick up and down the length of the skeleton, turning the flowers to gray ash in an instant, charring the bone and making the metal bolts groan and sway. The corpses dangling from its tail alight one by one, their bacterial coats swelling and popping like maggots. At last the joints collapse and the skeleton crashes to the floor, its bones sliding, snapping.', 'Scipio stands, watching it crumble and blacken until only the skull is left intact, empty-eyed, grinning into the void. Then he makes his way out of the bone room, sliding through the panicked crowd like a shade.', 'He will travel to Parera and clean his hands in its ashes, and then he will return to see what sort of throne the accountant has built for himself. And if it is not to his liking, he will destroy that one, too.', 'He was El Cuervo, who could kill anybody, and now he is the meteor.', '\\xa0', 'Copyright © 2018 by Rich Larson', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Jeffrey Alan Love']}\n"

They splinter their own minds in order to manipulate metal at the microscopic level, creating shadow selves to craft the nano-architecture of metal alloys into perfection. Near the vast steelworks of Karshad, a journalist has fallen in love with the residual personality of a metallurgist, but what will happen when realliance—and forgetting—comes?', 'Translated by Julie Novakova.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'In Karshad, everything was somehow strange, unseemly: the ceramic foam heat barriers resembling medieval city walls, hearths of the forges and blast furnaces glowing into the dark like blood-red headlights turned to the skies shrouded in smog. And Bamobah standing beside me in her silvery jumpsuit. Still beautiful, yes, but beautiful in her distant, desert way, so contrasting with the immediate reality of the filth and cough of the steelworks. The barriers surrounding us were overwritten with Middle-Eastern scripts I had never seen before. But seeing the symbol of three forebodingly intertwined dislocation lines above each of them, I knew what they meant. ', ': The Cloud of Metallurgists.', '“Don’t stare, just come.” Bamobah reached her hand out to me, but stopped an inch from mine. “That doesn’t concern us.”', '“I know.”', 'The path was trodden in dust and slag. Somewhere the outlines of stairs, worn smooth, could be glimpsed. Everything was wrong. Settling in Bamobah’s wavy black hair should not be ash, but sand. Reflecting from her dark-brown eyes should not be the glow of searing metal, but beams of the sun setting over a desert.', 'I shook my head and walked on. We were in Karshad already for four days, but the places we had seen blurred into one in my mind. Waiting rooms, walkways, elevators, off-white floors dirty with dust and ash from the soles of our boots. I waited, while Bamobah lay down on the diagnostic tables, waited, while she was answering psychoanalysts’ questions. And when my waiting was finally over, when she emerged from the padded door in late evening, even paler than before, she only gave me an empty, indecipherable gaze.', '“How is it? Everything all right?” I asked.', 'She nodded briefly. “Yes, of course.”', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'When we lived in Piraka, in a tiny flat rented by my editorial office for me, we slept in my uncomfortable creaking bed. Beneath one blanket, in a pleasant contortion of limbs.', 'Here in Karshad, the steelworks provided a luxury hotel room for us. A room with two single beds. We were filling in heaps of forms Bamobah had brought from her medical examination, in silence. Then we just wished each other good night and switched off the light. The charm of the desert was lost in the silent hum of air conditioning.', 'Far west, where the sea of sand met the real sea, Piraka was also fast asleep. I imagined its congress center, all soundless in the middle of the night. I had met Bamobah there. I recalled her sitting on a soft chair and absently listening to someone’s speech. Her gaze traveled to me for a moment.', '“Before I give you my answer,” she said when I finally dared to talk to her and invite her to dinner, “you must know something about me.”', 'I was prepared for everything, apart from what she said next: “I’m a metallurgist. I mean right now.”', 'Bamobah would have understood if I told her a polite goodbye at that moment. If I stopped looking into her eyes and disappeared at the first opportunity.', 'But instead, I imagined her walking, tall and proud, through the heart of a sizzling ingot, caressing the ribbons of Laves phase with her slender fingers, and her wavy hair overflowing with loops of Frank-Read sources. And I found it enchanting. Alluring. Stirring.', '“Which steelworks?”', '“Karshad. I’m coming back in six months.”', '“Six months is a long enough time,” I said and walked with her to the car.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The Bamobah I had come to know had a simple, modest lifestyle. That, of course, didn’t say anything about her real income, only the allowance she was receiving during each shift. Before she moved in with me, she had lived in an unobtrusive, but certainly not cheap hotel.', 'Once, when we were leaving the town for the weekend and passed by the small islands of luxury residential quarters scattered over the hills by the northern edge of Piraka, Bamobah pointed down to the shore. “There’s my house.”', 'I looked and saw the white shining roof of a large villa surrounded by a tall hedgerow. “What is it like there?”', 'She shrugged. “I don’t know. Spacious. Modern. I like it and feel good there, I suppose.”', 'It was fascinating and confusing how Bamobah could speak about both of her personalities in first person in one sentence: her primary consciousness working in the ingot’s microstructure, and the residual consciousness remaining in her human body.', 'To understand it, I had to first fully understand who’s sitting beside me. Her face, her eyes, her voice, her smile – all of that was just an empty shell and its mind merely a residuum, an imprint left in her brain by the primary when it had left for the ingot. So when Bamobah talked about the being that had left, she couldn’t have used another word than “I”.', 'For a second, I contemplated leaving the highway and taking a small detour to see the house up close, but I knew that Bamobah would refuse. Most metallurgists behaved just as she did: considered their residuals as strangers and kept them as far away as possible from their fortune, privacy, and friends. It was the simplest and most reliable way to avoid trouble surrounding the return, the realliance shock and the psychological paradox of coinciding memories.', 'When we lay on a beach later that evening under the starry sky and listened to the waves and the eerie song of the desert wind, Bamobah said into the darkness: “We’ll take a different route back.”', '“Is it the house? You don’t want to see it?”', '“I don’t want you to see it. Not now. Perhaps when I come back.”', 'Something clenched inside me and the stars became millions of eyes staring at me from the dark heights. Bamobah was rolling grains of sand on my belly pensively.', '“You have no idea how bad I wish…when this is over…when I come back…for us to…” she was struggling for words, but there were none for what she was attempting to say.', '“For us to still be friends?” I suggested.', '“For us to still be friends,” she echoed.', 'Friends? I had always thought we could be something more. I believed it.', 'We took a different route to the town the following day.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Another evening, a month or two earlier, I was returning the same way from an errand in the north. It was still cold and got dark early. With the coming night, cold swept over Piraka and lifted a veil of salty mist from the sea. Dusk sucked all colors and sounds from the town; I remember cars noiselessly creeping through the roads like night predators sweeping their territory with cold halogen lights. The red glow of their back lights stung my eyes. In my imagination, they became narrow slits through which you could glimpse the red-hot metal beings living inside.', 'I was hurrying to Bamobah, tired and looking forward to seeing her. I turned off the autopilot to drive faster. With every car I passed, my heart skipped a beat. I prolonged each green light in the way I needed. I thought I was a good driver. I knew the way by heart. And then my world was eclipsed by the side of a truck that emerged from another street, and I couldn’t stop despite slamming the brakes down, despite the scream coming from my mouth.', 'I had to close my eyes.', 'I won’t ever forget what I saw when I opened them again. The first foam blisters bloomed in the car’s hood around the site of impact. More and more were stemming from it like a slow-motion avalanche, like bubbles in boiling water. The structural memory of the metal woke up, disturbed from many years’ sleep by the energy of the impact. Hundreds of millions of high-angle grain boundaries oriented so that adjacent grains could slide the right way at the right time. Hundreds of millions of gas molecules trapped in interstitial places and Schottky’s grid defects, prepared to desorb into the budding pores. Hundreds of millions of antiphase boundaries of intermetallic ordering, capable of instant annihilation and pumping kilojoules and kilojoules of structural entropy into the material. Hundreds of millions of dislocations prepared to run along slip planes. Each microsecond a billion microstructural events so complex that I could barely imagine them. If I had driven a car whose deformation zones weren’t made of material modified by an in-situ metallurgist, I would have most likely been dead. Someone had spent weeks and weeks in the ingot to prepare the complex nanoarchitecture of defects and gradients. By lending its primary personality to the searing metal, someone had saved my life today. Someone like her.', 'I felt a strange relief, as if Bamobah was beside me suddenly, as if she embraced and stroked me. Instead, safety belts shifting their structure similarly to the car’s hood were holding me. When I unfastened the belts, and stumbled outside, dazed with adrenaline, I was smiling and tears streamed from my eyes. My hands shook when I was dialing the police and then the insurance company, but I didn’t stop smiling into the mist.', 'The real Bamobah did not embrace me when I finally got home two or three hours later. She sat with her knees pulled to her chin, staring at the phone before her. Only then I realized with horror that I hadn’t let her know. I started apologizing and explaining what had happened. Bamobah listened in silence, reserved and graceful like only she could master, and then said: “I was afraid I’d lose you.”', 'Perhaps at that moment, I realized how much I’d feared losing her.', '\\xa0', 'Some alloys can kill. Death may lurk inside the Guinier-Preston zones, and if not death, then at least transformation precluding return. Metallurgists know of these places and avoid them, surround them with walls of precipitates, concentration gradients and nanostructured boundaries. But, in a strange dual logic, even the most cautious ways through the ingot often lead them alluringly close to these places. There is a thin line between fear and temptation.', 'This is what the residual personalities fear most: that their primaries would willingly give up the option to become a human being again and decide to stay in the ingot until quenching. That they would cut their humanity off like when a tow plane cuts off a glider high in the clouds and leaves it to the whims of the wind. A metallurgist is a microstructural entity, it’s not human or animal, its consciousness isn’t necessarily bound to its physical integrity. It may still be present in the alloy when diamond saws bite hungrily into the ingot, it may live and sense under the fiery touch of milling cutters, in the racket of rolling mills, under the pounding of power forging hammers, within the crushing embrace of molds.', 'There are hints, and there is belief. There is a cult. There are residuals unable to make peace with their primaries’ death. They feel their presence in all the places where pieces of metallurgists from the ingots could have gotten. In turbine blades of aircraft engines, in micromanipulators, in biomechanical implants, in active rivets of architectural structures, in surgical instruments, in antennas of geostationary satellites.', 'They feel themselves to be a part of the…', 'Cloud.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '“I don’t like truth,” Faíd told me when we met face to face for the first and last time. “It reminds me of a spoiled brat from a ‘good’ family who doesn’t have to be smart, original or pleasant, but everyone feels he should come before others. If you’re convinced something is right, should you toss it away just because the truth is different?”', 'We sat in the Al Emerald hotel’s café in Piraka. Faíd fit in here perfectly. He looked like another tarnished ornament with his golden rings, greased hair and round face.', '“You see how honest I’m being with you? So return me the favor. Your girlfriend is a lovely woman. Charming. I understand your hopes in the realliance program. But let’s imagine how it goes: She returns into her organic body after nine months, tired and transformed by the long mission inside the ingot. Suddenly a stranger appears in the corner of her consciousness. Do you remember me? Do you love me? What do I mean to you? Are we living together? Sure, the steelworks will let you try the full realliance program so that she keeps her memories of you, after all you’re paying them to, but the success rate is three percent. Three percent!”', 'I kept fidgeting with my empty cup absently.', '“I asked you to see me because I believe that the steelworks can offer you something more. That I can offer you something more. But only assuming that you don’t hold to the truth.”', 'My mouth was dry and my gaze flickered between our table to the glass entrance and back, as if Bamobah could somehow appear there miraculously and save me before I did something crazy.', '“How much more?” I managed to say.', 'Faíd leaned back and smiled. “Nine point five percent.”', 'I knew that number. It haunted me in my dreams and gave me perverse hope. Nine point five percent of metallurgists were rumored not to return into their organic bodies after long shifts. The official numbers provided by the steelworks were a magnitude lower and blurred by interpretations in the media. But this was what the bad news said: nine and a half percent.', '“You’re talking about the Cloud?”', 'Faíd didn’t speak, but his eyes said yes.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'We went to Karshad by train. It was Bamobah’s idea: “We may meet in the same coupé on the way back. We may start a conversation.”', 'Her certainty about the failure of the full realliance gave me chills. But I just said: “That could happen.”', 'We passed by the monotonous desert landscape, dry, bleak, scarred by the disharmony of dusty roads and concrete houses.', '“When you’re inside,” I asked Bamobah, who was clutching my hand absently, “what’s the most beautiful and impressive thing in there?”', 'She looked pensive for a split-second, but answered in a voice that allowed no hesitation: “Spinodal decompositions. Everyone loves the world under a spinodal curve. Every single metallurgist will tell you that nothing compares to that. And they would be right.”', 'She was shaking and staring out of the window.', '“Tell me more about it.”', '“You know, all the other changes, formation of microstructures, precipitation, coalescence – all of that starts somewhere. With lattice defects, impurities. There are tiny germs, nucleation sites, like when plants grow out of seeds. It’s different under the spinodal curve. Everything happens at the same time, and everywhere at once. Imagine two phases, like two different metals to simplify the example. They’re perfectly mixed above a certain temperature, create one crystal lattice together and you can’t tell them apart. You’re above their segregation threshold – the spinodal curve. But then something changes. You make a few endothermic operations and the system falls under the threshold. Everywhere, completely everywhere, there are suddenly two markedly different components mixed so thoroughly that it defies their nature. Where they grow apart, each creates its own tiny world. And you, before the diffusion bridges restore your integrity, grow apart too.”', 'Bamobah continued for a while, but I couldn’t listen anymore. I watched her mouth move, but sound went through me like through a paper screen. I wondered whether I could write a news story like that. One that would start as one person’s story but then would, without those seeds, without grains, divide into two. And I, the narrator, would be a part of both. But then, when the train shook suddenly, it occurred to me that I’m living such a story. While Bamobah was baring the innermost feelings of her self to me, the self I had never met, I was thinking about my work.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'For some time ago Bamobah told me: “In-situ metallurgy is a little like writing stories. If you write a story, you have to take your self and carry it into a new world. Do what you need there, and then come back. But you leave traces of yourself in those stories, in the ink of the letters. I leave traces of myself in dislocations, vacancies, antiphase boundaries. So when a metallurgist decides to stay in the microstructure and become a part of the Cloud, it’s a matter of quantity – ', ' of yourself you leave inside. Quality is already a given: you’re inside. Forever. But hasn’t it ever happened that a writer had gone crazy and decided to stay inside their fictional world?”', 'I had no answer for that. I wrote articles, not fiction. I was just an observer; on the contrary, I was careful to leave as few traces of myself as possible in what I wrote. Yet when I found some of my older articles, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that my younger self was speaking to me from every sentence.', 'Had Bamobah felt like that when she glimpsed a glider in the sky, when she put on her watch, when medical probes from precious inert alloys touched her body while I waited outside?', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'One’s identity is a fragile thing. It starts forming deep in the prenatal development and gains its final shape, passing the barrier of consciousness, after several years’ life. It resembles a thin-walled glass bowl: you cannot easily break it in two pieces and seal them again without leaving scars.', 'The first attempts at writing a human mind into the metal microstructure had ended tragically. Not by death, but something very much resembling death. Yet it was still worth it for the steelworks to invest billions more into continuing research to finally learn this: if metallurgists return into their human bodies after shifts and bring their memories and experience from the ingot with them, they had to bring back and forth their identity, their primary self, unequipped by our evolution to be at two places at once and then be sealed back together.', '“I assume you understand the principles of the realliance program,” Faíd said to me. “They prepare a very simplified microstructural being for you and allow you to copy your basic traits into it, just a weak imprint of your identity and a short request to be included in the realliance.”', 'Yes, I’d tried many times to imagine what it would be like when the steelworks connect me to the metallurgists’ interface. Would I follow Bamobah into the ingot? Actually not, just a shadow of myself would take the journey in there, resembling the shadow I knew as Bamobah, the shadow I clung to so desperately.', 'That’s what Faíd was saying in different words: “It will be mirroring of sorts – while your primary self will stay in the macroscopic world with the residual personality of your girlfriend, her primary would meet a being bearing a simplified version of your residual. Unless there are compatibility issues, which are quite common, the metallurgist will absorb this being and carry it with herself into her human brain. This prevents greater blurring of secondary memories about you. As the primary self of your lovely friend will continue regaining control over her physical body, she’ll be able to freely decide if she keeps those memories, while experiencing a mild realliance shock, or she filters them out.”', 'If I could fall in love with a shadow, could she? That was the most important question.', 'But you don’t say such questions out loud. “So how can you steer the process?”', '“I?” Faíd acted his mix of indignant and amused surprise well. “I can’t. But you can. You lack training and experience, your imprint cannot stay in the ingot too long without the risk of damaging it by some ill-advised operation. That is why the microstructure they eventually prepare for you is very simple…and very flexible.”', 'He handed me a small envelope. When it landed in my palm, I felt something small and metallic in the corner.', '“Something else can be covertly copied into the microstructure along with the fragments of your mind. A Trojan horse, if you want. It will adjust the realliance algorithms slightly, so that your friend would suddenly face a much more simple decision. Either she accepts you in the process, or refuses realliance altogether. Refuses to come back.”', '“My god,” I breathed out. The envelope slid out of my sweating fingers.', '“No one will ever know, I can assure you of that. It’s just that you’ll need to learn to live with a small lie. But you’ll live happily.”', 'Faíd wasn’t offering me nine point five percent. He was offering me a hundred.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'I couldn’t sleep.', 'I listened to Bamobah’s soft breathing and the subdued sounds of the hotel. On this background, the creaking of a drawer of my nightstand being slowly pulled out sounded almost deafening. I waited a few seconds to see whether Bamobah would wake up, but when the rhythm of her breath didn’t change, I reached in the drawer for an envelope. The chip was still inside, a small hard clump of a malign tumor inside the pristine paper tissue.', 'All it would take was to put the chip under my tongue and let it grow into the lower palate. Like when you take a pill. A remedy for your trouble.', 'Faíd’s plan was good. He thoroughly erased all traces between me and him, and him and the steelworks. I could only speculate what path had led him toward me. Belief in the Cloud, however absurd at first sight, was shifting the bedrock of society, crawling through its subconscious. While the steelworks fed it, while they supported it by the occasional shrouded comments in the press, while they pretended to finance research on the phenomenon of the Cloud, the ingots where metallurgists had become trapped remained in the center of attention of cranks, obscure researchers and loonies. Including the very, very rich. An ingot could be worked normally, molded, sold, put in the accounting. But there was still a lot of space for shreds, allowed waste quotas, shavings. Trash containing tiny fragments of primaries quenched into stillness. Heaps of strange relics to whom some attributed even stranger features.', 'I wondered how Faíd picked the right clients in the piles of realliance program requests. Those easily manipulated, unscrupulous, who end up with an envelope in their hands. I must have been a sure bet. A naïve European journalist, a reporter who fell in love with a mysterious woman. In fact, I could have been suspicious: am I just pretending all of it to get inside the steelworks’ dirt to expose them in the press? I had to smile wryly at the thought. No, on the very contrary. I was an easy mark and Faíd recognized that.', 'The chip still lay in its envelope, but I already felt its pressure under my tongue. If you set the rules right, you can’t lose. My rules were set by Faíd and his by the cult of the Cloud. Both of us would win, no matter what. But Bamobah? Which Bamobah? The gentle, joyful, empathic woman I knew and loved, or the strange one who was supposed to get ahold of the body calmly breathing on the other bed, like some sort of a parasite?', '“Cling to the concept of the Cloud,” Faíd told me before we parted ways, “don’t ever doubt it. Because you need a living woman beside you. And to live will be the same as to believe in the Cloud for your friend. Don’t let her doubt it for a second. Otherwise you’ll really lose her, and this time, I won’t be able to help you.”', 'Yes, I’ll have to believe in the Cloud. Not just because of Bamobah, but because of myself. I need to believe that metallurgists are everywhere around us, scattered throughout our technology, in the key parts of our civilizations.', 'Because otherwise what I’m contemplating is nothing but murder.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Copyright © 2018 by Hanuš Seiner', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Brent Hardy-Smith']}\n"

In her honest moments she assumed he still felt bad things about her too, but now she would never know.', 'So it came as a complete surprise when she received a letter from a lawyer named Bellport saying she had been left something in his will.

Could this be delayed payback from beyond the grave?', '\\xa0', 'His handwriting.

He seemed to be as excited about the relationship as she was, and that thrilled her even more.', 'To her great embarrassment, the first time they spent the night together, she did the writing thing in her sleep.

When she tried to explain that she was helpless to stop the gesture, he shook his head and said he thought it was fascinating. Maybe her subconscious was writing a book while she slept—a novel or a memoir. “That’s a book I’d want to read!” he joked, and she could tell it was not meant in any mean way.', 'She was rueful, and sort of whispered, “Or maybe it’s a horror novel.”', 'He wouldn’t accept it.

As he spoke and smiled and spun his thoughts, she stared at him, at his nice, open face, and fell for him ten times more.', 'After that night, she almost never did skywriting again when they were together. She felt relieved, no matter how accepting he was about it. Who does such things in their sleep? She had already been told by her last lover that she had her “quirks,” and this new one was a doozy no matter how you looked at it.', 'She assumed she didn’t do it around the new man because he had some kind of calming effect on both her conscious and unconscious minds. It certainly felt like it. She slept better when they were together; she was much happier in general since meeting him. One afternoon they were watching an old Preston Sturges film on TV. During a commercial, he killed the sound and asked what was on her bucket list. What would she like to do or see or possess before she died? He was serious—she could tell he really wanted to know. It was one of his most endearing qualities—he wanted to know her better than any man she’d ever been with. He wanted to know about her past, her dreams, hopes, fears, the things about herself she felt pride in.', 'Without hesitating, which was normally not her way of doing things because she was careful and circumspect, she said immediately, “Nothing. I realized the other day there is nothing more I want in my life than what I have right now.” She started to tear up. She turned her head to one side and wiped her eye with a thumb. He took her hand. She shook her head and smiled. “Part of it is because of you, part is because things are just good in my life right now. Not perfect and not Oz or anything, but good. Do you know what I mean? I don’t think I’ve ever felt like this. Before, there was always something in the way of happiness, or something that needed correcting, or I felt that life would be better if it were just a little bit more this way or that. But I don’t feel any of those things lately. It feels like life is my friend these days. ”', 'It stayed her friend for a long time afterward. The skywriting continued, but she grew sort of used to it. If she woke in the middle of the night and saw her arm up there in the air doing its writing thing, she just pulled it gently back down like you’d rearrange an infant’s outstretched arm as it slept in its cradle.', 'She was given a raise at her job. Her new man took her along on a business trip to Dublin, where one night, in a century-old pub near the river, two tall men with ginger hair stood up and sang an a cappella version of “On Raglan Road” so sad, mysterious and… ', ' that she knew instantly this was one of the greatest, most perfect moments of her life. Too often we miss the full greatness of these moments even when we’re right in the middle of living them. Why? Because we’re distracted by the dull hum and buzz of our every day, the annoying white noise and gigabytes of trivia filling the hard drive of our thoughts. Sadly, we race past the rare perfect times half attentively and too fast, seeing them, experiencing them, but not really. Like looking out the window of a speeding train at an amazing medieval castle perched on a cliff. Only later do we grasp what we’d seen and wish like hell we’d at least taken a picture.', '\\xa0', 'She didn’t see it at first when she got up at three a.m. one morning to go to the toilet. She was half awake, sleepy eyed, looking toward the bathroom. But when she returned and had gotten into bed, when she rolled onto her back, there it was: directly in the air above her, an arm’s length away, was writing. Lines of words in vivid silver lettering above the bed; words written in her/his singular script. They hung there suspended, beautiful in the dark like glittering silver tinsel on a Christmas tree.', 'Slowly, she raised a hesitant arm and tried to touch them. Her fingers went right through the letters, but they did not disappear. She waved a hand back and forth across the words, across the sentences, across the air above her. Nothing—they did not move or go away.', 'What did they say? She couldn’t tell—it was a language she didn’t know or recognize. It was all eerie, frightening but also beautiful to see. Thin, silver-lettered sentences floating in the dark above in her own handwriting, his handwriting, the handwriting he had given her and she had made her own. What crossed her mind as she stared at it were the first words she’d ever written in his handwriting: ', 'instead of ', 'She reached over to a table next to the bed for the pad and pen she kept there alongside whatever book she was reading at the time. She loved copying down lines or passages that stuck out or had meaning to her. Of course she had a notebook specifically for collected quotes, now all written in her lovely new script. Propping herself up on one elbow, she copied the mysterious silver words onto the pad. She didn’t know what they meant but maybe in time she could find someone who did.', 'Or…', 'Excited by an idea, she got out of bed again and after a last glance at the words still hanging in the air, she left the room and walked a few steps over to her small study. Switching on the computer there, she waited for it to boot up. Once it did, she went to a universal language translation site, typed in the words written on the pad, told the site to “detect language” and then translate them into English.', 'The doorbell rang. It was three o’clock in the morning. Seconds later it rang again. Rising from the chair in front of the computer without having seen the translation, she walked to the front door, pausing only to pick up the gray aluminum baseball bat she kept leaning against a nearby wall for just such an occasion, not that she’d ever had to use it before now.', 'She stood up against the door, both hands on the bat, and looked through the peephole out into the hallway. Standing there, immaculately dressed in a blue pinstripe suit, white shirt, and dark tie (at three o’clock in the morning) was the lawyer, Bellport.', 'As if he knew exactly when she was looking, he held up a brown paper bag next to his face and said cheerily, “I brought brownies from Bouchon! I know you love ’em!”', 'Confused and totally hyped up by what she thought was a threat seconds ago, she leaned the bat against a wall, undid the locks, and opened the door.', '“What are you ', ' here?”', '“Can I come in? I know it’s late but we have things to discuss. If you want, we can do it out here, but—”', 'Hesitantly, unhappily, she stepped aside and gestured for him to enter. She pointed him down the hall toward the living room. He moved and she followed. Glancing at the baseball bat, she thought about taking it along just in case, but shook her head.', 'Bellport plunked down on her small couch and opened the bag. Bringing it up to his face, he inhaled deeply. He shook his head at the lusciousness of the aroma inside. Next he took out two of the obscenely expensive brownies and placed them in the center of a lime green cloth napkin, also from inside the bag. He gestured for her to have one but she said no. He shrugged and took one. Holding an open hand under his mouth to catch any crumbs, he took a big bite and closed his eyes while chewing. From the ecstatic look on his face, the man knew how to enjoy a brownie.', '“Why are you here?” In spite of her uneasiness, she could feel fatigue streaming back into her like honey poured into a bowl. She needed to be sharp and alert. But for God’s sake—it was the middle of the night and the last hour had been one bizarreness after another, topped off now by this lawyer eating brownies on her couch at three a.m.', 'He held up a finger for her to wait a sec while he swallowed the last bite. On finishing, he shook his head at its scrumptiousness, brushed off his hands, and smiled.', '“It’s part of the history of the future.”', '“What is?” She sat down on the far end of the couch.', '“The writing above your bed; the writing you’ve been doing in your sleep the last few months. It’s all part of the history of the human future. You couldn’t understand any of the words you’d written because none of them had happened yet. As soon as they do, you’ll recognize them. But this is not important now.”', '“Are you going to eat this?” He pointed at the second brownie. She shook her head. He picked it up, smelled it, and took a bite. A few crumbs fell off his lip. He touched his mouth in embarrassment. “Sorry. But it just tastes so good.”', '“I’ve been doing this for months? Writing silver words in my sleep?”', '“Yes, the moment you chose to change your handwriting permanently to his. Remember when we first met I said you didn’t have to use it at all? But once you voluntarily made the change, you became a historian. It’s what happens when you choose the handwriting. This is how it works.”', '“How ', ' works?”', '“The process. Mankind creates its future by its actions in the present. What you do today will usually determine what you do or what happens to you tomorrow. Think of it on a giant scale and you get an idea of the amount of data that must be recorded before the future is determined. Historians collect and record the data. You’re one of them now.”', '“But I don’t ', ' anything. My life isn’t special or interesting and I don’t even know what I’m writing in my sleep. So how does any of it help to plot the human future?” Her voice was all sarcasm.', 'Bellport raised his hand as if to get her full attention. “Remember when you were in school and the science teacher said humans only use a small portion of our brains to live? Well, very much simplified, what you’re writing in your sleep are the observations of ', ' the things your brain is registering, ', ' the time. Now multiply it by millions: Millions of historians recording what they have experienced for the past two hundred thousand years. They don’t need every person’s history—just a cross section of humanity is enough. Part of the knowledge you’ve accumulated just by living is what will happen to you in the future. Yes, somewhere in your mind you know what will happen to you tomorrow and for the rest of your life. Some of it is what you wrote tonight and why you can’t read it yet. When all of the human brain is working and producing information, it’s a wondrous machine. It knows almost no limits.”', 'She swallowed her incredulity and doubts for a moment and, going along with what he’d just said, asked the obvious question. “What do they do with this information we give them?”', '“Sift through, refine it, and cull what they consider unnecessary things. Ultimately use what they keep to design the future of humanity. From what I understand, they put the pieces together like an ever-expanding jigsaw puzzle.”', 'She crossed her arms, unconvinced. “If ', ' so powerful, why do we need to write it? Why can’t they just read our minds?”', '“Because writing is a human invention and how we convey our experience to each other. Through writing and speaking. There are some historians—”', 'She cut him off. “Who probably ', ' in their sleep without knowing what they’re saying.”', 'He popped the rest of the brownie into his mouth and nodded.', '“Who are ', '?”', 'If she expected him to say something stunning like ', ' or ', ', she was disappointed. He shook his head and smiled. “I have no idea. The only thing I’ve been told is that the answer is so complex it’s like string theory multiplied by a hundred.”', 'She stood up, annoyed and tired and scared and other ugly things. Things she couldn’t put a finger on if you asked her to explain, but she didn’t like feeling them, not at all. These feelings were all roiling around inside her like ten hamsters running madly inside their wheels. “How do I know any of this is true? How do I know it’s not all bullshit?”', 'Bellport answered in a calm voice. “Fair question. Go back into your bedroom and take a look. I’ll wait here.”', 'She had never been afraid to go into her bedroom—quite the opposite. It was her sanctuary, her fortress of solitude against the world when it turned nasty on her. But she was afraid now.', 'The writing above the bed was still there. The beautiful silver letters spelling out some enigmatic who knows what.', 'No, wait, that wasn’t true.', 'Closer to the bed she realized she now understood several of the words she’d written there. Not many, but a few. She saw ', ' and ', ' and… ', '. Reaching out to touch them, her fingers passed right through… She touched ', ', then closed her hand around it, as if trying to catch a firefly. When she opened it again, the word she had thought about and sometimes hoped for and sometimes cried about over the years sat unmoving in the middle of her hand.', '“How many?”', 'She turned and saw Bellport standing in the doorway.', '“How many ', '?”', '“How many words do you understand there now?”', '“Three.”', '“It’s a beginning.”', '“One of them is ‘marriage.’” She didn’t know if the word came out of her mouth surprised or shy.', '“Is that good? Do you want it?” His voice was kind.', '“Yes, I think so. But why am I seeing it now when, from what you say, I’ve been doing this since I changed to his handwriting?”', '“Because it’s the first time you see the words. And now you recognized some of what you’ve written.”', '“But I didn’t recognize any of them when I first saw them before.”', 'He slid his hands into his pockets. “This is why I came. Because just actually seeing them for the first time is the formal beginning of the process for you. The next question is, do you want to continue? You’re only asked once and the decision is final. So think carefully before you answer.”', '“The more I do this writing for the future, will I be able to recognize more of the words? Will I be able to see more of my ', ' future?”', '“Depends on the person. Your friend was very aware of when he was going to die long before he did. He said it was one of the reasons why he broke up with you—to spare you having to be around him at the end. It’s also why he willed the handwriting to you when he did. It must be formally passed on whether it’s the handwriting or the voice.”', 'She couldn’t resist. “Even cavemen passed it on ', ' ', ' years ago?”', 'Bellport smiled. “You’ve seen the cave paintings at Lascaux. Those guys were very adept at communicating. So yes, even they had their ways of passing it on.', '“If you accept, you’re required to formally pass it on too, at some point. But remember, knowing your future is not always a good thing. It can stain a life. Or ruin it. Just so you know—he loved you very much. He said you were the only person he had ever completely trusted. It may sound trite, but he said very passionately he ', ' in you. That’s why he wanted you to have the handwriting—so you could decide if you wanted to use it. Obviously there are many other people doing this, many people contributing. But if you choose to do it too, you’ll be part of shaping humanity’s future, and that is no small thing.”', '“Mr. Bellport, who are you?”', '“Just the messenger. No more and no less.”', 'Looking at him, thinking about all of this, she remembered the first time she had written like the dead man. She tried to write the word ', ' but instead wrote ', '. What did it mean? Was it a message from him in death? Or from some secret part of her own brain telling her to be careful—don’t get played. Or maybe it was saying don’t plagiarize, this is not what you should be doing. Or maybe—', 'She turned back to the words, so silver and beautifully written, floating in the air. Running a finger beneath one of the sentences, she knew whatever she decided now would change everything.', 'And then, in the midst of this mind-flurry of thoughts blowing every which way, it suddenly came and hit her hard: He had loved her. He had really loved her, and much of what he had done to drive her away was not because of cruelty but because he wanted to spare her even greater pain and loss when he grew sicker. And when he was gone there was this final gift to her, the handwriting. The astonishing gift would enable her to know her future even though he knew he would not be part of it.', 'It had always been such an ugly mystery to her—why he had been so awful at the end of their relationship. Now she knew why. The mystery was solved in the most beautiful, heartbreaking way possible. He had pushed her away when he needed her most. She hated him for doing it, now she knew the truth. At the same time she also loved him like she had never loved him before—for exactly the same reason. The mystery was solved, and with it came her answer.', 'She looked at Bellport and said, “No. I don’t want it.”', 'He said nothing, waiting for her to continue.', '“If I know what’s going to happen to me, then there’s no mystery in life. Mystery, just in general, is one of the greatest things we’ll ever experience—having mysteries in our lives and now and then solving them. Sometimes solutions to our mysteries suck, but sometimes they’re so incredibly beautiful…', '“Let someone else write our future history, Mr. Bellport. I want my life to be full of mysteries right up until the end.”', 'He bowed his head, smiled, and reached into a pocket for a folded piece of paper. Handing it to her, he said, “He thought you would say no. If you did, he wanted me to give you this before I left. I’ll let myself out.”', 'When the lawyer was gone, she unfolded the paper. On it, in that beautiful, beautiful script, were the complete lyrics to the song “On Raglan Road.” At the bottom of the paper he had written, “I knew this much about your future but no more. Travel well without knowing what’s next. I wish I had.”', 'Copyright © 2018 by Jonathan Carroll', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Armando Veve']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['The Heart of Owl Abbas'], 'Author': ['Kathleen Jennings'], 'Body': ['A composer in an unstable city-state accidentally discovers the perfect singer for his work—a clockwork man—and sows the seeds of revolution.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Once, before the great Empire of Else enveloped the land between the red mountains and the quiet sea, the city-state of Owl Abbas was a mere bird-haunted forest temple. But protected by treaties, suffocated by safety and benevolent neglect, it had swollen and grown in upon itself, roiling and fomenting, so slowly that only (perhaps) a few dust-dry wraiths of abbots hanging motionless in enclosed footings of the Palace Aster would have marked the change from one century to another.', 'The gains and losses of its citizenry had been gradual. Its resentments and injustices oozed like moisture down the dank wall of a forgotten reservoir, unremarked by either the clustered, crushing commonality or the Little Emperor, cloyed and gorged in his great gilt chambers. ', ', until the dark water was high against its bowed, ill-repaired walls. Until it lapped at the foundations of palace and hovel alike.', '\\xa0', 'In all Owl Abbas, before it burned (after the Falling but before the Cartographer’s War and the Recurrence of Owls), there were among its many windows only two that need concern us.', 'The first was fogged with spider webs. It belonged to a garret, precarious above the spring-carts and spirit-lamps of Petty Street. Behind it was installed a wretched scribbler, who eked out a living writing songs for the populace. Let us call him Excelsior, for that is the name with which he signed his work.', 'Across the cobbleskulls and flints, and a full other storey over that abyss of jam merchants and glove-skinners that was Petty Street, above the hanging signs of teahouse and slop house, workhouse and whorehouse, higher even than the knotwork of laundry-, bell-, delivery- and ladder-strings, was another, airy casement.', 'The tenant of that room was only recently arrived to Owl Abbas—itinerant, mendicant, but admitted at the Mountain Gate because of the journeyman’s seal it bore on one exquisite brass shoulder. Even had the gate guards consulted the annals of the Elevated Guild of Horologists and Artificers, they would have found no reason to turn aside the masterpiece of an obscure craftswoman whose exile was self-imposed. Wonders, then, were a daily import of the palace, and—hemmed in as the city-state was by ancient vows and the benign disregard of the Empire of Else, in whose armpit it festered—the peace of the Little Emperor of Owl Abbas was threatened by nothing but thieves.', 'Excelsior, who seldom ventured even to his window, let alone to the street, had never seen this neighbour, whom time would call the Nightingale. From his lower garret, Excelsior could glimpse only a ceiling painted with blue dove-shadows and rose-gold candle-glow.', 'He could, however, hear the Nightingale’s voice. Pure and high, discs of spinning glass singing against chamois, it fell like tumbling bells, like spilled silver wires.', 'It sang “Love Like the Guillotine,” “The Too-Taut Heart”, “When I am Duke of Petty Street (You Shall Be the Clown)”—all the choruses bawled by rampant youth loitering over gutters below, trilled by the delivery boatmen in the oily, olive canals, hummed even by agued ancients scrubbing the pearl-floored halls of the Palace Aster. Cheap songs. Excelsior’s.', 'He could have written a dozen more like them in his sleep, for his scribbling of lyric and melody, accompaniment and refrain was a mechanical task, calibrated to please the fecund and fickle tastes of the crowds of Owl Abbas, their perennial lusts and losses.', 'And what appetites for music that city-state had then, for all its decay and poverty! Forgotten were the bone groves and the quietude of owleries that once nested where the city had grown. The last owl-abbots were long starved in the gutters where they had begged, their skulls cambering the roadway. The owls had departed the sleepless streets for the zoological gardens of Else and the monk’s-fringe forests of the red mountains. Now, though the finest delights were reserved for the Little Emperor, balladuellists caterwauled on roofsheets; ladies’ cantating parrots swung in brass rings; lovers in teahouses threw coins into the throats of cheap songboxes, to wind the gears that set the teeth that struck the notes from the spinning metal tongues, sending slivers of copper to Excelsior, that he might buy ink and nibs and spirit-oil, cheap paper, wine hard as a fist and, when he remembered, a little bread.', 'Rough songs he wrote, like all the lesser scribblers of Owl Abbas. Raw songs, tunes to dull sense and sensation, ditties to hem in a little portion of pleasure between hunger and the grave.', 'Excelsior had never crept out of his garret to crouch at the outer palace walls to hear rare notes escaping from an Imperial Performance. Nor had he attended the Collegiate Academy of Guilded Instrumentalists, which existed to supply the artful music of the palace: formal stylings for sleep and dressing and every course of a dozen served at each of the eight tables laid daily for the Little Emperor. Even had Excelsior done so, he would not have heard anything to match the Nightingale’s abilities.', 'He listened to the deconstructed threads and parts, the wheeling, rewriting rehearsals, the little broken, mended, rough-edged fantasias with which the Nightingale warmed and amused the bright apartment, there above Petty Street, in that merryloud quarter of Owl Abbas where surely no one who mattered could overhear. The Nightingale, learning the music of the streets, the heartbeat of the city.', 'Bells and wires and strings, keys and barrels and tumblers, reeds and pipes, skin and wind. Melody, harmony, disingenuous discord. The heart and throats of caged larks, of free birds, of trained choristers. All these were in the voice of the Nightingale.', 'But the voice carried, as the bounty of the palace never did. From Petty Street to the knotted alleys of the Maresnest, from Agnes Lane where once a disgraced clockmaker had kept her stinking workshop, to the last nested hovel before the avenue of guildhalls. Though neither understanding nor caring, the denizens of Owl Abbas stepped a little more lightly, laboured with an ear half-turned, unwitting, to those strains.', 'Excelsior eked out the end of the daylight, the nightlight, the moonlight, the ghostlight. He scrimped and slaved until he gathered courage and words enough to light a fire-inch and burn a whole pennyweight of ground copper. He offered the coin to the Phantom of the Window-sash, and summoned that obscure spirit almost to its full weight of feathers and claws.', 'The Phantom of the Window-sash was not a shade that embraced change. It had once had its own antique, unmusical views on such matters as songlust and bodymusic. But those, like the shade itself, were the shabbiest of memories.', 'Summoned by the soul of coins, it obeyed its commission without remark. Clustering Excelsior’s rolled onionskin to its vanishingly sharp breastbone, the phantom fell from the garret sill—fell, then lifted on a gust of oil-spiced laughter to the glowing window opposite and there dissolved before the Nightingale could question it, leaving its dry burden to flutter on the floor.', 'Excelsior could not watch.', 'He hauled closed the leaning shutters and pulled down the sash, cross-latched it and rubbed drawing gum along the edges. He etched more webs into the panes, spitting glass like flour from beneath his good penknife, that his garret might look tenantless. He raked the curtains across, pinning pumice-cloth and blotting paper over the moth holes.', 'Then for good measure he put out writing-lamp, hearth-glow, bed-candle and moth-pilot, closed his eyes, and waited.', 'He waited for three clock-unwinding days, feeling the long springs of his world loosen, while the ink crusted in the glass well and the nibs began to rust in the little moisture from the breath of creeping rats or spiders.', 'On the third day, a thrill stirred the dull panes, the curtains. Excelsior could not have told when it had begun. He crouched, resolutely unhoping.', 'The insinuation became a hum, a melody. Excelsior heard what had never been heard before, except in the signs and symbols of his dark garret, in his private equations: the song he had composed in the light of the last of his lamp-spirits, for which he had burned the last coin; the paper words for which he had sent the phantom winging.', 'The Nightingale’s voice, now, was a high, thin curling, like the frost on a glass of Abbas-White, or like red snow curling off the tops of the mountains. It was melody uncomplicated by harmony or the thrilling trills of ornament, tentative only in its simplicity, the singer’s questing guided by all the confidence of the supreme master of an art.', 'Over and again that voice followed Excelsior’s script, the words seeking notes, notes seeking paths as water flows across a dry land. Then gradually that glass-and-golden voice found a pattern, gathered force, rilled and frothed along the edges of its new-cut banks, built undertows and laughing sprays of sound. It poured down through the alleys where craftsmen and labourers starved, trickled through Agnes Lane where a young clockmaker had once studied the grafting of metal to splintered bone, curling into the inlooped ways of the great warren of the Maresnest.', 'High over Petty Street, the Nightingale sang for the first time Excelsior’s composition—not a commission, not a command, but… Well, even the scribbler could not have said whether it had been gift, or tribute or sacrifice.', 'The Nightingale sang and Excelsior, weak with waiting, listened.', 'He wrote another, immediately he had revived. It was unworthy. Dissatisfied, he broke it apart into bare penny-shave popular ditties. Ragged and rancid, he did not care to take them down himself, but sent them by errand urchins to the punch-shop, where they were pricked relentlessly into parchment rolls and delivered to tea shops and pleasure warrens, fed into mere pinching, playing songchests, which nipped fingers as well as paper, and singly-minded cranked out Excelsior’s abandoned tunes.', '“', ',” sang the high-painters in their blood-dipped, paint-dripped hats.', '“', ',” sang the menials toiling with bow-bent spines and mole-fur cloths along the Palace Aster wainscoting.', '“', ',” sang the xylophone-ribbed parrot trainers, chorusing from cage to cage, that their clients’ birds might have the newest tunes.', 'Excelsior, having ill considered how his words might be mis-sung, covered his ears against the rattle and racket of the streets, uncovered them again in terror that he might miss the Nightingale’s next effusive variations.', 'The copper slicings rattled up in the delivery basket. ', ', thought Excelsior. He could fit a new song to that high, rhythmless beat.', '\\xa0', 'The ghost of a sigh is a weighty thing. The Phantom of the Window-sash unfolded itself heavily into the haze of the copper-burnings, not in the least elevated by music.', 'It gathered up the onionskin in layers of ether and slunk to Excelsior’s window, sagged over the sill, bore itself by grudging degrees up layers of garlic breath, pipe smoke, midden scent, fresh soap, crushed leaves, and wet feathers to the higher floor, opposite.', 'If Excelsior could have seen, he would have watched in affront as it uncoiled, graceless, and spilled on the ruddy tiles his heart’s offering, his hope of immortality.', 'Now, ghosts are little more than animate nostalgia. New songs in old patterns were a sop, a soporific, and old songs by new singers no more than reinforced the rule of the city. But so fine a thing as the scribbler and the singer together might make was a danger to the unquestioned squalor, the eternal twilight, the restlessness without ambition, the struggle over no more than bread and beds, which were the groundwork of the Little Emperor’s reign, the foundation of the false peace of Owl Abbas.', 'The phantom lay unspooled on the cool tiles until the Nightingale, shod in shell and horn, clicked and bent to it and lifted spirit and onionskin together.', 'The sheets of music, raw as bone, fresh as blood, lured the singer, but the spirit was a tragedian. How it dangled and feinted.', 'Sensibility is the stock-in-trade of any performer, long dead or unliving. The Nightingale set the song aside and attended the messenger.', 'Burnt feathers revived the spirit a little, burnt copper restored it, a dusting of finger-chalk to better reveal its form the phantom found quite unnecessary. It arched itself grateful and looping around the bronze joints, the magnificent alabaster throat of its benefactor.', '“Strange spirit,” said the Nightingale. “Were you bird once? Are you, then, the heart of Owl Abbas? If so, I have been overwrought, and you were easier to capture than my maker thought.”', ', its spasm of ghostly laughter implied. It was a humble ghost, dusty and old. Far below the notice of such as the Nightingale.', 'The Nightingale’s maker had never been interested in spirit, only in the melding of metal with flesh—had, indeed, taken her leave of Owl Abbas when the Guild mocked her designs for a Patent Brass Hip, a Magnetic Hand, a Better Limb, as an affront and bastardisation of their craft. The phantom’s claim therefore satisfied the Nightingale. It turned to the onionskins and began to try the first notes, the melodies.', ', the lingering spirit insinuated with little shivers and purrs. ', ' marvelous ', ', the phantom’s mummery suggested. ', '.', ' it implied, draping affectionately about the mark of the Nightingale’s distant maker, ', '.', ' that ', '.', 'The Nightingale saw the force of the argument. Its throat, the chords strung within, these articulations of wrist and jaw, had been crafted and calibrated for a high purpose: to seize the heart of Owl Abbas. Where else might a city’s heart be found?', 'So it was towards the Palace Aster that the Nightingale sang.', '\\xa0', 'Excelsior, having at last in hope opened curtain, sash and shutter, did not at first notice the added distance in the Nightingale’s voice. He lingered, nib held clear of the thirsty paper, and drank in the tentative, tender explorations, the strengthening resolve, the removal of magnificent veils of possibility to reveal the song more truly than he had written it.', 'Petty Street had proved an impassable chasm before this, even to those robust enough to dare its buffeting. It was possible, in the scheme of the city, with its streets like the whorls of an ear, branching like veins, looped like a brain, that Excelsior might never see the Nightingale. He believed he did not care. It was the ', ' that captured him, reverberating in the hollows of his thin chest, fluttering and rebounding there like a second soul.', 'Abruptly anxious, he cleaned the crust of ink from the pen, the settling dust from his paper, and began again.', ',', '.', 'No.', '.', 'Again, he scratched out the words.', 'That was awkward, presumptuous, and wrong. Excelsior nearly tore up the paper, but the thought of copper arrested him. Coins meant ink and nibs, castor oil and onionskin and the services of a courier.', 'Out went the lesser tunes, into the kettle-arcades and the dance-alleys, out to the earnest, workaday singers who would seek no subtlety or layers in words that had been dreamed up for nothing ', ' nuance. Out to listeners who, unwitting, had already been half-woken by the Nightingale’s art, and whose nascent hunger other scribblers, other singers—themselves starved—hastened to fill with words not of old complacencies but with a mimicry of Excelsior’s dim longings.', 'At last, like the heart of a thistle, the pure, bitter core of a song emerged from the peeled-back pages. This, thought Excelsior, was fitting tribute and sacrifice.', 'Out in the streets, languishing, lusting idlers and iron-bitten, fire-calloused labourers hammered out his ballads with all the delicacy of a beam on a bell. Excelsior took his thin levy of their trade and burned it to the Phantom of the Window-sash, which, for once, appeared with alacrity, an eager whiplash of air.', '“Take this to the Nightingale,” Excelsior bid it, as if the spirit did not know where all his thoughts were trained.', '\\xa0', 'The Nightingale’s voice had been borne by breeze and breath in through the windows of the Palace Aster, where it reached the ring-heavy ears of the Little Emperor, as he lay on his back in his vast bed at owl-light, as was his custom, weighted with ennui, calcified with alarm. The fears of the Little Emperor were many: that he might never know delight again; that the vast Empire of Else would outstrip him in its discovery of luxuries; that emissaries from a distant land, consumed with envy, would break into the storerooms of the Palace Aster and find a jeweled gown, a pearl cup, a marvel from which he had not wearily drained the last honeysuckle spasm of pleasure.', '“That music,” he said, startling the doctors who, beaked and embroidered, bent over his bed, tempting him with rarities. “I want ', '.”', '“It is the windharps in the hanging gardens,” said his courtiers. “It is the song of the cocoon-tenders lulling their charges to sleep. It is the breeze in the vines where Abbas-White is grown.”', 'The Little Emperor was become petulant and particular with a surfeit of pleasures. “Then bring it to me!” he said.', 'They sent runners out into the streets, the gardens, the acre-width of tilled treaty-land that bordered Owl Abbas, and had windharps, silk-herders, vine-cuttings brought to the palace. All fell silent in the presence of the Little Emperor, but the miraculous voice continued.', 'The nobles went out themselves, questing and questioning, soft and perfumed and quilted, pomandered against the exhalation of rotting lungs, parasoled against the filth that spilled from windows. The grimy populace, more sullen and shouldersome than had been their wont, would not or could not tell them whence the song came. Above them, the soot-lunged chimney-urchins leaped and leered. So many shifts of them had tumbled and burned since the clockmaker of Agnes Street had proposed, to denouncement by the Guild, her Mechanical Bellows Suitable to Reside Within the Living Chest. But Excelsior’s words and the Nightingale’s song rang in their boxed and smoke-blocked ears, and as they spat down on the velvet caps fluttering with imported owl-feathers, the shining, circleted heads of the prim nobility, the urchins thought among themselves that ', ' heads would never fall to form the smallest cobbleskulls.', 'At last, as the Little Emperor grew restive, voicehounds were sent out. They went about the streets, leaping runnels of beery bravado. They heard, dismissive, Excelsior’s adulterated choruses rousing bottle-room and tap-house, they ducked unperturbed beneath the debased and stirring phrases whistled by rat-cullers and spring-winders. They clicked up the fingerstairs and along the cobbleskulls until they crowded together on Short Street, which runs beneath Petty Street, all their ears cocked to the sky, their small, weeping eyes turned to the garret where the Nightingale sang.', 'Arpeggios and wandering scales spilled like largesse, rich and fragrant on their collars and livery.', '\\xa0', 'The Phantom of the Window-sash, delivering its latest commission, let the onionskin spill like so many kitchen-sweepings over the Nightingale’s unclenching hands, to catch in the breeze and flicker out into Owl Abbas.', '. The little ghost coiled meaningful at the pulsing throat of the Nightingale, although each tremor, each tremolo shook it a measure further out of the world. ', '.', 'The Nightingale had little to prepare. The tiled room was already bare of all but the meanest necessities. The red lamp was put out, and brick and tile thus returned to their native pallor, all Petty Street and no memory of the far red mountains.', 'And thus, to the satisfaction of one insignificant spirit, the Nightingale was quit of Petty Street, and Petty Street was rid of the Nightingale.', 'All would be as it ought to be, as (to the frail, fond memory that was the phantom) it always had been. The singer would go to the Palace Aster, be admired, neglected, rusted out, and thrown into some storeroom, as is the fate of all fine things; the scribbler would go back to composing his cheap, satisfactory songs. At least, of these futures the ghost convinced itself.', '\\xa0', 'Excelsior gripped the sill like the jasmine-hawks in the highest towers of the Palace Aster, and listened. He tinkered a trumpet out of an abandoned horn, the better to funnel down to his garret the thinking murmurs, the trialled whispers of the Nightingale. He turned to that higher floor like a koncheomancer pressing against a shell for some rumour of the sea.', 'He heard the thin thunder of doves under slate, the earthquakes of spring-carts striking cobbleskulls, the rising roar of barter and banter, flattery and fatuous talk, threaded throughout with the discontenting repetition of his own words (tankards beating time like marching feet, lungs breathing defiance of harmony and melody alike, a formless rising tide). But no Nightingale.', 'Excelsior wore out his hopes and heart, burned all oil, spilled all ink. He crafted song after song, and even through his desperation he knew he had never written anything so fine. But the rare and blessed music was ashen beneath his pen.', 'Had it been this word, this note, this barest suggestion of weight or fire? In some way he had miswritten, misjudged.', 'Cautious even in despair, Excelsior shredded the gossamer spell into cheap sentiment and tramping rhythm, and sent it by nip-fingered courier below where, unintended, the words fell like fire-inches, like sparks in kindling.', ',', '.', ',', '.', '\\xa0', 'Few souls huddled in the dense miseries of Owl Abbas had ever mustered the will, the flash of flame, to strike out against the rule of the Palace Aster. What else, after all these centuries, had they to compare it to? They laboured, and they died. Even the clockmaker had only left, the better to complete her masterpiece: a singer that would conform faithfully to the restrictions and requirements of the Guild.', 'And then she had sent the Nightingale into the heart of Owl Abbas.', 'Oh, Petty Street and Agnes Lane, the Maresnest and the guildhalls had not ', '. But they had heard. The Nightingale’s voice had threaded through the work of commoner singers, lulling and lilting, softening the singeing qualities even of Excelsior’s misdirected ditties.', 'The abrupt absence of that voice was like a sinkhole in a street, a sucking emptiness tearing the fabric of Owl Abbas. The citizens did not know what they had lost, but they knew it was something vast: the view of the red snows which only the nimblest chimney-urchins had seen from afar, the rustle of star meadows through which none of them would stride, all the miles and idly strewn space the clockmaker had seen on her journey out of the city, the bright air and the silences of hills.', 'Through Owl Abbas, the rumour of loss spread like the slow groaning of an overburdened beam, the creak of a rookery from whose footings one stone too many has been scavenged. The city-state, close-pressed, was a bone-pile at the base of which one littlest vertebra, or smallest knucklebone, had crumbled to dust, with a breathy sighing-out of its ghost, threatening to bring the whole tumbling down. And into the silence, the strident notes of Excelsior’s thoughtlessly outflung songs rattled like dice.', '“Where ', ' the rose rooms? Whose are the star walks?” asked brewers and road-wives, wakening to the words. The catacomb-filers, who saw the paintings on the deepest, oldest walls, said, “Surely these images aren’t a dream. They are just there, within our reach. Did not we have them once? When the city was owl-quiet and the stacked houses were groves, when the Little Emperor’s Council was a parliament of birds, and their auguries guided us more fairly than ', '?”', 'The workhalls, the orphan-rows murmured with Excelsior’s songs—not the only songs of the city, but sudden-sharp and bracing—and pennies rolled into the mouths of the crank-singers. Barwashers hummed even as they watched their wakening clientele askance. Gross-bakers stamped the words with chalk-gravel and sawdust and the heels of their hands into the heavy half-day bread. Petit-bakers stretched and rolled them into the cobweb expanse of their thousand-layered sugar-dough. Seamsters and oxen-harriers who had never seen Petty Street built the words into the pattern of their bitternesses, knotted them into the whipstring lacing of coats, threaded the lyrics through the murmurations they took from door to door with barrelled oil and saffron.', '“', ',” they sang.', 'The words had been handed down with no thought to discontent and discord, untrimmed for any fire but that which lit Excelsior’s midnights.', 'Those who sang them did not look to the Nightingale’s room above Short Street and Petty Street (home now to three little, starved seamstresses such as might have welcomed a Mechanical, Light-Widening Eye like that the clockmaker had once proposed, and the Guild had rejected). The populace looked instead to the towers where the jasmine-hawks dozed and the Palace Aster peacocks preened themselves ghost-bright on the patterned tiles; their hands tightened on the tools of their many ill-paid, bloodied trades, and their eyes grew keen.', '\\xa0', 'Meanwhile, Excelsior’s dulling nib and clotting ink scraped on, as if they could abrade the imagined offence.', 'But when Excelsior next burned his coppers, the phantom, slippery as a cough, refused the commission. The Nightingale had gone too far away. Even if Excelsior had set fire to pearls and gold—even had the reluctant ghost known beyond rumour what they were—it was too thin to waft the distance to the Palace Aster unaided, let alone freighted with music.', 'The banks the Nightingale’s voice had carved in Excelsior’s soul grew dry and the riverbed parched, weeds of ditties rank where willows of song had trailed.', 'Even the customary rattle and beat of Owl Abbas had grown sick and strident. The overwound springs of cart and boat shrieked, the middens steamed and smouldered.', 'A fever found its way into Excelsior. He could not rest. The ink dried, but he scribbled on in oil and soot; the nibs broke, and he scraped out staves with wire and nail; the paper slid from his table, the copper lay neglected on the floor and the music went to seed, etched on board and beam, glass and door.', 'The Phantom of the Window-sash watched, dispassionate. This would pass, and if it did not, then this scribbler would die and another take his place. Madness took scribblers just as falling took pigeon-gatherers, as cogs took mill-workers, and time took phantoms.', '\\xa0', 'Once a simple temple in a grove, the Palace Aster had grown decadent and cancerous over grass and tree, over its own simpler stylings, over even the first streets of Owl Abbas.', 'Through gates and corridors, ballrooms that had been market squares and parlours that had been common greens, where silk and wax flowers hung now in silver baskets from gilded gallows, the Nightingale was led.', 'The faint messenger-spirit was wise, thought the Nightingale. This, and not the citizenry, was what the Nightingale had been designed to capture.', 'Through corridors the walls of which were lined with facades of plundered houses, under arched roofs painted like forgotten skies, the voicehounds brought their quarry, and handed the Nightingale over to the nobles.', 'They brought the Nightingale to the heights of the Palace Aster—galleries and balconies, lace bridges, the roof-walks where the denizens of the Imperial Aviary strutted and fluttered to the accompaniment of flautists imported to teach them better musicality.', 'Into a chamber scrubbed clean of its last inhabitant the Nightingale was taken, and there washed and oiled, polished and gowned, clad in velvet the colour of the mountains, the tint of the light that had burned in the little room above Petty Street.', '“We have found the voice you sought,” the courtiers told the Little Emperor, while the voicehounds, ignored, circled and grumbled among themselves, gnawing out their bitterness in the words they’d heard sung in the streets.', 'The finest composers (brought long since to the Palace Aster and left to languish in corners and gardens) were discomposed and discommoded, divested of sheets of chorales and anthems.', 'These were finished, polished things, every nuance of voice directed, and for all the Nightingale’s powers the music had the staid elegance that Excelsior’s lacked.', 'But only the voicehounds noticed anything amiss. The Little Emperor was already bored.', '\\xa0', 'Lust and love and loss; hopeless naïveté and ground-down wisdom; soot-etched, fire-branded, blade-cut, wheel-crushed, ill-rested, underfed. Thus the merry folk of Owl Abbas.', 'To them, the high, dying falls, the heart-cries Excelsior had intended for the Nightingale, took new meaning. This is what the songs proclaimed: the lily-towers, the jasmine-hawks, the Little Emperor and the Palace Aster must, should, ', ' fall.', 'Excelsior, racked by sickness, heard voices raised in Petty Street. It was music, he realised, of a sort. A passion greater than that of youth, more violent than that of love.', 'I could write for this, he thought, tracing twitching marks in the dust of his garret floor, barely alarming the little spiders that had begun to blanket him.', 'Excelsior, so poorly fitted to be a revolutionary, such an unwitting conductor of dissent, tapped on the floor a martial drumbeat that only the Phantom of the Window-sash, frowning, felt. If a musical affair high above the streets might have disturbed the rooftop dwellers, a burning of roofs—whether in a fit of revolutionary enthusiasm or political retribution—was infinitely more to be deplored.', 'The ghost was dimly aware that this, after untold years and hauntings, might be its end: sifting as ash down on broken spring-carts. That this was likely also to be Excelsior’s end did not overly concern it.', 'But oh, this had been too great a mischief.', 'Having mustered a faint discontent, it slipped out by the window and wafted over the greasy canals, through slums and barricades, borne on the breath and voices of marchers, lifted by the songs of bakers (their long, heat-hardened bread-boards carved to spears), tossed by the shouts of dungmen redolent with ire.', 'Through gardenia paths waxen with bodies and over palisades spiked with sabres, it drifted into the Palace Aster. It blew like the dust of cobwebs among marvels and mosaics, unmoved by the unmaking of wonders.', 'Withering, it thought at last of the view from the room in Petty Street, and of the high widowing-walks of the palace, where one might see a mountain glowing red as a lantern.', 'Finer than thistledown, the phantom tumbled in the currents of bonfire-warmed air up the twisting stairs, and sighed, finally, against the finely turned ankles of the silent Nightingale.', 'Set free to haunt the Palace Aster with every other creature, curiosity and concubine marked with the Imperial seal, fragmenting its talent in the mirrored arcades of the Palace Aster, the Nightingale knew nothing of revolution.', 'It had been sent to win the heart of Owl Abbas. First, yearning back to its maker’s mountains, the Nightingale had believed itself shaped merely to capture that heart with beauty.', 'Then the singer had thought itself to be kidnapper and assassin, but here it had reached the centre and found nothing to bear away. The Little Emperor was merely a man, and could contain the city-state only by letting it slip endlessly through his hands. An ear and heart so lightly lifted were as easy to grasp as smoke. Ringed as they were by flame and riot, they would soon become smoke in truth.', 'Now, the Nightingale lifted its visitor like a snowflake, save that a snowflake would not have melted moment by moment on the cold brass of the singer’s palm.', '“Strange spirit,” said the Nightingale, tuneless. “My maker-mistress sent me to bring back the heart of Owl Abbas. But it is too vast for me to carry, and too bright. See how the walls shine, like my lantern.”', 'The voice that had never before spoken without singing scraped the Phantom’s being like steel on porcelain. It writhed a little, weakly.', '“I listened to you once, and here I am,” said the Nightingale. “I will not say you led me astray. It was I who was not adequate to my task. Am I to follow you again?”', 'They left the Palace Aster of the heights and followed the groaning of draughts through tower and tunnel. They departed the halls and salons where mirrors splintered and paintings bubbled, and crept into the lowest palace, that composed of cellars and basements, new and old and ancient, and each filled with the surfeit of every beauty, every luxury, every excess, and somewhere—who knows?—the dusty reliquary that contained the bones of the last idle owl.', '“Perhaps the heart is here,” said the Nightingale. But there was riot and looting overhead, and no time to search those unnumbered cells and dungeons.', 'Through storeroom and oubliette, sewer and gutter they hastened, phantom and Nightingale. They slipped past the guards, the crowds, they elbowed through mob and melee. Buildings burned around them, the cobbleskulls ascended in bone-smoke while spirit-lamps, bursting, gave up their ghosts. Once only they paused, on the street of guildhalls, to take the great signet of the Elevated Guild of Horologists and Artificers from the rubble. Then they hastened on.', 'Fire melted the Little Emperor’s seal on the Nightingale’s shoulder, and wisped shreds from the phantom like steam. And as they fled, they heard, beaten into blunt weapons, into anthems and banners, the songs of Excelsior.', '\\xa0', 'Excelsior did not know what he had wrought.', ', he thought. ', '. But he had none left. The ink in its well had dried to dust, the nibs rusted on the floor, spiders spun in his hair. ', ', he thought. ', '. For all the fire below, he saw frost in the window, curling from the webs he had etched there in his first passionate shyness.', ', he thought. ', '. He did not even have strength, now, to burn them for the faithless ghost as a last legacy.', 'The door latch lifted, and a creature walked in.', 'The Nightingale’s palace robes had been eaten away by spark and flame, threads of precious metals imparting the briefest of strength to the Phantom of the Window-sash, which clung still around the throat of silver and mahogany pipes.', 'The bonfire light danced like drums through the Nightingale’s hollow cage of ribs, the sliding sheets of ebony and quartz that shielded bellows and bells.', 'The Nightingale looked about the garret, read singingly the ravings etched into bench and board.', '“This is the hand that wrote the songs you brought me, strange spirit,” said the Nightingale. “Yet these are the words the people with torches sang, all through the streets. I heard these in the idle-rooms of the Palace, and this in the tearooms past which the voicehounds brought me. You led me a dance, spirit, but perhaps this is the room on which Owl Abbas now centres, after all, and I shall have earned the signet seal we took.”', 'Kneeling with a beautiful spinning of weights and wires, the Nightingale peered at Excelsior and said, “It cannot live longer, I see, as people live. Can it live as you?”', 'The phantom undulated impolitely.', '“No,” agreed the Nightingale, without reproach. “I see it lives as you do even now. Wishing nothing to change, wishing power beyond what it was built for.”', 'The long decorative fingers, designed to accompany music and elaborate a beat upon the air, now probed the skull, the throat, the diminishing softnesses that still enclosed Excelsior.', '“How does one get in?” the Nightingale asked the phantom. “How were you drawn out of your shell?”', 'It could not answer the question, even if it had cared to. Hatred, love, unstretched wings, habit? They had all eroded so long ago.', 'The Nightingale calculated. It had never had cause to be fitted with the knowledge of where ghosts come from. They infested the city in much the way of the seasonal senates of ash-pigeons and the sub-kingdom of rats, but now all the nests and roosts were in disarray. The city was rearranging itself, and who knew what would pour into its new emptinesses, as a singer stretches the air to let the listener’s heart fall in.', '“Ah, that at least I have done before,” the Nightingale said. “It is all I have ever done.”', 'Among the broken nibs, the slivered coins, the fraying quills, the Nightingale sought fragments that would fit its need: glass shards and a penknife not entirely rusted.', '“You will understand,” the Nightingale said to Excelsior. “There is fire below the stairs. Owl Abbas is shedding all that was. So, too, are you. But like a clock I must hasten time a little.”', '“Are you death?” murmured Excelsior. “I thought death would be an old thing. But for all the soot on you, you shine.”', '“You know me, songwriter,” said the Nightingale. “Listen, and hurry.”', '“I cannot move,” said Excelsior. “What can I do?”', '“You will understand, and know the urgency,” said the Nightingale.', 'Carefully, counting its own seconds, the Nightingale unpicked the lock in its own breast, and opened first the cage of its ribs, and then the cabinet its master had installed there. It drew out the little drawer, cushioned in velvet. And as it did so, the Nightingale sang.', 'It was only a slight essay in scales, simple and hampered by the smoke in the bellows, the discord in a wire that had been jangled in the crowds.', '“I know that music,” sighed Excelsior, and his fingers wandered over the dust of the floor. “I had meant to write such songs for you as would spill the city over with meaning, and pull hearts from their moorings.”', '“You did,” said the Nightingale. “Now, I must unmoor your heart.”', '“You already have,” Excelsior began to say, with no more volume than the watching ghost. But the Nightingale parted his ragged shirt and with careful, unshaking hands opened flesh and muscle and bone. How little blood, and how thick, spilled on the floor. Not enough to save even a small phantom, though it chased several even older wisps, of the sort that flutter in the dust about bedposts, away.', '“Your heart alone would fulfill my errand,” said the Nightingale, lifting out that flinching organ, “but we might make something new entire, you and I: a thing I was not built to invent and you would not live to try. What my maker will make of that, I do not know.”', 'To the third member of their company it said, “Will you show him how to ', ' as you? For he must learn quickly.”', 'The Phantom of the Window-sash, however, had no interest in further expiating its sins against Excelsior. It rumpled itself to the sill and floated in the air above the fires, breathing for the deaths of coins, ascending to the garrets-above-the-garrets, to bother pigeon-parliaments and rat-scouts a little longer, before it vanished altogether from sight.', 'The Nightingale stowed Excelsior’s gory heart and gathered up the trailing threads of his horrified, bewildered spirit, tucking them neatly in place amidst the staining velvet that it had once, mistakenly, intended for the heart of the Little Emperor.', 'Then the Nightingale latched closed the cabinet of its chest. “There,” it said, patting the metal and the panels of quartz and beaten horn. “Rest a little. I shall carry us for now.”', '\\xa0', 'In time, new scribblers would arise from the ashes, as would a new city and a new emperor, of whatever stature, to take the place of the one who (it would be said) had lain in state, arms full of treasures, while the Palace Aster blossomed into flame.', 'But for now, the city rioted and burned, and neither then nor later did it know or care that the author of its rebellion was carried out of its bounds, rocked within the ribs of the Nightingale.', '“I shall learn to write songs through you,” murmured the Nightingale to its little burden, as it strode out of the city gates in the shining night, and between the blue fields at dawn, “and you shall grow to sing them through me.”', 'They reached the foothills in a glowing afternoon, where the leaves flamed copper. And it was in an evening that, singing softly a song entirely new, they climbed into the scarlet haze of the mountains and vanished at last from the history of Owl Abbas.', 'Copyright © 2018 by Kathleen Jennings', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Audrey Benjaminsen']}\n"

A slyly funny, raucous adventure in the alternate America of Sarah Gailey’s ', ' and ', '.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'Winslow Remington Houndstooth had a problem.', 'The problem was Ruby.', 'She wouldn’t get up. She was lying there with her head in the mud and making the most piteous noises Houndstooth had ever heard, and she simply wouldn’t ', '.', 'This was an especially bad problem for three reasons.', 'Ruby was a hippopotamus, and when a hippopotamus doesn’t want to get up, there is not a soul alive or dead in the great green state of Georgia who can make her get up. Winslow Remington Houndstooth, by his own account (and perhaps one or two others), was the greatest hopper in the South or anywhere else. But not even he could make a hippopotamus get up and go without her express permission.', 'Houndstooth was not a hippopotamus, and therefore he was not equipped to run faster and farther than the men who would soon be chasing him. He was a very fit man—any number of conquests scattered in his wake could have attested to that—but he was not fit enough to run fast and far while carrying a Bellerman High-Quality No-Lock Ultrafine Safe’s worth of gold ingots in a large sack over his shoulder.', 'Ruby didn’t care about reasons.', 'The hippo looked at Houndstooth with one doleful eye. She was hip-deep in the wallow outside Barley McMorrow’s mansion. Her head rested on the edge of the wallow, and she wouldn’t budge. She usually responded to his presence by heaving herself upright, and if that didn’t work, the phrase “let’s go” was always more than enough to get her going—but not this time. She’d been put and she intended to stay that way.', '“C’mon, Roo,” Houndstooth murmured, stroking her nose with one blood-spattered hand. “Get up for me. We have to go.”', 'Ruby didn’t shift.', '“Ruby,” Houndstooth repeated, giving the hippo a sharp tap between the nostrils. “We’ve got to ', '.”', 'Ruby didn’t blink.', '“Bloody stubborn—', '!” Houndstooth shouted into Ruby’s face as loudly as he dared.', 'Ruby did not care for shouting.', 'In response, she opened her mouth and let out what was, for her, a soft groan. The bellow roused the attention of the sleeping guard on the front porch of McMorrow’s mansion.', '“Hello down there,” the guard shouted, taking a few steps toward the wallow. “Help you?”', 'Houndstooth glared at Ruby. “We’re just fine,” he called up casually, trying to spread some Georgia over his Blackpool accent. “My girl here took a fancy to y’all’s waller, and I can’t make ’er git.”', 'The guard hesitated, staring at the two of them. Houndstooth cursed himself—his accents were never accurate, and he was certain that he’d put too much Tennessee into his voice.', '“Is that a Cambridge Black?”', '“Fuck me twice in a row,” Houndstooth spat under his breath. Then, a little louder: “Oh, no, of course not—she’s just got into that there dark clay, is all. Real slob, this’n.” ', ' he thought, ', 'But the guard came closer, stepping down onto the broad green lawn that stretched between Ruby’s wallow and the mansion. “I’m nearly sure—I saw a Cambridge Black when I was just a pup, and she looks just like one! I thought they all died when that fire—”', 'Houndstooth didn’t listen any further than that. He didn’t need to.', 'He’d been made.', '“Ruby,” he whispered, “you need to get up ', ' love, or we’ll both be lake bacon.” With one hand, he loosed the leather straps that sheathed his two best knives; with the other, he tightened his grip on the sack of gold. Ruby gave him another grumble, her mouth gaping. Houndstooth dropped his sack into her saddlebag, the sound of ten thousand dollars in gold making a satisfying ', ' against the leather. He used his free hand to press on Ruby’s nose, trying to make her close her mouth. “You’r’nt gonna want to come too much closer, now,” he drawled loudly at the approaching guard. “She done went and got herself a bad case of hop-mites.”', 'There was a noise from inside—shouts. ', 'Houndstooth thought, ', ' He thought he’d hidden them better than that, but he couldn’t have accounted for ', 'the blood trails.', 'The guard hesitated. “Where are you from, friend?” he asked, and Houndstooth laughed.', '“Oh, here and there,” he said. He laughed again, trying to cover the growing shouts of alarm coming from inside of the mansion—but the guard went very still. As Houndstooth watched, the man’s gaze turned from him to Ruby, and back again.', 'Then, the guard turned tail and ran back up to the house, kicking up divots of grass behind him.', '\\xa0', '“You gull-blighted beast,” Houndstooth hissed at Ruby. “Get up, we have to go, ', '!” There was no question, none at all, that the guard had figured out who he was looking at. Winslow Remington Houndstooth, creator of the best and rarest breed of hippo in the United States of America, notorious outlaw, handsomest heartbreaker in the American South—', 'Ruby bellowed, opening her jaws to their full 180-degree breadth.', 'She left her mouth open wide.', 'Houndstooth reached up to try to grab her nose and yank it down, but she pulled her entire head up at the last second and his hand landed on one of her long, curving lower tusks. She bellowed again, and this time, Houndstooth looked.', '“Oh, no,” he said softly. “Oh, Ruby, ', '.”', '\\xa0', 'Ruby had a lot of teeth.', 'Being a Cambridge Black meant that she was different from other hippos in many ways. She was sleek—not thin by any stretch of the imagination, but more bullet-shaped than her peers. She was black as night, black as ink, black as a shadow. She was quiet when she wanted to be. She was faster than a secret spreading through a church picnic.', 'But her teeth were hippo teeth, plain and simple. She had the requisite number of molars to back up her bite, which was more than strong enough to turn a man’s femur to pulp. She had eight incisors, two long and two short on the top and bottom of her mouth. The long ones jutted forward like extended swords: her fighting incisors.', 'All of these were in excellent condition. Houndstooth, like any hopper worth his resin, brushed and polished all of Ruby’s ivory once a week whether she needed it or not. Her teeth gleamed white in the Atlanta sun, immaculate. Perfect.', 'Except for two.', 'Her tusks—the long, curving sabers that arced up out of her lower jaw to boldly dare anyone, man or bull, to come near her with anything less than an attitude of worship—were cracked.', '“Ruby, no,” Houndstooth repeated, gingerly running his hands along her lower tusks. A meandering gray line ran up the length of each one. “How did this happen?”', 'Ruby slowly, finally closed her mouth. She looked at Houndstooth and flipped an ear back and forth.', '“Okay,” Houndstooth said. “Okay, I see. I know it hurts, Roo.” He stroked her nose as gently as he could. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the doors of McMorrow’s mansion fly open. Men flew down the steps of the veranda and onto the lawn, drawing pistols to aim at Ruby and Houndstooth. “Roo, love, if you can just manage for one more day,” he cooed into her ear. “Just one more day, and I’ll take you to see Dr. Bantou. We’ll get you fixed up, sweet.”', 'Ruby sighed heavily. Then, the enormous midnight bulk of her shifted, and she began to rise.', 'Houndstooth reached up as she was standing, wrapping his hand around the pommel of the kneeling saddle that was strapped to her back by a harness of mesh and webbing. He held his gray Stetson onto his head with his free hand and flung himself up into the saddle. The moment his knees met leather, he whipped his hat off and used it to slap Ruby’s behind with just enough force for her to flick her tail at him. She took off like a cannonball, and before McMorrow’s men could get a shot fired, Ruby and Houndstooth had disappeared into the waters of the Peachtree Lagoon.', '\\xa0', 'Ruby loved Dr. Bantou with a passion, and Dr. Bantou loved her right back.', 'Houndstooth and the doctor had a slightly different relationship.', '“Mite-bitten huckster,” Houndstooth muttered under his breath.', '“What has this cruel, neglectful man been doing to you?” Dr. Bantou crooned into Ruby’s open mouth. He tucked a large, glistening bunch of grapes into Ruby’s cheek as he gripped each of her molars in turn, looking for a loose tooth to yell at Houndstooth about.', 'Houndstooth drew himself up with a lofty indignance that would have made his mother deeply proud. “I have been doing ', ' what you told me to do the last time you extorted me for a fortune,” he sniffed. “Anything that’s wrong with her is your fault, I shouldn’t doubt.”', 'Dr. Bantou showed absolutely no sign of having heard a word Houndstooth said. He squeezed a melon slice over Ruby’s gullet, then ran his juice-soaked hands over her gums and tongue. “And I’ll wager he hasn’t been feeding you enough, either,” Dr. Bantou said conspiratorially. Ruby made a pleased noise in the back of her vast throat, and Dr. Bantou chuckled, dropping a pomelo onto her tongue. He withdrew himself from within biting distance and patted Ruby’s nose. She immediately dropped her teeth shut with a ', ' sending various fruit juices spattering across Dr. Bantou’s long leather apron.', '“Well,” Dr. Bantou said, turning around and wiping his hands across his front. “She’s in acceptable condition, other than the cracked tusks.”', '“I know that,” Houndstooth snapped. “I take damned excellent care of her.”', 'Dr. Bantou raised an eyebrow. “So excellent that you didn’t notice those tusks for . . . what, a week?”', 'Houndstooth didn’t mean to lose eye contact with the dentist, but he did. Just for a second. It was enough.', '“Mmm, that’s what I thought,” Bantou drawled.', '“I was on a job,” Houndstooth snapped. “I was helping a friend to whom I owed a favor and my honor—something I’m sure you’d know nothing about.”', '“Well, whatever you were doing, you left her someplace too small and too boring,” Bantou said. “She’s been biting at boulders. Did you put her in a quarry somewhere? By herself, I gather?” Houndstooth clenched his jaw. Dr. Bantou’s face remained placid. When he spoke, his voice carried the authority of a man who has had the upper hand all along. “They’re bad, Houndstooth. I’ll need to pull them out.”', 'Houndstooth felt all of the blood drain from his face. “No,” he breathed. “No, you can’t. There must be some other way. Ruby’s tusks, they’re—they’re her pride and joy, Bantou.” He knew he sounded like a lunatic, but it was true. When Ruby basked with her mouth wide, the sun glinting off her beautiful white tusks, every other hippo that saw her would dip its nose below the surface of the water. Her tusks were beautiful, strong, fearsome. “What are our other options?”', 'Bantou clicked his tongue. “You won’t like it,” he said. “Better to just pull them out.”', '“What’s the other option?” Houndstooth asked. His heart was racing. He kept looking at Ruby, who was merrily crunching on a watermelon. He tried to imagine her without her tusks, and tears welled up in his eyes.', '“You won’t like it,” Dr. Bantou repeated. A broad grin spread across his face. “You won’t like it at all.”', '“Let me guess,” Houndstooth said. “It’ll cost me?”', '“Oh, yes.” Bantou was still smiling. “And then some.”', '“How much?” Houndstooth asked.', 'Bantou’s smile slid into a frown that was thoughtful, but no less smug. “Do you know, it’s the strangest thing,” he said. He studied his cuticles. “I heard a rumor this morning.”', '“How much will it cost me, you hop-shitted hunk of swamp grease?” Houndstooth spat. Bantou didn’t flinch.', '“It was the most curious rumor about a theft,” he said. “Barley McMorrow’s estate, I think it was. Have you ever heard of it?”', 'In the water, Ruby grumbled in pain. Houndstooth pinched the bridge of his nose. “I see.”', '“Yes,” said Dr. Bantou, his smile returning. “I’d imagine you do.”', '\\xa0', 'Four days later, Houndstooth returned to pick up Ruby from Dr. Bantou’s infirmary. The infirmary was a broad loop of marsh, divided into individual paddocks to prevent recovering hippos from taking out their discomfort on one another.', 'Bantou wasted no time with insincere pleasantries. “She’s doing very well,” he assured Houndstooth the moment he approached the marsh. “The procedure went entirely according to plan. As routine as can be.”', '“Where is she?” Houndstooth demanded.', '“I’ll have my payment first, thank you,” Dr. Bantou replied, stretching out a languid arm and opening his palm expectantly.', 'Grumbling, Houndstooth fished around in the sack he was carrying. It was a large sack—too large by far for its contents. Houndstooth had to reach his entire arm into the sack before his hand wrapped around his quarry.', 'He withdrew a single gold ingot from the sack and clutched it tight. “Haven’t you taken enough already?” he asked. Bantou didn’t respond—he simply kept his hand out and steady. After a long, tense minute, Houndstooth dropped the ingot into Bantou’s palm.', '“Thank you,” Bantou said with a cold smile. Then he let out a sharp whistle, and Ruby rose smoothly out of the water directly in front of them both. “Ruby, my lovely girl,” he cooed, withdrawing an apple from his pocket, “show Mr. Houndstooth what we’ve done.”', 'She opened her mouth for the apple, revealing her restored tusks. Houndstooth gasped involuntarily.', '“They’re beautiful,” he murmured in spite of himself.', '“I know,” Bantou said, running a hand over his work. It was true—they were beautiful. Bantou had filled the cracks in her tusks using a fine cement, his own recipe. Then, to protect them, he’d affixed to each tusk a thin, supple sheath of pure, polished gold.', 'It had taken a lot of gold to do the job, though.', 'Almost the entirety of one Bellerman High-Quality No-Lock Ultrafine Safe’s worth, to be precise.', '“It’s my finest work, for my favorite patient,” Bantou said, smiling at Ruby. When he smiled at her, he was almost handsome, Houndstooth thought. The thought evaporated when Bantou turned to glare at him. “While I was working on her, I noticed something else,” Bantou said. “You’ve been neglecting her flossing.”', 'Houndstooth let his fingers play across the hilt of one of his knives as the dentist lectured him about tartar buildup. But then he looked back at Ruby, who was happier than he’d seen her in months, and he sighed. He settled in to listen to the dentist prattle on about Ruby’s gums. ', ' he thought. ', 'In the water, Ruby let her mouth hang open, the sun glinting off her new tusks. A tiny marsh bird landed between her fighting incisors, inspecting her mouth for morsels it might enjoy. It pecked once at her tongue, and Houndstooth caught a familiar glint in his old friend’s eye.', 'Before the bird could notice its own reflection in the polished gold of her tusks, Ruby’s teeth snapped shut. Bantou startled—his foot slipped on the muddy edge of the paddock, and he only just caught himself in time to keep from falling into the cloudy water. As he yanked his leg up out of the muck, cursing his ruined boot, a single white feather floated down to land on the brim of his hat.', 'Houndstooth smiled. She’d been worth every ingot.', 'Copyright © 2018 by Sarah Gailey', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Goñi Montes']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Angel of the Blockade'], 'Author': ['Alex Wells'], 'Body': ['Nata spends her time zipping through the black in her ugly yet bad-ass spaceship, taking pride in being the best smuggler the Imperial regime has never caught. When she takes on an expensive mystery cargo, however, the risk reaches far beyond her pride.', '“You’re a cheap asshole,” I call to Bara as I cross the threshold of the bar. I don’t have to wait for my Traveler to give me a rundown to know they’re there. Bara’s always there. Bara doesn’t sleep, shit, or fuck as far as I know.', 'The bar smells like old socks, sour beer, and just an edge of mustiness, which means the air filters are probably a couple weeks past due. Starting to go moldy, but not bad enough to actually give anyone a respiratory infection. It almost overwhelms the weird, dirty cinnamon scent that characterizes Corona Nine Station and never leaves the back of your throat once you’ve sucked in your first lungful.', '“And you’re a sleazy shitbag,” Bara returns calmly. Their ident chip reads off to my Traveler as human, their voice—not too high, not too low—sounds like they’re speaking through a metal tube, and what those things add up to isn’t any of my fucking business. I like Bara, and Bara likes me, and that’s all that matters. “Business or boredom?”', '“Business today.”', '“Okay. Business drink coming right up. Your table’s free.”', '“I know.” In that brief time, my Traveler’s finished flitting around for a quick survey and clicks out the locations of everything in the bar to the little implant in my jawbone. Nothing and no one interesting, in its opinion. My normal place in the right mid where I won’t have to dodge too many outstretched legs and cocked elbows is clear. Probably because in station time, it’s just about breakfast, and so-called normal people have this thing about not drinking their morning carbohydrates mixed with alcohol in a shitty hole in the wall where your feet stick to the floor.', 'People like me? We live on our own time.', 'I move among the tables and the few patrons (human, human, human, most of them identifiable as smugglers or black marketeers because their ident chips roll off with that particular flat note that indicates knock-offs just expensive enough to dodge cursory security checkpoints) and then slide into my chair with as much grace as anyone can under 0.5 g.', 'Fuck gravity, I hate it. Makes my teeth ache.', ' of footsteps (Bara probably weighs about 120 kilos) and then the solid click of a sipper cup being set down. I rest my elbow casually on the table, which is a mistake because it’s also sticky. “Did you fire your server again?”', '“Nah, he left. Wanted to join the army. Can’t remember which one.” In their tone, I hear the shrug that puts the period on that statement.', '“Guess they pay better than you.”', '“Haven’t had a server get shot in years.”', 'My Traveler, now settled in its customary spot somewhere over my right shoulder, guides my hand with subtle pressure behind my ear so I pick up the cup with no fumbling. Me and my Traveler have been together a long time. We’ve learned each other. I raise the cup in the direction of Bara’s voice in a little salute. “Money isn’t everything—”', 'Bara finishes the saying with me: “—Cause you can’t gamble it when you’re dead.” They laugh. “Who you waiting for?”', '“New one. Haddan?” The question is implicit—', '“Doesn’t frequent the underbelly,” Bara says. “And sleaze is thin on the ground. Imperial patrols have been picking up a lot lately. Getting intense.”', '“Think we’re in line for a raid?” Unheard of. Corona Nine was in the armpit of the Empire. That’s why I liked it.', '“Finished unloading all your cargo?”', '“Think about who you’re talking to here.”', '“Then you’ll be fine. Anyway, I’ll see what blows in that looks like it might piss itself and send it your way.”', '“Try not to scare off my meal ticket.”', 'Bara snorts. “If they can’t handle me, they sure as hell won’t be able to handle you, Nata.” They pat me on the shoulder and then walk away.', 'It’s an exaggeration. Of all Bara’s clientele, I’m the least likely to take a knife to someone. I’ve never liked fighting, never saw the point to it. Sure, I carry a vibraknife; one cut to the back of the hand and it’ll make anyone let go. But I learned at my auntie’s knee, there’s no point in having ballads sung about you if you’re not alive to hear them. I slouch down into my chair and take my time drinking while my Traveler ticks off minutes for me. I’m good enough that I get to be picky about the cargo I take, and I don’t put up with people being late, not when they expect me to be on time.', 'I’m just about to finish my drink and skip out when someone whose pace I don’t recognize walks up behind me. My Traveler reads the ident as Shev Haddan, and of course it’s got the same flat, sour note of every other ident here. Fake. Real ones are downright harmonious. “Nata?”', 'I don’t turn my head. It’s pointless, I can hear him just fine. “You’re late. Sit.”', '“Sorry, I—”', '“I don’t care. Sit,” I repeat.', 'Wonder of wonders, he does. And proceeds to fidget, all rustling clothing and the dull sound of one fingernail picking at another. One of those. Normally they wait until later in the conversation, when the fact that I’m not actually looking at them starts really getting on their nerves. “You came highly recommended,” he says.', 'I love it when they start with flattery. “You said you wanted a fast run. I’m the fastest. What’s the mass on your cargo, and where do you want me to take it?”', '“Mass is 2,800 kilos. In-atmosphere haul; it’s delicate electronics. Going to Iota Dover Station.”', 'That’s three jumps out, but a straight enough shot in the backgates. The mass barely registers, comforting since it means he’s not having me smuggle ordnance for some guerilla group. And most important, it doesn’t require crossing the Seventh Satrapy blockade. War is mostly great news for people like me; all markets get smudged gray. But it also gives us a whole new array of people we really want to avoid, people who have a lot more guns and a lot more free time than us. I’ve been making my calories easy running contraband between Imperial systems and ignoring the civil war. I have no interest in changing that now.', 'I name a price, two times bigger than fucking ridiculous.', '“Done,” he says, tone final. I hear him rustle into motion, then my Traveler informs me that Haddan’s got his hand out to shake.', 'He agreed too fast. Something has to be wrong. He can’t be that naïve or stupid. But the payday. The fucking payday. When you’re a smuggler, it’s all about the payday. “Cash up front,” I say, not making a move. I won’t be played. “One hundred percent.”', '“How do I know you’re not going to run?” he asks, the enthusiasm finally gone.', 'I like knowing I’m not the only one feeling paranoid. “Go ask your friends around the station, if you have any. My reputation is solid.” It is. I’ve never welshed on a deal. Might have dropped cargo a time or two, but I refund the payment when that happens. I like my contracts clean, my work simple, and my head still attached to my neck—it’s more valuable that way.', 'But the bigger point is the one we both know. He doesn’t have friends on this station. I can smell the downsider on him, the cheap freshener he’s doused his clothes with because he can’t handle the permanent acrid body odor stink of budget station accommodations. And when he walked up, he sure as hell didn’t sound like someone who knew low-g or no-g. We space-born rats aren’t goddamn dancing unicorns, but we don’t shuffle every step. He’s pure dirt sucker.', '“You came highly recommended,” he mutters.', '“I sure did. And if you want reliable, and you want speed, you fucking give me what I want.”', 'He’s sticking his hand out again, my Traveler informs me, now amused. And I can hear Haddan huffing his displeasure. Taps of pressure like a maneuvering jet guide me in smoothly for a handclasp, and the deal is done. I’m nice enough about his ego that I don’t quite smirk. “Deliver your cargo to berth 257. Sooner you get it to me, sooner I can run it out.”', '“I’ve been by that berth,” he says. Checking up, maybe. Doing a little research. Not a complete moron. “Ugliest ship I’ve ever seen.”', 'I give his hand a vicious squeeze before I let go, smiling all the while. “You paid for fast. You didn’t pay for pretty.”', '\\xa0', 'My ship’s been voted ugliest on Corona Nine Station ten years running. Her name is ', ', after my parents and my auntie, the way my auntie named me after ', ' auntie, Chrysanthemum. No one but her calls me Chrysanthemum—to everyone else I’m just Nata, because I didn’t want anyone getting weird botanical ideas. I don’t know what the ', ' looks like, and I don’t care. She’s my elephant: Each of her parts feels random, unrelated, and adds up magically to ', '. All that matters is that I can weave them together into a set of wings so we fly across the void, faster than anyone else.', 'I’m waiting with her when the dockworkers show up with the shipment: 2,800 kilos, packed in a lot of weirdly big boxes. I skate my fingers over the smooth, unremarkable shipping containers to get a handle on their size and where they are in the hold, and note the raised maker marks have been filed off, but that’s normal in my line of work. My Traveler sniffs them over for flagged biologicals and radiation sources and quietly murmurs the ', ' result through my jawbone, but beyond that, it isn’t any of my business. For all I know, I’m running the most expensive empty boxes in the system. Plausible deniability is a shield I’m not too proud to use. Saved my ass on more than one occasion, playing the confused and naïve woman who’s just trying to save up for an operation.', 'Cargo gets one final count; I check all the netting and sign off \\xa0for Karis\\xa0-dee, the dock boss. She knows me well enough that she slaps me on the shoulder on the way out. “See you in a week, Nata.”', '“And I won’t see you, Kay-dee.” The cargo doors closing cut off her silvery laugh, the send-off \\xa0I’ve gotten at Corona Nine for the last year and a half. I wish I could bottle up that laugh, roll around in it, feel it flutter against my throat. Maybe next time. Maybe I’ll set aside some money and get her a present. (I never do. All my love tokens go to the ', '.)', 'I slide my fingers along the bulkhead until I find the lighting control. The front panel is already missing, since I didn’t think there was a point to having multiple lighting settings. Full on or full off covers the bases, since I only use the lights for the dock loaders. I pull out the thumb-sized control pack—they last slightly longer if you take them out of the circuit since they don’t get hit with the tiny power plant variations that occur during flight—and stick it in one of my thigh pockets. I learned how to pinch credits on Auntie’s knee, and it’s not like I or the cargo need the light. That power’s better off diverted to the engines.', 'I keep my fingers on the wall as I take the short passage, head ducked precisely \\xa0because I’m too damn tall to be in a ship under gravity, up to the bridge. It’s like running my fingers along the arching back of a happy cat. I slide into the waiting couch, worn and grooved to match every muscle of my back, ass, and legs, and trigger the sensory feedback links for the skinsuit I always keep under my regular clothes. I pull the ', ' on like a second skin. The power plant hums its readiness, a vibration that I feel in my gut. My Traveler nudges the onboard dumb AI out of sleep mode with the kind of fondness you get from someone waking up a pet. As the AI handshakes with the smart station system and Corona Nine spins us off into space, I find the sensor pad and pin it between my front teeth. I taste the wash \\xa0of Corona’s solar wind like curls of orange peel on my tongue.', '“Station course accepted. Exiting local control zone in eleven minutes, thirty-six seconds,” the onboard AI informs me in a genderless voice. I settle in against my safety netting as gravity finally fucks off, and absorb location tones, taste washes \\xa0of mild radiation that splash across the ship’s skin—now ', ' skin. The shift and hum of maneuvering jets and steadily warming impulse engines echo through my fingers and palms.', 'And eleven minutes, thirty-six seconds later, I stretch my wings and fly.', '\\xa0', 'Five hours out from the rickety backgate that’ll take us from Corona to Tauric as long as it hasn’t fucking fallen apart, and I’m relaxed into a border-smudging ooze with my ship. Like a nap, but better. That’s when I feel the air in the cabin shift—impossible—and catch an acidic whiff of synth strawberry flavor—fucking ', ', I can’t stand that shit. I rip my arm free and go for the knife on my belt as I feel a shiver of heat cross my face, a hand light maybe. And then the couch shakes as someone grabs hold and something cold, broad, and metal presses against the top of my head. It takes my fumbling brain about two seconds to recognize the metal barrel’s the right size to be a neuroscrambler. I freeze.', 'I very carefully release the hilt of my utility knife and raise my hands, fingers spread. I’d rather not startle anyone. That I can move, and think, and cuss myself out means they haven’t pulled the trigger yet. I just need whoever it is on the other end of the scrambler to realize they can’t afford to turn my axons into an unrecognizable knot. The way I can feel the scrambler trembling doesn’t give me a whole lot of comfort, but—', '“What the fuck?” a woman says. She’s not the one with the gun; she’s in front of me, and there’s her leg brushing against mine. “What the fuck did you do to the control panels?”', 'Oh, there we go. I grin, hands still held out, and spit the sensor pad out to swing on its tether in front of me. “You dumb assholes picked the wrong ship to try to jack.” Lights and pretty visual display panels? Waste of power that could go to the engines instead. First thing I scrapped the day Auntie loaned me the money to buy the ', '.', 'I feel the warm tickle of the light beam sweeping over my face again. I can practically taste the char of realization dawning.', '“Darn,” the man behind me says, in the same tone normally reserved for ', '. The scrambler’s muzzle pulls back slightly.', '“Then you’ll just have to take us where we want to go,” the woman says.', '“No, I don’t\\xa0.” Now that they’re getting the measure of the situation, it’s the moment to keep hitting before they can try to come up with other solutions. “You need me a hell of a lot more than I need you. Sure, you can shoot me, but then however many there are of you”—2,800 kilos worth of people, apparently, how many ', ' that?—“get to asphyxiate, or drift into a star, or get hit by some space junk, or—oh. Yeah, if you’re really lucky, you’ll get picked up by pirates. I hear they do some ', ' shit to their prisoners.”', '“Shut up,” the woman says, the words sounding squeezed through clenched teeth.', 'But no, \\xa0I’ve just gotten rolling. “Or, no, you know what would be even better than ', '? You could get picked up by an Imperial patrol if you figure out how to set off the emergency beacon. And then you get to explain to ', ' how you ended up in a ship that none of you can fucking pilot, and you have contraband weaponry, and you spaced the owner’s corpse, and—”', '“Shut up!” the woman shouts.', 'I feel like I’ve made my point. I spread my hands a little wider. “Tell you what, out of respect for pulling one over on me, I’ll drop you off on the nearest station and I won’t even tell anyone. No hard feelings. We just go our separate ways.” Hell no, \\xa0I’m spacing these fuckers into the vacuum at the first opportunity. They came into my fucking ship, crawled under my skin like parasites, and now nothing is ever going to smell right again. It’ll stick in my brain.', '“Lydia—” the man behind me starts.', '“You shut up too, Ayren,” she snaps. “I need to think.”', 'But Ayren just keeps going. “We can’t go to the next station.” His tone is calm, reasonable, and I’d buy it more if I didn’t still feel the barrel of that scrambler brushing against my close-cropped curls.', '“Cargo manifest said you were going to Iota Dover station. It’s on the way.” Bullshit, of course, that’s obvious now. But I can play dumb to keep him talking and figure out the scam.', '“We can’t stay in the Empire,” he says. “We need to go to Selanor VI. Or any Seventh Satrapy world. A planet, though.”', 'I don’t need him to spell it out for me. “Sounds like you’ve got a problem, then.” Fuck Haddan-the-parasitic-wasp-in-human-form. And fuck these people. I don’t know which side they’ve managed to piss off in the rapid disintegration of the Empire, and I really could not care less. I’m not getting killed for them.', 'Hands—must be Lydia, she’s a charmer—yank my safety netting off. “Whoa there, whoa, no need to—” I start, and then my Traveler shrieks a warning half a second before Lydia punches me in the jaw. My teeth slam together, I swallow blood, and go limp. Lydia pops me off the couch like she’s ripping an innocent, slimy sea creature out of its shell.', '“Get her out of here,” Lydia snarls. “Put her in one of the containers. I’ll figure something out.”', 'Ayren grabs me by the back of the neck and shoves me toward the door. I have to reach for the frame or go into it face first. But it’s fine. I can play the cooperative prisoner for now. Because I know my work, I know my ', ', and Lydia isn’t going to be able to do shit. Not even my auntie could unfuck the puzzle I made of the nav systems when she tried to repo the ', ' eight years ago. All I have to do is wait.', '\\xa0', 'And wait. And take a nap. And then wait some more. And listen to my Traveler huff about the entire situation. The container isn’t uncomfortable; it’s probably not fun if you’re packed in here with a whole lot of other people like they were, but there’s room to stretch. I just wish Ayren hadn’t picked the one that smelled like farts. Hell, maybe they all smelled like farts. That’s something that happens when people get nervous.', 'Outside, I hear the muffled sounds of people talking, singing. Whatever little toy they had interfering with the station sensors while they were hiding in here, it must be some kind of control module instead of pure shielding. I’m itching to find one of those and take it apart. Too bad Ayren was smart enough to net my hands together.', 'A scrape, and the top of the container comes off. I catch a whiff of the synth strawberry scent again—speak of the devil and there he is. I can hear the talking more distinctly now, shit like, “Lydia will figure it out” and “How does anyone ', ' in this?” and “The first crop we’ll plant is\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” The singing, though, I don’t recognize, which means it’s not one of the half dozen most common languages in this neck of the galaxy. Small religious or ethnic group, probably, pried out of the planet they’d colonized fair and square centuries ago. The Empire always liked shitting on the little guys.', '“I want to talk to you,” Ayren says.', '“I was listening to the music.”', '“It’s not for you.” He slides into the container and pulls the top shut behind him.', '\\xa0', '“You’re singing in my ship.” And in case that isn’t pointed enough: “Which isn’t for you.”', 'A long pause, followed by a long sigh. “Songs for the Sabbath.”', 'Yep, religious sect. It’s not something that’s ever signified to me; everyone’s credits spend the same. Questionable privilege of living in the underbelly, I guess.

Sorry, Ayren, I can’t help you.”', '“You mean ', ',” he says.', '“Can’t. If you wanted to make it into the Satrapy, you should have hijacked something with more mass. Then you might have a chance in hell. But they’ve got all the gates sewed up tight.” Something with enough mass could at least try to skip without a gate. There was a slim chance of making it\\xa0, and to someone desperate enough to try to hijack a ship to start, maybe that would be enough.', '“Haddan was supposed to get us on a blockade runner.”', '“Haddan fucked us both. We should go complain. Or let me guess\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. you told him you needed fast, when you really meant big.”', 'Silence. Finally, “We never wanted to leave our homes. The only reason we even have a pilot is because Lydia\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. she’d left and wanted to stay out in the world. But her parents\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.”', 'That shouldn’t have felt like a little prick at the base of my spine, but it did. “Well, Lydia’s not going to be able to pilot this ship. Offer stands. I’ll take you to the next station. You guys can regroup, think of your next move. Don’t try to hijack another ship. It’s bad for your health.”', '“Going to the next station would be bad for our health! We barely got out of Corona Nine alive.”', '“I’m a criminal. We’re not known for our sympathy.” I like being alive. I don’t want to get blown to atoms in the space between stars. That’s not my kind of flying.', '“You’re a smuggler, not a murderer.”', '“I wouldn’t be killing you.”', '“Yes, you would.” He makes a frustrated sound and pops the top off the container again. “Selah,” he calls. “Come here.”', 'A moment later, I hear movement, and a little voice pipes up, “Yes, Papa?”', '“Oh no,” I say. “No, no, no. Fuck you.” My Traveler, less wise in the ways of manipulative shitheads than I am, is curious where this is headed, while I can already fucking feel it.', '“This woman is named Nata,” Ayren says. “She’s the pilot of this ship.”', '“She has funny eyes,” Selah says.

A few still life setups in corners, a shelf of sketchbooks and anatomy texts and older leatherbound tomes. A folio of Dali prints, another of Bosch, and one of a Swedish painter whose name I don’t remember. Canvases draped with light silk leaned against walls and doors and furniture. Through the silk I could see the canvases were painted, but not much more. The floor was strewn with lights: lamps, reflectors, mirrors, even a kerosene lantern. “Bet your landlord doesn’t like you having this.” I nudged the lantern with my shoe.', '“I have no landlord,” Crispin said, which told me more than the accent. “Ms. Dane, we should discuss the nature of my work. Previous models have expressed reluctance to operate under the conditions I require, and if this will be the case, I would rather find out now before we waste our time. Don’t you agree?”', 'I’d been afraid of this when I couldn’t find pictures of his recent work.

Personal connection distorts perspective.”', '“I doubt I’ll want to talk with you much, either.”', 'A ghost smile at that, faint as the blush. “I require exact duplication of poses from session to session. I may touch you, to restore a finger or an elbow to its proper place.”', '“Ask my permission first.”', '“Fair. And the last: You will not view our work while it proceeds. You may never see the pieces for which you pose. Should you happen to do so, you may not recognize yourself.”', 'That rang alarms I didn’t know I had. “What do you mean?”', '“I paint the noumenal—that which lies beneath appearance.

Some of the men wore tuxedoes, which I didn’t think you were allowed to wear except to weddings, funerals, and inaugurations. Then again, the gentlemen—and I use that term loosely, based on where their eyes went when they thought no one else was looking—the gentlemen at the 512 for Crispin’s opening seemed like they went to a lot of those.', 'Tonight the 512 was a white box, walls the color of one of those old fifties asylums where men used to check in their wives for “rest.” Aside from the buffet table, the gallerist had set up four black velvet booths, and lines of patrons waited outside them.

My first guess was wrong—the crowd there surrounded a woman I took for the gallerist, an elegant scarecrow laughing at a joke I doubt I would have found funny. I wormed through the crowd again, past the lines outside each nude and the buffet table. Crispin leaned into the far corner, staring at his glass of white as if wishing he could make it darker. In this sea of evening dress, he wore rumpled wool slacks, that same green shirt, and a blazer with a loose thread in the left shoulder. His shoes had never felt the touch of shine.', '“Just me?” I said.', 'Wine slopped over the rim of his glass, and he looked up; his smile seemed warm at first before he remembered to turn it cruel. “You came.” But I’d seen enough.

The chatter and the drifting atonal music and the clink of glasses against teeth forbid me that.

His target, or prey, and I wasn’t about to let these inauguration-goers cast me in either role.', '“Look at them if you want,” he said.', '“What’s with the curtains?”', '“I will allow indirect light only, under these circumstances.

If you can’t see how an octopus might be charming, don’t blame me for your lack of imagination.

I drew back my hand and the painting was paint again.', 'I stumbled out, glazed, sweating. The lights and walls and shirt fronts were too white. I held out a hand, but no one steadied me.

There was a universe beneath us, a blasted, writhing, whimpering world. Great pale cities towerd on planes of black ice beneath eclipsed suns that were themselves eyes.

I stared into one of those holes, past the flame, though my stomach convulsed and mortal terror squeezed my heart—but I could not look away. What waited past the dark was grotesque, yes, but beautiful. I stepped toward the hole where the painting had been.', 'I tripped. Shannon lay at my feet, dress torn, hair tangled around her face. I looked back to the painting, into the hole, and I remember being ', ' at the interruption, at her for tripping me—but the easel’s legs gave way, and the frame, and the vast space beyond collapsed to burnt canvas, and I was free, and suffocating.', 'I hoisted Shannon onto my back and staggered away from the flames. She breathed into my ear, but I did not understand her words. Maybe they were in another language altogether. I don’t trust myself to write them down.', 'I do trust other memories. I trust my memory of footprints on the sooty carpet, prints left by clawed, inhuman feet. And, as I turned to the stairs, I saw, in the roil beyond the window, sharp starry glints of multifaceted eyes, and flickering curved wings. Of Morrison there was no sign.', 'I slammed the door behind us, and we rejoined the human current away from the fire.', '\\xa0', 'Outside Crispin’s apartment, the sky was a dreadful yellow. Grace hadn’t swerved yet. Some weather folk still claimed she would. We were supposed to evacuate. We hadn’t.', '“You’re late,” he said.', '“I’m sorry.” He’d pulled a cloth over the canvas, as always when there was a risk I might look. Beneath, the painting might have been anything—or nothing. The drapery twitched in a draft, though there were no drafts in Crispin’s studio.', '“I saw your paintings,” I said. “From the gallery.” That was what I led with, not the monsters, not the fire. That I had seen the paintings, or what was left of them, seemed stranger in this room than the rest. “Crispin, things crawled out of them. There were holes in the canvas, and on the other side of the holes, I saw . . .” I could not finish.', 'His grip tightened on the brush. “Good.”', '“The police still don’t know where Bellkleft is. My agent almost died!”', '“We’re so close.”', '“Close to ', '?”', '“The place beyond death,” he said. “The root of the horror. The place where they lie sleeping.” His voice caught. He looked away. “Will you pose for me?”', 'The storm weighed upon us, closing in as we sank. A hurricane is an ocean come walking. I did not understand the sickness I had seen in Bellkleft’s apartment, or the beauty, or the wings. Crispin’s gaze settled, not on me, never on me, but beyond. I should have turned away and left. But I had come so far down with him already, and I felt that I would drown, rising on my own.', 'I took off my clothes, and became awakening. My body knew the pose by now. Crispin removed the drape from his canvas, and painted.', 'The light changed. Yellow deepened to orange, and the orange tinted green. Wind keened through bare branches.', '“Storm rising,” I said at our break.', '“Yes.” Branches tapped our window, scraped through ten silent minutes. Crispin whispered, and I could not make out the words, or even the language. His brushstrokes grew surer on the canvas. Long spans of time would pass before his eyes dawned over the painting’s edge, and when they did, a feverish light burned within. Each brushstroke was a cliff collapsing. Rain lashed the windows. I felt full of waking, filled with it, in building waves, as if I lay in a lover’s bed about to come, only with everything twisted ninety degrees to the left, bliss, pain, release all askew.', '“Crispin,” I said.', '“No talking.” His voice was tight as over-tuned piano wire.', '“Crispin, it’s time for a break.”', '“So close,” he said, and “Sorry,” and I do not think he was apologizing for the delay.', 'The wind screamed louder, and branches struck the window.', '“Crispin,” I said. “We’re three floors up.”', '“Yes.”', '“There are no trees outside your window.”', '“No.”', '“So what’s scratching?”', 'He did not speak. But I did not need his answer.', 'I had glimpsed them through smoke and flame and storm on Central Park West, the facets of their eyes, the stretch and shimmer of their wings. They had burst through the gate Crispin made of my face, and now they gathered close, to sing in the wind, to watch this new work end.', 'This work that I had not seen.', 'I had never looked at Crispin’s paintings of me, straight on in full light. In Bellkleft’s burning room, I had peered through a hole—but never seen the canvas itself. Crispin and I dove together, drowned together, but I had never seen what he saw when he looked at me.', 'I wanted, I needed, to know.', 'Rising from that divan felt like rising through an ocean of honey. My limbs strained to move, my breath came slowly, and the further I departed from my pose the harder it felt to do anything but return there, as if the substance of space had been reworked to fit me into that position, that warped pleasure, that broken release. He’d made me a key, and I dragged myself from the lock.', '“Go back,” Crispin said. “Lie down.” His voice was so tight cracks opened in it, and through the cracks I heard the waves of an unlit sea wash a dead city’s shore. The screams outside the windows swelled, the clattering things clawed harder at the glass—they’d broken Morrison’s apartment windows no problem, but that was out and this was in, and the two directions are nothing alike. I walked to the edge of the canvas.', '“Crispin. Stop.”', '“Go back,” he repeated, louder, and damn if I didn’t almost listen. But I didn’t, I wouldn’t. I had to see. God, it hurt; my muscles wanted to crawl from my bones, the whole world felt uphill, but I walked to the painting’s edge while his brush growled, and around—', 'Crispin caught me, or something that looked like Crispin but its pupils were worms. I pushed, and he pushed back, with strength those scrawny arms never earned. His thin lips rolled back to bare long teeth. I hit him in the nose with my forehead, heard bone crunch. His grip broke and he folded around his bleeding face. I swept past him to stand before my portrait, to see the monster he had made of me.', 'The thing upon that canvas was beautiful and hideous, promise and trap and temptation and door. And I saw through it. Oh, you old desert God who calls for the sacrifice of children, I saw through it—through the eyes, through the cracked skin and the wet red muscle, through the flayed flesh and the bare skull, saw the thing he’d summoned, this creature his mad beholding had chiseled from raw space, cancer and mother and blood, swollen, breaking open, shaking ropes of flesh, hair a coil of serpents, panes of body and breasts and thighs venting vapors that were fingers reaching through.', '“Crispin,” I said. “That’s not me.”', 'But I felt it inside me, around me, the form his eyes chiseled onto mine: fishhook pain twisted like a bad pregnancy. He’d made my image door and mother of monsters.', 'Outside the howls rose, as the mother’s children welcomed her.', '“Deliah,” he gurgled through blood. “I see—”', '“You see wrong.”', '“I painted you.”', '“No. Whatever that is, it’s not me. The sickness, the horror—it’s not in the world, Crispin. It’s in your eye.” I reached for the canvas, but the air around it burned. I fell back, swearing. The figure flexed. Cracks widened. I remembered chicks I’d seen burst from shells. Outside the mother-monster’s children circled in the storm, fanged mouths hungry to nurse. “You made this.”', '“Beautiful,” he said.', 'I slapped him, hard. He lunged for me, and I shoved him back. He fell toward the painting. His oils lay in tubes on the easel shelf; I grabbed one tube and squeezed it across the false me’s face and body, an umber streak. I spread the paint with a brush, mashing bristles to canvas to obscure eyes and ruin the painting’s neck and curve of shoulder.', 'Crispin screamed and seized me from behind. The brush tumbled from my hand and we fell together, me on top, knocking out his wind. I grabbed him by the shoulders, pointed him toward the window. “Look! Just fucking ', '”', 'Claws and wings scrabbled against the glass. But I only remember stillness, as Crispin stared into the facets of those glittering eyes, gray into gray, the inhuman faces pressed against his window. His jaw slacked, strange, wondering, like someone for the first time recognizing his face in a mirror.', 'The storm pressed us down.', 'He tore his gaze from theirs, and turned back to the painting, wondering, slow, for the first time scared. “She’s almost through.”', 'She strained against the paint, to burst into our world from Crispin’s mad fantasies. My smear would not seal her. She was a dream, and dreams can’t be forgotten, only deposed.', 'I dragged Crispin to the canvas.', 'He shook his head.', 'I grabbed another brush, loaded it with the paint he’d mixed that most resembled one of the colors of my skin—and forced it into his hand.', '“Don’t paint her,” I said. “Paint me. As I am. Not as you see.”', 'He looked again, at me, and this time I looked back.', 'With trembling hand, he touched his brush to canvas.', 'The scream I heard next was not the wind. It howled inside me, with strange and deep words. I will not write here. You’ve heard them, I think, in nightmares just before they break.', '\\xa0', 'The storm passed. We were spared the worst of it, they say.', 'To seal takes longer than to break. Two months have passed, and I visit him three times a week. We talk before he paints. Not about truth or horror or that other stuff. He talks about his mother, her death; about roasting coffee, and about a time he nearly drowned as a boy, at summer camp, and woke to find his ribs broken from CPR. I tell him about my brothers, about Georgia. He doesn’t believe about the roaches in Savannah. Northern boy.', 'And then we paint me over her. She’s stopped trying to break through. I think the talking is almost as important as the painting.', 'And then, Jesus, last week Crispin called me. He has my number, though he never used it before. Called me to say he was taking Steve and some other old classmates out for dinner, and would I like to join them?', 'He paid me a share of the Bellkleft take—the old man’s still missing—so money’s not a problem for the moment. Work continues. I’m acting again, and polishing the one-woman show.', 'Shannon’s recovering. The lung’s mostly better. The mind, too. She’s back to work, a few days a week, and she keeps calling me about the show. It’s weird to hope your agent likes your work because it’s good, not just because you saved her life.', 'As for the children of the paintings, with their shining eyes and curved wings—I don’t know what happened to them. Maybe they died without their mother. Maybe not. I read crime reports and watch to see if there are more missing dog posters around my neighborhood than usual. Maybe they’re still out there, hiding, building strength, waiting for someone else to shape their mother into being.', 'If so, maybe this will serve as a warning. If anyone reads it.', 'But it’s late, and I owe my own mama a letter. She wants news, though I don’t have much—just questions.', 'There were monsters. I saw them, and anyway if they weren’t real, where did Morrison Bellkleft go? They’re out there still. They always were.', 'They have no world but ours.', '\\xa0', '“Crispin’s Model” copyright © 2017 by Max Gladstone', 'Art copyright © 2017 by Samuel Araya']}\n"

The roast was taking too long and Trevor was in the living room being charming instead of mixing up the salad dressing—', '— and the doorbell was ringing and no one was answering it and I huffed my way to the door and forced a smile onto my face as I wrenched it open.', 'As soon as I saw him, I knew I was doomed.', '“Hi,” he said, “I’m Aarav.”', '“Vashti’s brother,” I said, seeing his bear-beard and wolf-smile and feeling my stomach plummet, “of course.”', 'His hand was hot in mine.', 'I’d been doing so well.

Not because one snort would wake you up covered in blood at Central Booking or Lincoln Hospital, but precisely because it would not, because you’d get away with it, and remember how magnificent it was, and forget every awful consequence, and keep doing it, until you’d lost everything.', 'And now Once had walked into my living room, his ass perfect and his eyes alive with the knowledge of what a weak creature I was. And I was doomed.', 'I led him into the living room.', '“Your polymer is impressive,” Fennis was saying to Vashti in a superlatively unimpressed voice—but then again he’d never liked her, and ', ' —and produced his own polymer, a jagged solid jelly in a glass jar, marbled and muddied with a mix of clear first-generation inert polymer and the darker second-gen stuff that could change color, cast light, play videos, and he opened the app on his phone and we watched it come to life, writhing and thrashing and then elongating, sharpening, shattering the glass with a single explosive motion. It penetrated Vashti’s polymer, which denatured and was assimilated into Fennis’s. Before her cry of protest was completed his polymer spat hers back out and both stood there as though the whole thing had never happened. His finger swirled on his phone screen and the thing took a wobbly bow. Everyone applauded.', '“Field control assertion like that must have cost you a pretty penny,” she said sourly.', '“Not really. Some boys on my block are battlers, they love sharing their new tricks.”', '“Otto is working on a story about polymers,” said Trevor, patting my thigh proudly when I came to hover over him and silently command him to return to the kitchen. He was using That Tone, the one that said ', '. “About the dangers. Aren’t you, honey?”', '“I am,” I said, doing my best to simultaneously smile at our guests and glare at him.', '“Vastly exaggerated, those dangers,” said Aarav, who I’d been doing a damn good job of not looking at since he walked in the door, except now he was talking so I had to look, and, yes, damn, there it was, those broad chunky shoulders, that ample bottom he was surely standing in three-quarters profile precisely to best display, and I hated Vashti so much in that moment, for calling that morning to plead with us to make space for him at our annual vernal equinox supper—“He just moved to New York, he hardly knows any other gay guys, I feel so bad for him.” I gave him the most withering smile I could find. He continued, “No more dangerous than cell phones or networked microwaves, and no one’s writing articles about ', '.” His face was warm, almost sad, and the multiplex of my mind stuttered to life with a dozen different pornographic scenes starring only us.', '“You should interview Aarav for your story,” Vashti said. “He works on polymers!”', '“Not exactly,” he said. “I do communications for Verizon. My unit does focus a lot on polymer-related promotions. The kaiju battle community is a very important demographic.”', '“You two talk,” Trevor said. “I’ll go make the dressing.”', 'And what could I do, but be seated, beside Aarav, and curse the smallness of our couch, because I could feel the heat of his leg where it pressed against mine, and surely everyone in the room would know, at once, how badly I wanted him, what a disgusting pervert I was? And, of course, matters were made immeasurably worse by his wisdom and sense of humour—he had everyone giggling, which meant I had to giggle too, lest someone wonder why I wasn’t.', '“I heard that hammer sales are plummeting,” someone said.', '“Screwdrivers too,” said someone else.', 'Ten people at our party, and suddenly everyone had something to say about nanopolymers. I didn’t care one way or another about the damn things. They assigned me the story because I’d cultivated relevant contacts on previous articles. I drank my gin and tonic in one long gulp and switched to wine.', 'Aarav would not let me stay silent. When I failed to weigh in on whatever theory or fact or opinion was passing around the room, he touched my arm and said, “What do you think, Otto?” Was that because he was a kind and generous person? Or did he know the game I was playing—the game of hunger, of lust, of trying to be good—and could play it just as well as me? The problem with returning to the smiling happy world of dinner parties and office jobs and responsible adults after a long addiction is that you’ve seen people at their worst, especially yourself, and it’s hard to assume the best about anyone.', '“When my old broom wore out, I didn’t buy a new one,” someone said. “So much easier to just download broom instructions and beam them into your polymer.”', '“Dinner!” Trevor called, and I sprang from the couch. He frowned at the glass in my hand, made stern eye contact.', '“We never buy new toys for Tripp anymore,” said Fennis, leading the troupe into the dining room. The oven had heated the whole place up so high that we’d had to open a window, and an undercurrent of cold city winter wind tugged at our sleeves. “Whatever he wants, we can just make it on the spot. Now the problem is, he keeps on begging us for more and more putty! Quite the status marker at school, how big your total polymerload is.”', '“Kids are so insufferable with it,” someone else said. “I made the mistake of calling it ‘magic clay’ the other day and my seven-year-old said ‘It’s not clay, it’s a plastic-based gel. And it’s not magic, it’s got millions of tiny machines inside of it that respond to commands from wireless devices', '’ Can you imagine?”', 'We could all imagine.', '“So is your article about the death of the manufacturing sector?” Aarav asked, sitting down beside me, and his eyes were immense, so light they looked like gold. “They say we’re less than five years from polymer automobiles. Imagine being able to upgrade to the latest car model with just a software update!”', '“That’s ridiculous,” someone said. “Toys and simple tools are one thing, but shape-memory polymers are a long way from being able to emulate complex machinery. Nanite stereolithography doesn’t even do batteries very well—the storage capacity is shit, they overheat…”', '“I don’t know,” someone else said. “I spun mine into a laptop, on a business trip last month. Wasn’t winning any beauty contests—battery was like a weird bloated tumor on the back, and it kept, I don’t know, writhing—but it got the job done.”', '“They let you take programmable matter on a plane?”', '“No, of course not,” she said. “But Virgin is doing this thing now where you can give them your polymer at the gate and get a bar code voucher, and then when you get off at your destination they give you the exact same amount back. They even get the blend of first-gen and second-gen stuff precisely right.”', '“Delta, too,” someone said.', 'I prayed for them to stop. I drank a third cup of wine praying it, practically chanting it out loud. I wanted them to be quiet and I wanted them all to get the fuck out. Especially Aarav.', 'Of course it was silly. No one could see the filthy thoughts I was thinking, how precarious this lavish scene of domestic virtuosity truly was. No one suspected how unhappy I was, how hungry. No one but Trevor, who put his hand out to stop me when I picked up the bottle of wine.', 'Trevor was older, wiser. He’d picked me up out of the gutter—or, more accurately, picked me up off the floor of a dark room at a particularly nasty sex party. It was his apartment we were in; his job that bought the roast and the good wine and the cheeses on the platter. And I loved him. I truly did. But he was good and I was bad and his smile said he knew I was a fraud, and loved me anyway.', '“So?” Aarav asked. “Your article. You haven’t said what dangers you’re covering.”', '“Hacking,” I said, passing the rolls, pleased with how perfect they’d come out, how brown. The roast, on the other hand, lying in a dish of its own blood, was a different story. Our oven heated unevenly. One corner was blackened and burnt. Absolutely everything in the world was wrong.', '“What, like that whole thing about how terrorists might make your polymer bracelet turn into a razor blade and slit your wrist open? I thought people gave up on that kind of hysterical scare-mongering two years ag—”', '“Not that, so much,” I said. “There’s this whole new wave of what they’re calling aggregative malware, which could in theory cause polymers to compulsively link up. Predictives anticipate some pretty destructive scenarios as a result. Especially once the third-gen stuff comes out…”', '“Interesting,” he said, his sturdy forearm innocuous on the table beside mine. Against mine.', '“Not sure I buy it, myself,” I said. “Though lots of smart people do.”', '“Thinkpieces will be the death of us all,” Fennis said. “Every other day people are trying to tell you we’re sowing the seeds of our own destruction with some stupid thing. No offense, Otto.”', '“None taken. Anyway, I’m with you. Even if it’s true, what are we supposed to do about it?”', 'Everyone agreed that we were helpless, guiltless.', 'Trevor turned his head in a slow circle, his smile immense, proud, blissful at what we’d built, what a life we had, what wonderful friends, what a stable glorious home he’d made for me. For us. I tried my best to smile back.', 'I loved him. So, what was I hungry for? What did I still want, why couldn’t I keep from imagining ravaging Aarav in the wreckage of our living room?', '“It ', 'inherently less secure,” someone said. “You can’t encrypt them in the same way. Your shaping app can lock the nanites, but only until something with a stronger field comes along. It’s fundamental to how the distributed CPU functions.”', '“I went to a kaiju battle last week,” Vashti said. “That’s the whole point of them, that struggle for control. Some pretty big mother fuckers.”', '“I’ve only ever seen the web videos. And that awful reality competition show.”', '“It’s so much fun,” she said. “Grimy, and a little bit scary. Some of these creatures look like something from a nightmare. Most fights, there’s this part at the end, what they call the death roll, where it’s essentially one big Silly Putty blob wrestling with itself to see which one has the stronger field control. People sitting in the front rows say they can feel their polymers moving in their pockets.”', '“Did you read that article, ', '”', 'Everyone had read that article.', '“Good lord,” Trevor said, finally. “This is worse than lunch with the straight guys from work, hearing them talk about football!”', '“Have you guys seen ', ' yet?” I asked, because Trevor had me well-trained, and nothing derailed a boring conversation better than a controversial art/horror film. “That guy they got to play the demon lover was ', '”', 'The night went on like that. Everyone happy but me—or everyone doing just as good a job as me of faking it. Snow and wind hammering at our windows. People peeling off, departing with regrets as the night got longer and the storm got worse. Me doing my damnedest not to make eye contact with Aarav, not to notice how smart he was, how once he’d voiced an opinion on something it just felt right, like my own, like it had always been my own. I tried, too, not to notice how nice it was to hang out with another gay guy who wasn’t Trevor, Trevor whose prim paranoia about my inherent weakness kept us from all but the most unfuckable friends.', '“Shit,” Aarav said, past two, the last guest, long after his sister had left, seeing the snow of an early-spring surprise storm stacked against our glass. “It’s piled up so much!”', '“Subways run all night,” I said, cheering inside as I went to get his coat. “Best part of New York City life, newbie.”', '“I have my car,” he said. “I know it’s not practical for the city, but I just can’t bring myself to get rid of it.”', '“That sucks,” Trevor said. “It isn’t safe to drive in this. Should be all plowed and cleaned-up by morning.” His eyes flitted to mine, made the smallest frown, a fraction of a second, long enough for me to read whole oral epics into it—he could see my weakness, knew what I ached to do to Aarav, saw how unwise it would be to have him in our house for a single unnecessary extra second. But he could see, too, with his exquisite WASP etiquette, that there was no other option than to say to him: “You can crash here for the night, if you want.”', '“You sure?” Aarav asked, looking to me, and I was conveniently taking a long sip of wine at that point, screaming inside, ', ', but eventually the sip had to end, and I nodded as enthusiastically as I could.', 'He did the dishes. We made up the guest bedroom. We all watched polymer videos online, saw the terrifying monsters and fancy clothes and seawalls and emergency shelters that people had built from nanopolymer, watched trailers for three or four new polymer-based reality competition shows. We placed our polymers and our phones in a heap by the charging hub. I was furious with Trevor for extending the invitation, with myself for getting so drunk, for enjoying the husky sound of Aarav’s laughter so much.', '“You shouldn’t drink so much,” Trevor said, once the bedroom door was shut behind us.', '“What?” I stammered, all false innocence, because, of course I shouldn’t. “Why?”', '“You embarrassed yourself. Practically drooling over Aarav.”', '“I was not!” I said, reddening, from alcohol and guilt, shame and defensive anger.', 'Trevor shrugged and undressed, like it was all too obvious and inconsequential to argue over. I’d been surprised, when we first started dating, when we had The Talk about our sexual parameters, that he insisted on monogamy. “Addicts never stop with just a little,” he’d said, and what could I say to that? What could I say whenever he brought that up, which was often—whenever he wanted to end an argument? And what could I say now? Because any argument I offered would be a lie. He was right and I was wrong, he was perfect and I was wretched. I slid into bed beside him, felt the whisper of the wind from where we’d left the window open, heard the clanking of our radiators trying too hard. I touched his hip with one hand, which he seized, and held.', 'He had been right, too, about my having had too much to drink. I slept poorly, in and out of hungry dreams—burnt meat and hairy barrel chests—too dizzy to lay still, until I sat up with my head spinning and my stomach doing its best to expel the charred corner of the roast that I’d taken for myself so none of our guests would eat it and think less of us.', 'Dawn, almost. The sky just starting to brighten past the normal city luster of snowy winter nights. Everything else a blur. Was I home? Was I back in the hallway of that filthy apartment building where a john had kicked me out and I’d fallen asleep outside his door? I staggered towards the bathroom, imagining myself projectile vomiting absolutely everything absolutely everywhere.', 'I had to puke. This much was true. But was that why I was out of bed? I walked slowly, silently, suspecting in my groggy fuddled state that this was all an elaborate ruse to watch Aarav sleep, taunt myself with his tantalizing profile and hope for a glimpse of a furry bare arm or the sheet-hidden outline of an erection. But would I be able to stop myself there, in the doorway, watching?', 'I wondered, peering into the dark. ', 'What I saw was so much better than mere sleeping nudity. And so much worse.', 'His ass. Bare, damp with sweat in the overheated apartment, moving, a dire implacable rhythm. The chubby, perfect, naked bulk of him. My boyfriend beneath him. Trevor’s groans of pleasure. Aarav’s hand, clamping over Trevor’s mouth to quiet him.', 'They didn’t hear me. I’d never seen Trevor eyes look like that. I didn’t move. I watched helplessly, wanting to, not wanting to want to. Memorizing what I saw, for the long lonely nights to come.

Rising ocean levels still have plenty of time to destroy us.”', '“All our fault, either way.”', '“Is it?”', '“You don’t think so?”', '“What else could we have done?”', '“That’s exactly the problem. Keep telling yourself you’re helpless, pretty soon you’ll start to act like it.”', '“They’re still out there,” Aarav said, and his voice was just as wise, just as insightful—except now I could hear his wisdom for what it was, what all of us were doing when we tried to sound like we understood what was going on around us. Cave men at the campfire trying to feel less afraid. “Just because we can’t see them, doesn’t mean they’re not coming.”', 'Rage lit me up inside. Revenge plots percolated. Bloody murder tingled in my fingertips, aching to be let out.', 'And it felt…familiar. Murder wasn’t meth, not exactly, but it brought back the old buried joy, the bliss when I’d scored enough to last me through the whole weekend, the ecstasy before the first hit, when my head was still full of perfect scenarios, the thousands of sexual partners and the endless dance floor hours and the loud howling down late-night residential streets. I looked at Aarav and I felt alive in a way I’d spent years trying not to feel. Except that now there was no reason not to. No Trevor telling me to stop.

Something I could control.', ', I thought, but I knew the odds, could do them in my head, math had always been my strong suit, back when math mattered—two thirds of the city’s population made it out alive, half of them ended up in a camp, and there were four possible camps.

Kids fighting over the radio. Music came and went, replaced by a tired-sounding woman reading bad news. Beside me, a bandaged man read a newspaper whose front page sported a particularly gnarly spider woman kaiju.', 'I thought of hiding from Aarav. Keep my distance, bide my time while I concocted some spectacular revenge.', ' He didn’t know that I knew. That I’d seen. The next morning, over coffee and complaints of hangovers, he and Trevor certainly hadn’t said anything about it.', 'And neither had I. Not that day, and not the next. I waited.

My nerve failed at dinner, that night, but the next day, surely—', 'The next day Trevor died in the ring of radioactive fire that took out a third of us.', 'So: I would not hide. I moved closer. Aarav’s arms, like mine, were taut and muscular from running the hand-cranked generators that powered the radio, the medical equipment, batteries for approved non-networkable electronic devices.', 'Somebody ate the bacon off his plate, and I saw that Aarav was blind.', 'The first kaiju assault was an accident. A faulty German software update rolled out in select markets; conflicting code in a bloated proprietary phone manufacturer operating system; aggregative commands accidentally exploiting field-control backdoors to cause polymer to seek out polymer. No shape, no animating intelligence, just an ever-increasing plasticine blob of horror that bored through walls, crushed buildings, leveled streets until it had assimilated every shred of shape-memory polymer animated by the same operating system and come to a sated stop. At which point forty German cities were mostly gone.', 'After that, everything happened so fast. Four hundred million tons of styrene polymers in active use worldwide. The software update in question was easy to copy, change, twist.', '“Aarav!” I said, standing over him, enjoying several milliseconds of him smiling and looking confused and ashamed.', '“I’m so sorry,” he said, gesturing to his sunglasses. “I’m—”', '“Otto!” I said, and took his hand. “Otto Trask? You stayed—”', '“Otto!” He cried, his mouth a trembling crooked rhombus of happiness, his face darkening like he was about to cry. No flicker of shame, no hint of guilt.

I hated him worse for it.', '“And Vashti?”', 'It took him so long to answer me. “Gone too. Where were you, when it happened?”', '“Home. Writing.” ', 'Leaves had piled up at our feet. The forest smelled sharp and smoky. I smiled for what felt like the first time. When Trevor died, all my anger at him turned on myself. I’d been such a bad boyfriend. I’d been so hungry. He’d been smart enough to see it. My fault, that he’d fucked Aarav. My hunger.', 'One week after Germany, Ukrainian resistance fighters gave six hundred thousand dollars to the nineteen-year-old kid who came in third on the second season of ', 'a crowd favorite with a twelve-foot-tall version of a certain famous Japanese movie monster. He gave them a flash drive with his monster’s schematics on it. Then they pegged it to a more aggressive form of the aggregative software and added in a remote control. The next day the residents of Russia’s two largest cities found that something was compelling their polymers to move on their own, heading straight for the nearest storm drain or toilet. Breaking through whatever they used to try to contain them. That evening, two four-hundred-foot-tall clear Godzillas rose out of the Moskva and Neva Rivers. They couldn’t breathe fire, back then, but they didn’t really need to. Helicopters dropped bombs on one of them, and they did almost as much damage as the monster did. The monster’s polymer fragments re-assembled and she continued on her merry way.', '“What’s your plan?” Aarav asked, his hand holding mine, with no lust or lewdness this time, just fear and hunger and loneliness and need, and I smiled, at it, at his weakness, at the knowledge of how I could use it to destroy him.', '“Watch my money dwindle. Pick up odd jobs where I can.”', '“Yeah,” he said. “Me, too.”', 'Dogs barked. So many people in the camp had dogs. A gunshot in the distance: upstate boys hunting deer, like this was any other autumn, which for them it pretty much was. Girls in leather and camouflage swapped packages. Black marketeers, officially tolerated because they filled in the gaps that the under-resourced camp administration couldn’t.', 'Corporations, governments, out-of-power political parties, local militias—everybody started building their own monsters. People stockpiled polymer. Nations took steps to ban or destroy it. When the mayor of Quezon City ordered wholesale surrender from his own citizens, the subsequent stockpile was stolen by—or possibly sold to—a street gang, who made a handful of mid-sized monsters and used them to break their members out of several prisons.', 'Old hierarchies of power were inverted. Mighty nations were powerless to stop the rogue kaiju of terror cells and coder collectives. But we ', 'being melodramatic, when we called it an apocalypse. Only a few big cities had been hit. Most kaiju dust-ups took place in geopolitical hot spots, contested spaces where conventional violence had been powerless to rupture the status quo: Kashmir, Tibet, Chiapas, the Northwest Passage, the Diaoyu Islands, Jerusalem. The North Cali/South Cali border. Easy to see them as monsters, to look in their eyes and see a malevolent intelligence, but they were still just machines, masterpieces of programming, doing what humans had programmed them to do.', '“You have people who know you’re here?”', 'He shrugged. “Supposedly they keep people informed. But most of my people are in big cities, and who the fuck knows what’s really going on there?”', 'Every day now was chillier than the one before. New York fell in late March, and we’d been blessed with warm weather ever since. Almost October, now, and I felt it in my tightening testicles: the fear of winter, the stripped-down human animal whimpering in the wind.', 'I shut my eyes and I could see it, as it had been in the thousands of photos that people had taken and shared in the instants before they died.

It was my guilty pleasure. I’d only go late at night, when I was by myself, so no one would know.”', '“It’s a damn shame,” I said. “You became a New Yorker just in time to lose the city forever.”', 'His laughing lowered, and wobbled, and somewhere along the way it became crying.', '“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve just been so lonely. You can’t imagine.”', '“I think I can,” I said.', '“It’s so good to find you again.”', '“Likewise,” I said, and meant it, my smile sincere, because here, finally, was something I could do, even if that something was murder.', 'I hugged him. He hugged me back, hard, grateful; blind, as Trevor had never been, to the wickedness inside my head.', 'I took in the scene around us, assessing my options.

Those would do.', '“Now you wouldn’t happen to have a stash of real coffee squirrelled away somewhere, would you?”', 'I laughed. “I wish.”', 'I didn’t do it just then. I could have.

That night. Me and Trevor.”', '“You ', '?” I said, and the rage was back, grown to kaiju proportions, and my grip tightened on his shoulders, slid down to take hold of his biceps and squeezed to stop my arms from shaking.

A manta ray kaiju; a flying polymer as big as the George Washington Bridge. Massive fin-wings propelled it through the sky with slow majestic strokes.', '“What is it?” Aarav asked, his breath hot in my ear.', '“Nothing,” I said, staring into the sky.

When Violet Crowley, the sixteen-year-old daughter of New Earth’s Founding Father, is smuggled an artifact covered in mysterious markings, it’s up to her and her friends to decipher the message. “The Tablet of Scaptur” is a standalone story set before the events of\\xa0', '\\xa0(', ').', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\n', '\\xa0', 'The rock was about the size of a coffee cup. Its surface was rough and its color varied between vivid red and dusky rust, split at intervals by what looked to be short fissures of ashy gray.', '“But they’re not really fissures,” Violet pointed out. “I thought so at first—but I was wrong. They’re markings. Like—like some kind of ', '.”', 'Her friends stood all around her. They leaned in toward the object she held in her hand. They, too, could now see that something strange and mysterious had been chiseled deliberately and painstakingly onto the rock. The more times she turned it over, the more the tiny carved symbols seemed to proliferate, almost as if the very act of observing them was prompting more to be born—which was, Violet knew, a ridiculous, preposterous, totally impossible notion.', 'And yet.', '“Here—let me see it.”', 'She handed the rock to Rez, who had made the request in his usual impatient tone. Steve Reznik was a genius—he would tell you so himself if you didn’t pick up on it right away—and geniuses apparently didn’t have to bother with silly trifles such as politeness.', 'Rez examined the rock with a pinched, diligent focus, a rigorous attention that caused the skin on his forehead to crumple up and his lips to make a thin tight line. He shifted the rock from one palm to the other, and then back to the original palm.', 'He grimaced. He grunted. He returned the rock to Violet. He didn’t say so—he would never admit such a thing—but he was stumped, too.', '“My turn,” Shura said. “I’ve already looked at it about a million times, but there’s no harm in trying again.”', 'Violet passed the rock to Shura.', 'They had gathered in Danny’s living room. The room was awash in the muted light of fall—a moody, melancholy shade that was created by the Color Corps in Farraday, one of the six cities of New Earth. The inside of Danny’s apartment, like the apartments all around it, and the apartments around ', ' apartments, was a square white box. Space was carefully rationed on New Earth, for the same reason that recycling was mandatory. This was a world that hovered in the sky above the ruins of Old Earth, a world requiring constant calibrations and crucial, orbit-sustaining balances.', 'Danny’s home was clean and neat, but it had no personality, no soul, no distinguishing characteristics, nothing to indicate that he cared at all about putting his individual stamp on it. Violet couldn’t blame him. He was a cop with New Earth Security Services, and he didn’t spend much time here. Today was a rare day off.', 'Everyone wanted a turn with the rock. Present were Violet, Shura, Danny, Rez, and Rez’s seven-year-old sister, Rachel. Violet had only been around Rachel once or twice before, but she’d heard lots of stories about how smart she was. Scary-smart, in fact. Rez had been taking her to school that morning when he received Violet’s group text on his wrist console, coded URGENT:', 'Rez had known right away that it was important. Violet never summoned them that way. And so he’d grabbed Rachel’s small hand and hopped off the tram two stops before the one nearest to her school.', 'Rachel didn’t ask any questions; she was too excited. She had long dreamed of hanging out with her big brother’s friends, but had never been allowed to. This was her golden chance. She knew that Rez would somehow cover for her with the school authorities. He’d either come up with a clever story, or maybe he’d hack into the Attendance Center and change the notation beside her name for today’s date from “Absent” to “Present.” It would be a snap for her brilliant big brother. She had overheard someone say that Rez had a “once-in-a-generation mind.” Rez, of course, had corrected her when she told him about it: They ', ' have called his intellectual capacity “dazzling, astonishing, and world-transforming” and left it at that.', 'Shura dug at the rock with a pink-painted fingernail.', '“Hey, watch it,” Danny protested. “You might chip off a marking or something.”', 'Shura shook her head vigorously. Her straight black hair swished back and forth across her narrow shoulders. “It’s ', 'too hard for that,” Shura said, a bit defensively. She handed the rock to Danny. “See for yourself.”', 'He accepted it in his joined-up palms with a careful reverence, as if he were being trusted with a religious relic. Instead of moving the rock, he moved his head from side to side, examining the facets. Then he, too, tried to scratch at it with a thumbnail.', '“You’re right,” Danny said. “Nothing’s flaking off at all. Not a single grain. That’s the hardest rock I’ve ever felt. And those marks—I don’t have a clue what they mean.”', 'He turned to Rachel, having noticed her eager face and small, outstretched hand, and passed her the rock. She looked intently at it for a second or so, then reached up and deposited it back into Violet’s waiting palm. It had traveled all the way around the circle.', 'Like the rock itself, they were right back where they started from:', 'They had no idea what the symbols meant. They only knew that in the few minutes that had elapsed since they had all arrived here, something about the rock and its markings tugged at them, individually and collectively. The mystery was like a fever they had all caught on contact. They shared a fierce desire to tunnel below the surface of things and dig out the ', '.', 'Even here on New Earth, where most people kicked back and relaxed, reveling in the good fortune of having escaped the danger and tumult of Old Earth, content to let the Intercept keep them safe, the four of them couldn’t sit still.', ', Violet corrected herself, looking down at Rachel.', 'Violet had been absolutely right about her friends. The moment they glimpsed the rock, they ', ' to know what the symbols meant. They ', ' to figure it out. It didn’t matter if Rachel missed a day of school, or if Violet and Rez were late for their afternoon shift at Protocol Hall, or if Danny got no rest on his off-duty day, or if Shura’s mother kept sending her constant texts asking where she was.', 'They ', ' to solve the riddle of the rock.', '“I know you don’t want to go over the story again, but Rachel and I were the last ones to get here,” Rez said. “How’d you find this thing?”', 'Danny and Shura sat on the battered brown couch. Rez called dibs on the shabby green armchair, which meant Violet and Rachel were stuck with the carpeted floor. Violet didn’t mind. She preferred the floor. First she stretched out on her stomach, balancing her chin on a fist, and then she crunched up into a cross-legged crouch, and then she leaned languidly along one side of her body, propping herself on an elbow. Violet liked to change positions frequently. She needed to move while she was solving a problem. Sitting still was like thinking the same thought over and over again.', 'Before she retold the story of how she came to possess the rock bearing the peculiar symbols, Violet took a second to savor the fact that she had friends like these, friends who dropped everything when she needed help, friends who were smart and resourceful\\xa0and up for an adventure, friends who didn’t judge her.', 'The non-judging part was important because she came with what might politely be described as “baggage.” Her father, Ogden Crowley, was president of New Earth and some people didn’t like him, which apparently meant they couldn’t like ', ', either. Politics divided people, Violet had learned. Not everybody thought it was a good idea to create a new civilization high above the decaying surface of Old Earth, no matter what the advantages were, and no matter how dark and dangerous Old Earth had become by the twenty-third century.', 'There was even more trouble when he installed the Intercept, a technology that kept the population of New Earth secure.', 'Violet looked at the people in the room, one by one, and remembered all over again how much they meant to her. And as she remembered, she saw the little blue flash in the crook of her left elbow. The Intercept had just scooped up her affection, in the same way that it could scoop up her fear or her hate.', 'There was Shura, a painter who planned to go to medical school. She and Violet had been best friends since they were little girls.', 'There was Rez, who worked with Violet at Protocol Hall. The two of them were part of the large team that monitored New Earth twenty-four/seven. Through the chips implanted in the crook of everyone’s left elbow, the Intercept harvested emotions; those emotions were then filed away in the vast humming archive beneath the streets of New Earth.', 'There was Rachel, who seemed to be a lot nicer than her brother, Rez.', 'Then there was Danny Mayhew. He was eighteen—three years older than Violet, Shura, and Rez. He was the only one who had his own apartment; the others still lived with their parents.', 'Violet’s attention returned to the rock. She had placed it in the center of the coffee table. It seemed to throb with the fierce force of its mystery.', '“Okay,” she said. “Here’s how we got it.”', '\\xa0* * *', '“Shura and I were hanging out,” Violet went on, “and we were going out of our ', ' with boredom. First we went to the park.” Perey Park was a beautiful green square in the middle of Hawking, capital city of New Earth. “But we were still pretty bored. Hardly anybody else was there and nothing much was going on. So I said we should check out the Old Earth History Museum. I hadn’t been there since third grade. And there’s always a bunch of new exhibits.”', '“My class went there once,” Rachel cut in. “It’s great.”', 'Rez shot her a dark look.', '“Sorry,” Rachel muttered. She’d forgotten the Rez Rule: She could tag along but she could not, under any circumstances, participate in the conversation. She was a kid. Not equal to him and his friends.', '“So we took the tram over to Higgsville,” Violet continued. She didn’t want to override Rez and tell Rachel that it was okay to talk—Rachel was his sister, and his responsibility—but she felt sorry for the little girl and so she gave her a quick nod. The nod was her way of saying: ', '.', '“It was almost closing time,” Violet said, resuming her story, “and Shura and I had to be quick. We raced around the first three floors to see everything we possibly could. There’s ', ' of new stuff.” She took a deep breath, then plunged headlong into delighted recollection. “They’ve updated the interactive timeline and it’s ', '—it shows what happened to Old Earth, starting with the rise of the oceans at the end of the twenty-first century, and then it explains the Water Wars and the Mineral Wars. Terrible, sure—but fascinating. They’ve got this cool thing where they change the temperature in the spot where you’re standing, so you think you’re actually ', 'the ozone layer being shredded from greenhouse gases, molecule by molecule. I mean—right on your own ', '. And then there’s this new exhibit on how New Earth was built. A hologram of the Chief Engineer takes you through all the steps and explains how they keep New Earth suspended above the planet—and how they create an atmosphere without having a dome that covers the whole thing, which everybody was afraid they’d have to have. Can you imagine how ', ' that would be? Living inside a ', '? I mean, we’d probably feel like bugs caught in a jar. My dad said that’s what he and his friends used to do back on Old Earth when they were kids—catch bugs in jars and poke holes in the lids to let some air in.” She shivered. “Even if we ', ' breathe, we’d probably feel like we couldn’t.”', 'Violet paused. As her excitement grew, she spotted the telltale blue flash in the crook of her elbow—which meant that the chip was communicating her excitement to the Intercept, and the Intercept was adding it to her file. ', '“Anyway,” Violet went on, “we hear the closing chimes so we start back down the staircase. It’s this ginormous swooping thing—really wide, with this fancy wood and—” Another blue flash. She swallowed hard and counted to three. When she started talking again, she used a calm, even tone. She didn’t like giving the Intercept any more information about her than it already had. “We’d just gotten down to the main floor when we hear a click. A door in the wall next to the staircase sort of falls open. Just an inch or so. The door is marked ‘Authorized Personnel Only.’ It looks like maybe somebody’s gone in and hasn’t pulled it shut behind them. And so—”', '“Let me guess,” Danny said, interrupting her. “You ignore your big chance to go somewhere you’re not supposed to go and instead you turn right around and leave the building. Just like they told you to.”', 'He laughed. Everybody else did, too, including Violet herself. There was about as much chance of her passing up the opportunity to snoop as there was of Rez getting less than one hundred percent on a math quiz.', '“Um—no,” Violet said. “So I sneak in. Shura’s right beside me—like a best friend should be.” Shura nodded and gave her a thumbs up. Violet grinned and continued. “We’re in this long, ', ' corridor. All the doors are closed—except for the one we slip through. The doors say things like, ‘Archives’ and ‘Metallurgy Lab’ and ‘Communication Technology of Late Twentieth Century’ and ‘Planetary Artifacts.’ It’s pretty clear this is the backstage of the museum—the place where the scientists and the curators and the researchers hang out. Most people never get to see this—which is ', ' why I had to stay and explore.”', '“Right,” Danny said. “Like we all know—if you want Violet to do something, just tell her she’s not supposed to do it. That’ll ', ' she does it.”', 'He was still teasing her, and Violet knew it, and she didn’t mind. Not one bit. In fact, she kind of liked it. She didn’t know very much about Danny, but sometimes she found herself . . . ', ' about him. So far, her Intercept chip hadn’t registered when she heard his name or saw him across a room. But she had a funny feeling that it was only a matter of time before it did. She just hoped that if it happened in public, she’d have a chance to pull down her sleeve. Otherwise—', '“And ', ',” Violet said, reaching up and giving Danny a playful whack on the knee, “we walk along for a while longer, hoping we’ll come across an open door so we can see what’s going on in there. Suddenly a door slams. We whirl around. A woman’s rushing past us. She’s wearing a white lab coat. She’s got this white hair flying all over the place. She looks scared. And just before she gets to the door at the end of the corridor—where we came in—a bunch of cops come running out of another door. They grab her and start pulling her back. She’s like, ‘No, no, ', '! Let me ', '! I won’t say a word! I ', '!’ This cop tells Shura and me to mind our own business. They just keep dragging the woman away from the door and—”', '“They couldn’t have been cops,” Danny said. “No way. Cops would’ve identified themselves. Told her what she’d done wrong. And they wouldn’t have roughed her up. If she didn’t cooperate, the Intercept would have interceded. They must’ve been private security for the museum.”', '“Whatever.” Violet shrugged. “Anyway, while they’re trying to get her under control—there’s a lot of flailing and shouting and confusion—and I realize that she’s making a big fuss to distract them, so they won’t see her reaching for something in her lab coat. Next thing I know she’s pushing something into my hand and I stuff it in my pocket. I start to say something to her, but Shura pokes me with her elbow. And she’s right. Best policy is to keep my mouth shut.”', '“So that’s when you first saw it,” Rez said.', 'Violet nodded. “Yeah. The cops—” She stopped, giving Danny an obliging nod. “Okay, the ', '—don’t see her give it to me. They’re too focused on not letting her escape, I guess. We’re like, kind of invisible. Anyway, the moment they clear the corridor, we get out of there as fast as we can. We run out the front door. Down the long steps. We’re halfway to the tram stop by the time we even take a breath.”', '“And then,” Rez said, “you did a thorough examination of the rock.”', '“Yeah.”', '“And what did you think?”', '“I thought, ‘Why did I just smuggle a dirty rock out of a museum because a crazy person wanted me to?’ And then I looked more closely at the cuts. Saw they were marks. So maybe it’s art, right? And the marks are some kind of abstract expression. That was my first instinct.” She made a face, discounting her own theory. “Right. So a scientist as renowned as Dr. Vivian Terrell would risk her career and her freedom over some artwork.”', '“Wait,” Danny said. “How’d you find her name?”', 'Shura answered his question. “I checked the museum employee roster on the tram ride back to Hawking. Wrist consoles are good for more than just texting, right? Anyway, her picture was right there on the website. Dr. Vivian Terrell specializes in Martian geology. Unmanned trawlers go to Mars all the time to get the minerals we need here. She’s in charge of analyzing whatever they bring back.”', '“Cool job,” Rachel broke in. This time, she was oblivious to Rez’s cold stare. Instinctively, Violet’s eyes glanced at the crook of Rachel’s elbow. She saw a small blue flash. Proof positive of just how excited the little girl was at the thought of Mars.', '“I read,” Rachel said, “that there’s evidence of a lost civilization there. An underground colony, maybe, that disappeared billions of years ago, in the same way that the dinosaurs had vanished from Old Earth a long, long time before human beings showed up.”', '“That whole Martian colony business—it’s pure speculation,” Rez said. His tone had a kind of sneering dismissal in it. From anybody else, the tone would’ve seemed mean, but they knew it was just Rez being Rez. He was focused, and a focused Rez was a formidable force. He wanted to get back to the rock. “So what do we know for sure?”', 'Violet replied, “Well, we know that somebody at the museum really, ', ' wants to keep the rock a secret. But why?”', '“Right—why?” Shura said. “I mean, trawlers bring minerals back from Mars all the time. Tons and tons of them. Why the fuss over this little thing?”', 'Rez summed it up. “Yeah. What’s the big deal about one rock?”', 'Danny stared at the rusty red object in the center of his coffee table. The markings covered every inch of it, traveling up and down and sideways. They looked as if they were trying to say something.', '“It can’t be just the rock,” he said. “It’s gotta be what’s ', ' the rock.”', '\\xa0* * *', 'They spent the rest of the morning trying to decipher the message. Using the TranslatePro app that Rez had created the year before for their wrist consoles, they ran the markings through every language database they could find. There were 26,347 languages and dialects available on the app. The languages came from the misty history of Old Earth as well as from the quirky new languages created in the early years of New Earth, including exotic computer codes.', 'Nothing worked.', 'The markings were not part of any known system of communication.', 'At noon they decided to take a break. They were tired and frustrated. Violet carefully placed the rock in her backpack, and she and Rez left for Protocol Hall. They stopped on their way to deposit Rachel at school. Rez’s story about a delayed tram transfer seemed to satisfy Rachel’s teachers, but the truth was, the teachers didn’t ask too many questions—probably because Rez was still admired at the school as the smartest student they’d ever had, with Rachel now running a close second, and the teachers still called him when they had technical issues with their consoles. Shura finally answered her mother’s texts and headed home. And Danny left his apartment right behind them. A mandatory meeting for all hands had been called at the police station.', 'It was night now. Violet had walked home from Protocol Hall through the dark, warm streets of New Earth. Her backpack, slung across one shoulder, had thumped rhythmically against her hip the whole way, keeping time with her steps. She had felt the rock’s presence close to her, buried securely in the backpack. She had stopped only once, to pick up a rock she saw by the side of the street. She looked at it, and she thought about the vast difference between this average, ordinary rock in her hand and the one in her backpack that had come all the way from Mars.', 'She and Rez hadn’t talked about the rock during their shift that afternoon. They needed to focus on their jobs. But they had all agreed to meet again tomorrow morning and bring any new ideas.', 'Violet stepped into the front hall of the apartment she shared with her father. She realized she had a choice to make. She hesitated in the threshold, fingering the strap of her backpack where it looped over her shoulder.', 'Should she tell him about what had happened at the museum?', 'Ogden Crowley shifted in his chair. He hadn’t heard her come in—his work always took his total attention—but all at once he sensed her presence. He looked up, turning his head so that he could see her.', '“Violet—hello, sweetheart. How was work?” That was always the first thing he said.', '“It was okay.” That was what she always said back to him.', 'And in the next instant, she made her decision. She wouldn’t tell her father about the rock. The omission created a sort of queasiness inside her. She wasn’t lying, exactly, but neither was she telling him the truth. Which was a kind of lie.', 'Wasn’t it?', 'If her mother were still alive, it would all be different. She could tell her mother the truth about ', '. Her mother would understand. Lucretia Crowley had been a rebel, too. She’d followed her conscience, even when that decision took her away from her family—and even, Violet thought, as the familiar lump formed in her throat, when it caused her mother’s death.', '“Violet? You’re frowning, sweetheart. What’s wrong?”', '“Nothing, Dad. Just tired. Long day at work.”', '“Okay,” her father said. “Well, get a good night’s sleep.” He held up a sheaf of papers and rattled it. “I’ll be working for a few more hours.”', 'Violet knew from experience that “a few more hours” really meant “all night.” He hardly ever slept these days.', '“Good night, Dad.”', '\\xa0* * *', 'Before she got in bed, Violet checked her console one last time. There was a message from Shura, telling her about a new painting she had started working on that night, and messages from two other friends, minor ones, passing along small tidbits of gossip: a breakup, a new job, an argument with parents that resulted in a weeklong grounding. Violet didn’t bother to answer those. Shura, Rez, and Danny were her core friends. Other people came and went in her life. And gossip bored her, especially when she had a delicious mystery to solve.', 'There was no message from Danny. Disappointing, but not surprising. You never get the message you are hoping for the most.', ' The thought took Violet by surprise. A more intense version of her feelings for Danny had sort of sneaked up on her. She dared herself to check the crook of her left elbow.', 'And there it was: a very tiny, very brief, but still visible flash of blue.', ', Violet thought. But the notion wasn’t altogether unpleasant. She had no idea what to do about it, and so she switched off the lamp next to her bed and turned on her side and scrunched up the pillow under her ear.', 'She didn’t close her eyes right away. At night her room glowed, but not from lamps. It glowed with the power of Shura’s paintings, six of which Violet had arranged around the edges of the room, leaning against the walls. Shura had given them to Violet as birthday and Christmas gifts over the years.', 'She couldn’t see the paintings, because there was no light, but she could feel them. And feeling, Violet had come to learn ever since she’d started living with her best friend’s art, was another kind of seeing.', 'Her thoughts returned to the rock, to those bizarre marks that didn’t match any existing language. Part of her wondered if maybe the marks meant nothing at all. Maybe it was just gibberish.', 'Maybe there really had been a civilization on Mars. And maybe a kid who lived there—', ', Violet thought—had been bored one day, just as bored as she and Shura were last night. And so to pass the time, maybe this Martian kid had sat down and carved a bunch of nonsense syllables on the side of a rock. Maybe that was it. And now, a few billion years later, Violet and her friends were trying to figure out something that couldn’t be figured out because it was . . . nothing. Some long-dead Martian kid’s idea of a joke.', 'She turned over on her other side and brought her knees up to her chest, trying to find a comfortable position so that sleep would come.', 'Somehow the Martian-kid-with-a-chisel-and-a-lousy-sense-of-humor theory didn’t sound right. The writing on the rock ', ' to have a meaning. It just had to.', 'She flopped onto her back again. She couldn’t settle down. Her thoughts were spinning too quickly.', 'She’d checked her console earlier, and found out that Mars might have had an atmosphere four billion years ago, give or take a few million years. An atmosphere could mean life. And life could mean—people. But if it ', ' a four-billion-year-old language, how would she and her friends ever be able to translate the—', 'Her console beeped.', 'She sat up in bed and snatched it off her nightstand. ', ', she thought. The excitement made her feel like she’d swallowed a hyperactive butterfly.', 'Her heart sank a little when she saw the caller ID:', 'It was Rez.', '“Hey,” Violet said.', 'He didn’t bother with a greeting, which was Pure Rez. Greetings were for lesser minds.', '“She did it.”', '“What?”', '“', '.” Rez was practically shouting. Violet turned down the volume level on her console. She didn’t want her father to know she was still up.', '“Who did what?” Violet said.', '“Rachel. She solved it. She knows what the rock is all about.”', '“What? How did a kid—”', '“I don’t know. But she did it. She cracked the code.”', '“So what do the marks mean?”', '“I don’t know that, either.”', '“You don’t—”', '“', '” Rez’s voice sounded hoarse with frustration. “She won’t tell me.”', 'Now Violet was thoroughly confused, but she was still elated. Somebody had translated the writing on the rock—even if it ', ' a seven-year-old.', ' ', '“Um, Rez?” Violet said, trying to keep the skepticism out of her tone. “How do you know if—well, if Rachel is telling you the truth? I mean—kids lie sometimes. And this is pretty farfetched. How do you know she really did it?”', 'Rez snorted into the phone. “Be', ',” he said, “she’s ', ' sister. And that means she’s brilliant.”', 'But he had a point.', '“So what do we do?” she asked. “How do we get Rachel to talk?”', '“Oh, she’ll talk. Just not to ', '.” Rez sighed deeply. “She says she’ll only tell one person.”', '“Who?”', '“You.”', '“Why me?” Violet said.', '“She said you were nice to her this morning. When we were at Danny’s. ', '.” He made a noise in the back of his throat, scoffing at the word.', '“And she won’t change her mind.”', 'Rez laughed. He didn’t laugh often—Violet could only recall two other times when he’d done so much as chuckle—and it surprised her. She liked his laugh.', '“Hey—one more time, she’s ', ' sister. Given that fact, what do you think the chances are she’ll change her mind?”', '“Zero.”', '“Bingo.”', '“So what do we do next?”', '“There’s no ‘we’ here, Violet. Rachel wants to meet with you alone. Can I bring her over to your place?”', '“Your parents are okay with you taking her out this late?”', '“They’re not home. I’m in charge. My dad’s got a big project over in L’Engletown. And my mom’s doing site work for a new tower in Mendeleev Crossing.”', '“Okay,” Violet said. “I’ll think of something to tell my dad. Come on over.”', '“He’s still up? It’s almost midnight.”', '“Oh, yeah.” She could see, in the line under her closed bedroom door, the light from the living room lamp. “He’s up. Like always.”', '\\xa0* * *', '“So—Dad,” Violet said. “Rez and his little sister need a place to hang out for a few hours. There’s a lot of noise in their building. That’s okay, right?”', 'Her father murmured an affirmative. He didn’t look up from the massive pile of papers in his lap. Violet could’ve told him that aliens from a zombie planet were making peanut-butter-and-brain sandwiches in the kitchen and he would’ve muttered, ', '.', 'A few minutes later Rez and Rachel arrived. They’d had to get through the gauntlet of guards that protected the presidential residence, an experience that left Rez irked. Violet shrugged. Nothing she could do about it. She led Rez into her father’s library and patted the seat of a big comfy armchair. Rez had already summoned a book on his console and in two seconds was deep into his reading.', 'Violet and Rachel settled down in Violet’s bedroom. They sat on the bed, in the middle of the messed-up sheets, facing each other with the rock between them. Rachel was in her pajamas; Rez had simply bundled her up in a jacket and hustled her out of their apartment.', '“So,” Violet said. She pointed to the rock. “You figured out the message.”', 'Rachel nodded. Her hair was matted on one side. There was a dried cereal stain on the sleeve of her pajamas. She was clearly tired, but her eyes, while ringed with dark circles, were still bright.', '“What I don’t understand,” Violet added, gently probing, “is how you did that without looking at the rock again. I’ve had it since we left Danny’s apartment.”', '“Yeah,” Rachel said. “But I’d already seen it.”', '“Once.”', '“That’s all I needed.”', ', Violet thought. ', '. An eidetic memory was a given.', 'Violet was trying to be patient, but she felt as if she was going to burst wide open unless she got right to it. “Okay, Rachel. So what do the words on the rock mean?”', '“They’re not words.”', '“They’re not?”', '“Nope.” Rachel had pulled up one leg of her pajamas, exposing her knee. She started to pick at a scab there.', 'Violet could barely contain herself. “If they’re not words—then what ', ' they? And what does the message mean?”', '“They’re musical notes. And lyrics. It’s not a message—it’s a song.”', '\\xa0* * *', 'Later, Violet would be struck by the exquisite simplicity of it. And by the fact that when you think you know what you’re looking for—like a message made purely out of words—you’re pretty much guaranteed not to find it. You have to look without expectations. And with new eyes.', 'The eyes of a seven-year-old.', '“When I first went to bed tonight,” Rachel said, “I couldn’t sleep. I kept picturing the rock. It was like those markings were stamped on my brain. And then I realized that there were twelve unique symbols—and another twelve that seemed to be slight variations of the original twelve. These twenty-four marks were arranged in different patterns across the rock.', '“Twelve and twenty-four. Twelve and twenty-four.” Rachel’s eyes were bright. “The numbers sort of danced around in my head. I knew them from somewhere. I was ', ' of it. And then it hit me. There are twelve musical notes—A, B, C, D, E, F, G and then five sharps and flats that fit between the five. That makes twelve. You add the minor scale—twelve plus twelve—and that makes twenty-four. Those are the building blocks of all music. It’s the alphabet of song. I don’t know what instrument a Martian would’ve played it on—but it’s a song. Music is music. Notes are notes. Sounds are sounds. Doesn’t matter if they were written down a few billion years ago or last week. Doesn’t matter if they come from Mars or Neptune or Pluto. A song is a song.”', '“So it’s just a melody,” Violet said. She was disappointed. “No words.”', 'Rachel gave her a puzzled frown. “', ' there are words. I’ve been singing the song in my head the whole way over here.”', 'Violet was now excited beyond belief. She didn’t need to look down at her own left arm to see the quick blue flash. She felt the hot crackle.', '“How’d you translate it?” she asked Rachel eagerly. “How’d you figure out what the words mean?”', '“The same way people have been cracking codes forever,” Rachel replied. Unlike Rez, she didn’t sound snobby and superior. She sounded earnest. “You look for patterns. Repetitions. For instance, if you see a certain symbol showing up in a certain spot more often than other symbols—and if it’s followed by another symbol more often than by any other symbol, you can start to make words. Deduce meanings. The truth is,” she said, somewhat sheepishly, “code-breaking isn’t really about breaking codes. It’s about probability theory.”', '“Not following,” Violet admitted.', '“Okay. Let’s take the English language. Once you know the probability of each letter being used in a sentence, you can break pretty much any code. ‘E’ is the letter used most often. So you look for a symbol that’s used a lot. Chances are, it’s an ‘E.’ Then you start factoring in the probabilities of which letters would follow an ‘E.’ And you go from there.”', '“But this isn’t English. It’s ', '.”', 'Rachel shook her head. “Doesn’t matter. Math is math. Probability is probability. Clusters and juxtapositions of symbols, points and counterpoints—it all started to make sense. I got the chorus first and then the verses. There are a ', ' of verses.” She sighed. “If I’d had a computer handy I could’ve figured it out much faster. But my mom doesn’t let me take a computer to bed. She says I won’t be able to settle down. So I had to run the numbers in my head. Thousands of calculations. It took me over an ', '.”', '“A whole hour? What a ', '.” Violet grinned. Then she picked up the rock. Back to work. “Show me.”', 'Rachel pointed to a squiggle. “This is the title. Now, it would’ve been easier if she’d just called it ‘The Song of Scaptur,’ but they didn’t call their songs ‘songs.’ They called them ‘tablets.’ She called this one ‘The Tablet of Scaptur.’ ”', '“‘She’?”', '“Scaptur. I think she was a kid. She lived on Mars four billion years ago. That’s the date on the songbook—four billion years ago. She liked to solve puzzles just like me. It’s all there on the Tablet. She has a little section at the beginning where she sings about herself. And after that,” Rachel said, frowning, “the song gets really serious. I think that doctor at the museum knew what the song said. The one who gave you the rock. The scientist. But she probably made a mistake—she told the other people at her workplace. And they wanted to take the rock from her. So she ran. They caught her—but not before she gave it to you.”', 'Violet was trying to act casual, but she was so excited that she was almost vibrating. She had to make herself settle down so that she could speak. She didn’t need to look at her left elbow; she knew her chip was sparking like crazy.', '“What does the song say?”', 'The little girl’s frown deepened. She started to pick at the scab again.', '“Do I have to tell you? It’s kind of sad.”', 'Violet tried to tamp down her surging impatience. She’d done a little babysitting, and she knew that dealing with kids could be a pain in the butt.', '“I really wish you’d share it with me,” Violet said.', '“Okay.” Rachel nodded. “The song is about what happened on Mars. A long, long time ago. The planet was in big trouble. There were wars. All the time. And a lot of people died. But the saddest thing is that they did just what your dad did. They built a city. Up in the sky. Right over the planet.”', '“But that’s a ', ' thing. Why would it be sad?”', 'Rachel’s voice lost its brightness. “Because it didn’t work.”', 'Violet was stunned. “What do you mean?”', '“That’s what the song says. Scaptur wrote it from inside a cave that was way, way, ', 'down below the surface of the planet. Everybody else was gone. She was all alone.” Rachel swallowed hard. “New Mars failed. After a few centuries the whole thing came crashing down onto Old Mars and people were killed. Millions of them. They thought the new world was going to last forever—but it didn’t.” The little girl blinked. “Do you think that’s what will happen to New Earth? Will we go crashing down, too?”', 'Before Violet could reply, her console chirped. The caller ID made her take a deep breath. She hated to interrupt Rachel, but she had to answer it.', 'It was Dr. Vivian Terrell.', '\\xa0* * *', '“Violet Crowley?”', '“Yeah.”', 'A long, ragged sigh from the caller. “Good. It’s really you. I’m in hiding, but I’ve been trying to track you down. When I gave you the Tablet yesterday at the museum, I didn’t know who you were. I only knew I couldn’t let them have it. I owed it to Scaptur to keep it out of their hands.”', ', Violet thought. ', '. So Rachel was right. Dr. Terrell had figured it out, too. She knew that the odd markings weren’t just words. They were song lyrics.', '“How did you find me?” Violet asked. She looked at Rachel; the little girl was fiddling with her scab again.', '“One of my colleagues—he’s on my side, but they don’t know he is—saw you and your friend as you were running from the museum. He scanned the pictorial data base. My God—you’re Ogden Crowley’s daughter! What are the odds that I’d end up giving the Tablet to the child of my worst enemy?”', '“', '” Violet said, instantly defensive. “No way. My dad loves the museum. It was his idea to ', 'it.”', '“He may love the museum, my dear, but he’s not too crazy about the research division right now.” Terrell gave a low, bitter chuckle. “If he had his way, I’d be on a one-way trip to Old Earth. I ought to hang up—but I can’t. Because you have what I need. I’ve got to trust you.”', '“Look, my father isn’t such a bad—”', '“Never mind,” Terrell said, cutting her off. “Can you meet me somewhere? Talking on a console isn’t really safe.”', 'Violet hesitated. She didn’t know this person. And based on what Terrell had said about her father, she wasn’t sure that she wanted to.', 'But she really, ', 'wanted to know more about the Tablet of Scaptur.', 'She had to know why people were so afraid of a small red rock.', '“Okay,” Violet said. “Where?”', '“The foundry,” Terrell said. “And make sure you bring it.”', 'Terrell had probably chosen that location because it was deserted at night.', '“Okay,” Violet said.', '“And come alone.”', 'Violet took less than a second to make her decision. “I can’t do that.” She looked over at Rachel. If anybody deserved to be part of the action, it was this little girl. Yes, it might be perilous. And Violet knew she’d never forgive herself if something bad happened to Rachel. But she’d ', 'never forgive herself if she didn’t take her along. Rachel had figured out the Tablet. She deserved to be part of this adventure, no matter how dangerous it might prove to be.', '“What do you mean?” Terrell said.', '“I’m bringing a friend.”', '\\xa0* * *', 'The road leading to the foundry was wide, dark, and scary. Large shapes hunched ahead of them, spaced out across the night-drenched horizon; these shapes were the giant vats in which super-heated liquid roiled and churned. Violet had visited here a few times with her father, when he was inspecting the infrastructure of New Earth. He had explained to her about the immense heat and how it reduced machine parts to a seething red goo, out of which brand new parts could be created. The foundry, she had often thought, was a perfect symbol of New Earth itself: A place where the old became new again, the physical embodiment of a second chance.', 'If only it wasn’t so shadowy and bleak.', 'Violet held Rachel’s hand as they walked. She pretended it was for Rachel’s benefit but it was really for her own. She felt goosebumps popping up along her arms, even though the autumn air wasn’t cold. She wondered if she should’ve called Shura or Danny for backup.', '. She had made the right decision. This was her mission—hers and Rachel’s.', 'It had been hard enough to keep Rez from coming with them. Before they left she’d sent him a text from her bedroom, explaining that she needed to check something at Protocol Hall. She and Rachel would be back very soon.', ', Rez had texted back. Naturally.', ', Violet had replied, her thumbs flying madly over the console keyboard. ', 'And then she and Rachel had slipped out of the apartment through the side door, Violet in her T-shirt and jeans, Rachel in her pajamas and jacket. Violet had long ago perfected her technique for eluding her father’s security detail.', 'They boarded a twenty-four-hour tram for Farraday. A few minutes later they arrived at Foundry Road, a wide dirt pathway marked by the crisscrossing tire tracks of enormous vehicles. The road ended at the foot of one of the giant, open-topped vats. The heat from the churning liquid within it seemed to seep out of the sides in invisible tendrils.', 'The only light came from the uprushing glow of the molten steel as it moved restlessly in the vats. Sometimes an especially big wave heaved and then splashed down in a flurry of red-gold sparks, casting a magnificent radiance that temporarily lit up the foundry yard.', '“Over here.”', 'The whisper startled Violet. She flinched so violently that the backpack she was wearing almost slid off her shoulder.', 'Dr. Vivian Terrell slipped out of the shadows. She was wearing the same clothes she had been wearing the night before, when Violet first saw her in the corridor of the museum. But those clothes were wrinkled now, and torn in some places. Her hair was even wilder than it had been before—which Violet would have sworn was impossible.', '“How did you get away from the guards?” Violet asked.', 'Terrell smiled. “I’m old, my dear, but I’m nimble. They locked me in my office while they waited for instructions about what to do with me—and I climbed out the window.” Her eyes narrowed. She looked suspiciously at Rachel. “Who’s this?”', '“My friend,” Violet said. “She figured out the rock, too. The Tablet of Scaptur.”', 'Terrell was surprised. “That’s impossible. It took me almost two months of work and a dozen of our most powerful computers to—” She shook her head. “Okay, so it must be true. Otherwise you wouldn’t even know what to call it.” She gave Rachel a rueful smile. “How old are you, kid?”', '“Seven.”', '“', '.” Terrell sighed. “All right, then. Give me the Tablet.”', 'Violet made no move to retrieve it from her backpack.', '“Come on,” Terrell said impatiently. She held out her hand, palm up. “This has gone on long enough. The Tablet—I need it ', '.”', '“I have some questions first,” Violet said.', '“Make it fast. We don’t have a lot of time.”', '“How did the Tablet get to New Earth?”', 'Terrell shrugged. “The best I can figure is that the rock got stuck in the treads of one of the Mars trawlers. All I know is that when the trawler was being unloaded, it fell out. One of the workers saw it and brought it to the museum. Nobody knew what the markings meant. Not until I got hold of it, that is.” Her voices glinted with pride. This was her field of expertise. “Sometimes, objects that are buried very, very deep will gradually work their way up to the planet surface. It can take millions and millions of years.”', '“Once you figured out that the marks were a song, and what that song meant,” Violet said, “who did you tell?”', '“My supervisor. That’s when all the trouble started,” Terrell declared. “Next thing I knew, my colleague texted me that a bunch of armed guards were coming for me down that corridor. I tried to get away—you saw that part—but they grabbed me. I was lucky to be able to keep the Tablet away from them the way I did. I still can’t believe you happened to be there.” She held out her palm again. “But I want it back. It’s mine.”', '“Two more questions.”', 'Terrell rolled her eyes. “What is it with you, anyway? Your little friend has already told you what the song says. Why does it matter who’s after the Tablet? Or why?”', '“Two more. Or no deal.”', '“Fine. Two more. But that’s it. I’ve got to get out of here. They’re probably coming closer every minute.”', 'Violet put an arm around Rachel’s shoulder. The little girl had trembled slightly; Violet had seen the movement of her small body and wanted to comfort her, to gather her in.', '“Who did your supervisor tell?” Violet said. She was stalling, reluctant to ask her real question: ', '“I can’t tell you for sure,” the woman replied, “but given the number of guards they sent—I think it’s a pretty good bet that somebody pretty important knows.”', '. It was so disappointing to think about—to imagine her father authorizing a relentless hunt for an old lady. Being part of a cover-up.', '“And the last thing I need to know,” Violet went on, “is why.”', '“Why what?”', '“Why do they want you to hand over the Tablet? Why are they hunting you down? Why don’t they want anybody to know about it?”', 'Terrell hesitated. She licked her lips. Violet realized that the woman was probably thirsty—and hungry, too—from her effort to elude the security guards.', '“To begin with,” Terrell answered, “that’s really ', ' questions, not one—but I’ll let it slide. It’s been a long night.” She licked her lips again. “Look. The authorities have to keep the Tablet a secret. They don’t want the people of New Earth to know about the song. They want us to believe that New Earth marks the very first time anybody has tried this—the experiment of elevating a new civilization over an old, dying one.” She laughed a hard, cold laugh. “Well—guess what? The Martians ', ' try it. Billions of years ago. That’s what Scaptur’s song is all about. It’s about the dream of a new life—a dream that became a nightmare. Because New Mars didn’t work. Oh, it worked for a while—but then it disintegrated. New Mars fell apart. It crumbled from its own weight. The song tells the story.” She took a deep breath. “Shouldn’t the people of New Earth have all the facts? Shouldn’t they know what they’re in for? Shouldn’t they hear the song?”', 'Violet thought for a moment. “It might just be a fable.”', 'Terrell frowned. “If it’s just a fable, then why are the New Earth authorities so determined to hush me up? Something tells me they already know—or maybe they just have a good hunch—that somewhere else, right here in our very own solar system, this solution was tried before. Suspending a new world over an existing one. So—look, Violet. I need you to give me the Tablet. Without it, I’m just a nut with a crazy theory. But the Tablet proves my story—that there was once a New Mars. Just like New Earth. And New Earth may suffer the same fate as New Mars.”', 'A wave of supernova-hot liquid in a nearby vat heaved up in a glittering curl and then fell back again, creating a cloud of steam and a corona of light that hissed and flared against the night sky. Terrell seemed to tremble at the proximity of the heat, a heat that could dissolve human flesh every bit as quickly as it liquefied steel and iron.', '“Okay,” she said. “Come on. It’s time. Give me the Tablet.”', 'Violet didn’t move. The Intercept, she knew, was collecting her emotion and filing it away. Fortunately Terrell didn’t know what that emotion was.', '“Give me the Tablet,” the woman repeated.', 'Violet continued to stand there. She still didn’t reach into her backpack. Instead she shifted the strap further up on her shoulder. “I can’t.”', '“What do you mean you can’t? People deserve to know that New Earth might fail.”', '“Anything can fail,” Violet said. “But if the Tablet’s song is made public, people will believe that it ', ' fail. That it’s somehow ordained. Predestined. That there’s no hope.”', '“Give me the Tablet,” Terrell said for a third time. Her voice was harsh and urgent now. “', '”', 'In a flash, Violet’s hand dived inside her backpack. She pulled out the rock. Gripping it, summoning every bit of strength she had, she tossed it up in a high, wide arc, aiming for the vat. The Tablet of Scaptur looked as if it might not make it over the rim—but a brief wash of phosphorescent bubbles splashed up, proving that it had landed inside the vat, there to be instantly melted down by the cataclysmic heat.', '“', '” Terrell cried out, the word rising into a shriek. She had lunged toward Violet as the rock was flung aloft, but missed snatching it back by inches.', 'Now that it was over, Violet pulled Rachel away from the woman, to keep her safe. But there was no need. Terrell wasn’t dangerous. She was filled with grief, not fury.', '“Why did you ', ' that?” Terrell said in a sorrowful voice. “It’s gone now. No one will know the fate that may await New Earth—the same fate that befell New Mars.”', '“Exactly—the fate that ', ' await us,” Violet countered. “Not the fate that ', ' await us. If Scaptur’s song is sung, people will lose heart. Quit trying. And that will ', ' that we follow in the footsteps of New Mars.”', '“You’ve destroyed a piece of history,” Terrell said. She almost wailed the words.', '“I ', ' to. We live by our dreams—my father taught me that—and if dreams are taken away, then hope goes away, too. Don’t you see? Doubts can doom New Earth faster than anything—faster than a failure of the wind turbines or a glitch in the gravitational balancing apparatus. A loss of hope would be more catastrophic than a direct hit by an asteroid.', '“All that kept my father alive during his dark, terrible days on Old Earth,” Violet went on, “was hope. Hope fueled by dreams. And then he used those dreams to make New Earth. Other people deserve to have dreams, too. Right?”', 'Terrell didn’t seem to be listening. By now she had wandered away from them, head down, muttering to herself. She might have even been weeping. Soon she vanished in the darkness that pooled between the giant vats. The geologist would, Violet assumed, return to her job at the museum. She was surely safe from the retribution of the authorities—because to accuse her of stealing the Tablet would be to admit that the Tablet had existed in the first place.', '“Come on,” Violet said to Rachel. “Let’s get you home. You’ve got school tomorrow.”', 'The two of them trudged slowly back toward the tram stop.', '“She’s right, you know,” Rachel said.', '“What do you mean?”', '“Dr. Terrell. What she said about history. You destroyed it. Forever.”', '“Did I?”', 'Rachel stopped.', 'Violet stopped, too. She looked around carefully in all directions, making sure they weren’t being observed. Then she drew an object from her backpack. It was covered with red marks.', '“This,” Violet said, “is the real Tablet of Scaptur. What I threw in the vat just now was an ordinary rock. I picked it up in the street today.” She could trust Rachel. She didn’t know how she knew that—but she did.', 'Astonished, Rachel blinked her eyes several times before she was able to speak. “The things you talked about back there—the dreams,” the little girl said. “And about how the Tablet’s song would make people lose hope and—” She paused to catch her breath.', '“That’s all true,” Violet said. “No one will ever hear its song. I can’t let them.”', '“But why didn’t you just get rid of it back there?”', 'The road was dark, yet each time a giant wave of molten steel rose and fell in the mammoth vats behind them, their faces were briefly lit up by the golden glow. Rachel’s expression was one of confusion. Confusion was an unlikely state for this kid. ', ', Violet thought, recalling the girl’s stunning brilliance, her ability to solve every problem set before her.', 'Except, apparently, this one.', '“I don’t know, Rachel. I don’t know why, but I couldn’t destroy the Tablet. I just . . . couldn’t. But I ', ' couldn’t let Dr. Terrell know that it still exists, because she’d always be trying to get it. And once she had it, she’d tell the people of New Earth what the song said—which would hurt my dad. Undermine everything he’s worked for.”', 'Violet didn’t say so to Rachel, but more and more these days, she had begun to have similar doubts about the Intercept. She wasn’t sure it should exist—but she couldn’t be against it, either. Not openly. She wouldn’t go against her father.', 'But was it right for the government to keep a record of everyone’s feelings? Shouldn’t feelings be ', '? Ogden Crowley said the Intercept kept New Earth safe. Did that make it right?', 'Violet reached down and slung an arm around Rachel’s shoulder. They started moving again toward the tram stop.', '“Time to go home,” Violet said.', 'The Tablet of Scaptur, she realized, was the first big secret she had ever kept from her father.', 'And then she realized something else. She didn’t know how she knew, but she knew: It wouldn’t be the last.', '\\xa0', 'Copyright © 2017 by Julia Keller', '\\nArt copyright © 2017 by Micah Epstein']}\n"

A tiny story, covered in green fur or lichen, shaky on its legs. It fit in the palm of my hand. I stared at the story for a long time, trying to understand. The story had large eyes that could see in the dark, and sharp teeth. It purred, and the purr grew louder and louder: a beautiful flower bud opening and opening until I was filled up. I heard the thrush and pull of the darkness, grown so mighty inside my head.', 'I grew weary.', 'I grew weary and I fell asleep on the couch holding the story, wondering what it might be and who had delivered it to me. But there was no time left for wonder. As I slept, the story gnawed its way into my belly and then the story crawled up through my body into my head. When I woke, gasping my resistance, the story made me stumble out the door of my house and lurch through the dark down my street, giddy and disoriented, muttering, “Do not stop me. Do not stop me. Story made me this way. Story made me this way.”', 'I felt a compulsion to turn to the left, and then to turn to the left again. Until the story made me stop at the end of the block, where the last fence meets a forest. By now I knew that the story wasn’t a story at all. It had just made me think it was a story so it could invade my brain.', 'And while I stood there in the shadows of the moonless night, beyond the street lamps, beyond the circling moths and with the nighthawks gliding silent overhead…while I stood there and pleaded, the story-creature sprouted out of the top of my skull in a riot of wildflowers, goldenrod, and coarse weeds.', 'The explosion smashed through me. I screamed out, but the story-creature clamped down on my throat and the scream turned into a dribble of whispered nonsense rhymes in a code that crawled across my skin and inside my mouth. My head itched and there was an uncomfortable weight so my balance was off. But somehow it felt right.', 'Even the midnight bumblebees circling my head like a halo felt right, or the things like bumblebees that had erupted from my skin, my mouth.', 'There were so many things I had already begun to forget.', '\\xa0', 'I am a writer…I was a writer. It is easy to fool a writer into thinking a creature is a story. The doorbell had rung earlier. When I had opened the door, a bulky little envelope lay on the welcome mat, under the glow of the porch light. When I opened it, a booklet crawled out onto the kitchen table. The booklet smelled like moist banana bread. It was filled with strange words, but somehow I understood that language. I read the booklet from cover to cover like it was a wonderful meal and I was a starving man. I devoured every word.', 'I had read a story. I was sure of it, even though I couldn’t remember what the story had been about. Nor could I recall who else had been with me in the house, except that there were two of them and they had become mere shadows on the wall.', 'Now, by the fence, the wildflowers and goldenrod and the weeds twined together and became something else and roots splayed out into me, and atop my head grew a sapling. My balance was terrible—I had to hold the sapling with both hands because I knew that if the sapling snapped it would kill me. But soon the weight would be unsupportable. Soon I would be beyond repair.', 'The story-creature that had sprouted from my head was restless and had tasks to accomplish. So I plunged deep into the forest in the dark of night, raging across the paths there, smashing into trees, backtracking, unable to know where I was or trying to wrest control from the thing that wanted to control me. But soon I adhered to paths despite myself. Soon I cohered and came to know balance and lifted my hands from the atrocity jutting from my crown. Soon I walked smooth and slow and no root tripped me and no false trail fooled me. I could see in the dark by then, or It could, and what, really, by then was the difference?', 'By dawn and the calls of birds, I recognized, through the grayness, the side of a hill and a clearing and there I turned once more to the left and pitched face-first into the grass and dirt and crawling beetles. The story-creature’s roots plunged greedily through my brain and through my soft palate and through my lower jaw, seeking the soil. While above me the swaying sapling had become a young tree. Or had taken on the appearance of a tree. It could never have been a tree.', 'I lay there, face-planted, with some ', ' growing through me and I let It soak up inspiration from the earth and from the air and from the new sun. I was awash in dreams of chlorophyll and photosynthesis…', 'We lay like that for a long time until the story-creature had used all of me It needed. Then It withdrew, and cared not how harsh that might be, for even in that short time I had become dependent, and the retreat was like screaming against an addiction. A hole had been left behind and my consciousness ached and jumped through the\\xa0hole again and again like it led to hell or to nothing, and all my atoms frayed at the edges or spread out wide, or seemed to, and I did not know if I was dead-alive or just dead.', 'My left leg was a withered thing now, a wet pant leg wrung out to dry, and my left arm I left in the soil—it broke off when I tried to rise, and the stump refused to bleed but after the snap became just like an old rotting tree branch. I think I carried it around with me, waving it around with my other arm, like something demented and foolish and out of date.', 'I was in the world but I was not in the world, endless and numb yet in agony.', 'I was shooting through an empty sky with the stars all fallen to the ground, and every star cut whatever it touched, including me, and all the stars that fell touched me.', 'I could not stop reaching out to make contact even though it made so little difference to my fate.', '\\xa0', 'I did not wake for one hundred years. This was truth.', 'This is the truth.', 'When I woke, a century had passed and the hillside had folded in itself and become overgrown with vines and the story-creature appeared to have long left and perhaps passed on its message to others and now beyond the hill lay a vast and unyielding desert and facing me on the fertile side, my withered leg pointing at it, was a waterhole from which drank any number of disquieting animals. They held shapes my eyes did not want to recognize although some held no real shape at all, but I knew they were other story-creatures and had spread more than one story.', 'Some I could only see out of the corner of my eye. Others had the right number of legs but no symmetry and trailed across the ground at odd angles, drawing deep lines in the mud. They snorfled and snuffled and grunted at the waterhole. They fought and died there, too, raising tusks and claws and fangs, and turned the edge of the water to a bloody froth…only to come back to life and forget a moment later their conflict.', 'The sun above seemed strange, as if it came to me through a filter, but I found that my eyes had a film over them that created a slight orange tint. I did not know how it came to be there, but it seemed protective or at least not unfriendly.', 'With help from a dead tree branch I could hobble along, and I made my way past the waterhole into the remnants of the forest, back into my neighborhood. Overhead the things that flew should not have been able to fly, for they did not really have wings; they just had the suggestion of wings, like some careless creator had not drawn them in right. My mind made them into insects, because my mind wanted stories it could understand, stories that\\xa0would not frighten it. But still I knew my mind was tricking me, and for a second I loved my mind for the deception.', 'My old street, which I felt I had left just hours before, lay in ruins. The pavement had not just cracked but become so overgrown it had no agency, left hardly any impression and my memory had to place it there—along with street lamps that now were just nubs of concrete columns that stood little higher than a foot tall. Among the houses of my neighborhood all roofs had been staved in and few walls remained and even of foundations there were only a handful in evidence.', 'One of those belonged to my home, and because I had had a basement, that is where I retreated to. I slid with relief into that space, which was flood damaged and filled with debris and overgrown with grass and vines and much worse things but still provided shelter. I slid into that space on the strength in one arm and one leg and I stared up at the sky until the things that must be messages but were also creatures curling through the air, written there and then dispersed, tormented me too much.', 'I dug into the dirt and grime, bereft. I dug there searching for my past, for something that had once curled around my wrist, for people that I had known but now existed like a reflection in murky water. Why were they no longer there? How could I no longer know them? Their rooms had been there. Their lives had been here. And were no longer.', '“It was just a story,” I croaked, and lapped from a dirty pool of water I was so thirsty.', 'This was a mistake because in that water were still more fragments of story like the one that had been left in an envelope on my doorstep. Phrases and words that were neither phrases nor words absorbed into me and changed me even more, so that my withered leg became a kind of thick, flat tail and of my two eyes nothing remained but in their place were several eyes, but only one of them could see in the regular way and the others looked across the sedimentary layers before me in that basement and saw the past and all the changes that had been wrought, and because I could not accept the mighty judgment and wrath of that, for a time I rebelled and I shut all of my eyes but the regular one.', 'Thus I squinted at the world that it might look more like the regular world, the one in which I had been a writer and not believed in God and lived alone in a house writing and thinking that being written meant one thing when it meant so many other things as well.', '\\xa0', 'The world as it had become held a strangeness too vast for me to understand. I could only comprehend the space mapped by the edges of the basement and so I lay there, hungry and thirsty, for three days and three nights and watched the passage of time as would a rock or a scorpion or a blade of grass. The clouds were curious and not as I remembered and they did not form shapes that I could recognize but shapes I didn’t recognize that were still recognizable as something, even if that ', ' was beyond me.', 'This troubled me greatly, more than most of my situation, and the way too that the clouds seemed to ', ' something now, that they were looking down at me and that they ', ' me. I did not like this, and this fact was how I came to know that the past was irretrievable. For some part of me had thought, perhaps, that all I saw might be undone, be unraveled. That I might recover my true sight and my old home and go back to when the story creature lay in an envelope on my porch and that if only I never brought it inside all of the new-terrible would go away, be put back in some kind of box, perhaps even into my brain.', 'But it could not be put back.', '\\xa0', 'After three days and nights, I sensed the approach of unlikely kin, although the sound of Its passage was unfamiliar. But still, the story-creature that had sprouted from my head, now a century older, leaned in to look down upon me and unfolded Itself before me and in all ways and throughout all times looked down upon me and unfolded Itself before me and kept unfolding and I could not stop It from doing so.', 'Even though I wanted to so badly.', 'Even though I would have\\xa0given anything for the story-creature to go away or to stop doing what It was doing, because I had lost so much already and this new world could not replace that.', 'But still the story-creature revealed Itself to me, until I understood that now It covered every surface, every space, and even though I thought I had been alone down in the basement among the rat-things and the other things I wanted very much to be rats and weren’t…I had not been alone. The story-creature had always been there, silent beside me, breathing beneath me, waiting for me to wake to its presence, to understand where I really was. But I would never understand. How could I? I had not understood the story to begin with.', 'When the story-creature knew, when I revealed to It by my demeanor how much I did not understand, the story-creature made a sound like the wind through branches, although the wind through the new branches I had woken to sounded more like a throaty scream being choked off. So this was a sound like the old wind, a lullaby about the ancient times to soothe whatever swarmed and seethed within me, although that was not the problem. Not really. The story-creature bent low and protruded and, there entered into the basement, sack-like, still attached to the story-creature…another me.', 'I opened my mouth to shriek at the sight, but the sound came out of the mouth of the other me. A me that had been rewritten, so that it resembled me in some ways, down to the wrong eyes and the tail for a leg, but different in others, so that to look at this other me made me feel nausea and claustrophobia until my adjustment.', 'Unlike me all of its eyes were open—and they saw…so much. So much more than me. Except now those of my eyes that were closed saw what its eyes saw and I fell to the basement floor, unable to process so many incoming images and feelings.', 'For so long after, I came to understand, I would spend my days listening to part of my own story issue forth from the mouth of another, and still not understand all of that story.', '\\xa0', 'I had not been much part of the story of the world before my awakening and before the creature assigned myself to me. The story-creature told me I had lived alone. I had written alone. I had done odd jobs and been out of the house when I needed to be somewhere else. I had a car and I had a big wooded backyard and I listened to music and I complained about things like everyone else. I believe I talked to the neighbors just enough and I would go over to their houses for dinner on holidays, although I did not invite them over to our house. Others had lived in the house with me, though, stains upon the wall now, lost in the foundations, overtaken by the story-creature’s tale.', 'I knew only that I had killed people and buried them in my backyard. Bad people. People who needed to be ended. This is how I created my fictions.', 'I killed them by writing stories about them in which they died and taking the stories and crumpling up the pages. Then I would take a shovel and dig a hole and shove the pages in and cover them up with dirt. Then I would say a few words about their souls and refill the bird feeder or rake the leaves. Sometimes the people died in life and not just on the page. Sometimes they didn’t. But always after I buried the pages, my writing would be enriched.', 'I didn’t mind being eccentric in these ways. I didn’t mind not having a brother or having parents that I could not remember, and now a century, like I did not mind many things. But I minded having been given a brother by the story-creature. It might seem like a small thing in a way, since I had been asleep so long and lived in the basement of the foundations of a house that had rotted away decades ago.', 'It might seem like a tiny thing given the world had been colonized by the story-creature and its brethren and even the sun and the clouds had become so strange. But it was a large thing to me. My brother who was me stared at me and I became the receptor for so much that was alien to me. I would lurch to my feet and run around the basement because my brother willed it, while in my head I would see from my brother’s eyes some memory in which he had had to run. Or I would sit quiet as he had sat quiet or I would weep and it was because of some time he had wept. Until finally I realized he was downloading another story into my brain, his story, and soon enough I knew that while I had slept I had been copied and that my brother was almost a century old and been awake that whole time and now I was to become as like him as possible—and then I raged. I raged and smashed my skull against hard things because I did not want to know about the last hundred years or to be filled up with what might make me not myself. Or too much myself.', 'If I had still been able, I would have written a story about my brother dying and buried it in the backyard.', '\\xa0', 'The world is full of monsters and this brother forced upon me was one of them. Even though my brother could see I did not want any of what he brought me, he would not relent and I could not escape, found no way to cut the link, cut the wires, cut the bond—whatever it was that had formed between us, and anyway it is true the story-creature grew agitated or upset at my attempts and became even larger and more terrible and this made me cower and beg forgiveness.', 'So I suppose I must have wanted to live, even amid this horror.', 'And there came toward the end of this transfer, this overlay, another realization: that my brother was dying. He slumped there against the dirt wall and made odd quirky motions and hissing sounds. I do not think I was killing him. I think he was old and an imperfect vessel and he would have died anyway, without anyone knowing his life. I believe the story-creature thought it a mercy to give me his memories, to let me have so much information and not be so bewildered about the world around me.', 'But the memories remained separate from my own, would not mix. They just floated on the top and made me have to concentrate more to remember the old life, the time before the story-creature. They came in jumbled and not all fully formed at first. Instead, they huddled together and made sense slowly. So I was screaming and writhing and then was catatonic for a time, staring into the space where my brother slowly became deflated and desiccated and his face fell in on itself and one by one his eyes closed and rotted away, while his toes flinched and his one leg kicked, kicked, was still, and the tail writhed even after my brother was fully dead.', 'I should have been sad seeing myself die, but instead I experienced a kind of joy and my eye clusters had all flickered open again at once. Perhaps when I was killing people in the backyard I had hoped one day someone would do the same for me. Perhaps I rejected this version of myself that did not resemble the me who had received the fateful story-creature on his doorstep. Or maybe I was just thankful that the memory transfer had ceased like a dam had been built to contain a flood. It is so difficult to know exactly why I felt this way, nor why there was such jubilance when the story-creature opened an impossibly wide set of jaws that it had not had moments before and swallowed my brother’s body whole. Even though I sat at the bottom of the basement pit, I experienced a sensation of flight and lift, as if I too had been borne up by that jagged black maw.', 'Yet I was still catatonic, too, absorbing the memories and I lay there for a week becoming in part someone else, so that filaments and roots and vines grew over me and fed gently on my skin and even much later I would still have the faint scars of their affection as evidence of my time in that state.', 'When it was done, my brother lay corpse-like and yet not corpse at the bottom of the pit and I stood at the lip, staring down at him while all around the sunrise of purple and amber made the seeing difficult. But I could not repudiate him for most of him now resided inside of me—and because of my brother my leg had recovered and I could walk through the new landscape like I had been born to it.', '\\xa0', 'I headed west, and the story-creature did not follow. Perhaps I thought it would, but instead the story-creature swayed there, crooning soft to the not-corpse in the pit. The story-creature crooned so softly, and yet I heard that sound for so many miles on my journey. I heard it when I tried to sleep in a night that had blinding light hidden within it and the grunting passage of beasts for which I had no name.', 'I heard it when I was trudging through what my mind interpreted as jungle but was an entirely different story, and one I could not remain sane within if I had really seen it, even with my brother’s memories.', 'For I soon outstripped any place my fake plant brother had yet gone and the terrain became more floating than fixed, the ground covered with a thin stubble of vegetation while the clouds had come close above and turned sea-green and from them tumbled down a forest that hung wrong, the bird-things that were not birds stitching their way through that cover upside down. The smell came to me thick, in emerald mist, and often my forehead shoved up against the physical manifestation of the smell, which could be like mint or could be like a rotted, mossy animal body.', 'The leaves and branches itched the top of my skull and brushed my cheek and I tried not to look up too often for fear of what I might see, but also because I grew to be terrified that if I took in that topsy-turvy land I would lose my grip on gravity and, slow and inexorable, take my place up there, my feet glued to the cloud cover and my head hanging toward the ground stubble.', 'But also the ground stubble hid dangers, for some was not vegetable but more like animal, and less like irritant than like mouth. I would look for shadow on the stubble to know the difference and I would not take for granted either the boulder that might suddenly unroll itself into a beast like an enormous squat centipede, which did not want to eat me, but sent tiny versions of itself that lived in its skin to attach themselves to my skin while burbling like children.', 'These children wanted to relive my memories. These children, for their own purposes, wanted to know about the last century, to extract it from my skull. This extraction hurt like machetes so sharp and keen that when they passed through my body I might be bisected and trisected without feeling it until I fell away into two or three symmetrical parts. That is how it manifested as pain. That is what it was every time.', 'Yet I could not elude them, and they came in such regimented columns and also at such regular intervals did the living boulders open up to release their terrible bounty that over time I realized these were indeed schools of a kind and I had been set loose as a history lesson. The story-creature had not wanted me to understand the last century, but instead the rest of the world, which might not know everything. So I endured it better knowing this, that it was not random and they did not mean me harm, but inflicted it as a side effect of the learning. If I were to suffer, then at least let me suffer for a purpose. Although, of course, I would do best should I not suffer at all.', 'Soon, though, came the final dislocation, for I had not understood the true nature of the school-creature in the same way that I had not understood the story-creature. For, one day, I came to the edge of the cloud cover forest above and the stubble ground below and the way the horizon ahead zeroed to a large dot revealed the truth.', 'I had walked into the school-creature during one of the night hikes, when disoriented, and all of this time the sky-cloud above had been one edge of the creature and the ground another, a kind of gullet or intestine I had entered at one end—and I was about to jump out of the other. And by the mystery of how the world now worked, the entire entity had been itself moving along, so that when I climbed down the other end to the edge of a giant lake, I had the sense that I had traveled much farther than the distance demarked by the movement of my legs, the walking forward and forward still.', 'From the outside the school-creature resembled a giant, horizon-consuming fuzzy worm, for while its belly was flat and padded, all along its flanks and atop its blind head, moss and creepers entangled it and disguised it so that the education within could be clandestine and immersive and conducted by light and dark provided by the school creature and the school-creature alone.', 'I ran for my life then, for the school-creature picked up speed as if it had known I was disembarking but now had its route to follow. With a plunging relentlessness it dove into the giant lake, the whole amazing length and width of it, while I had sprinted as fast as I could for the side, barely leaping clear of being crushed, and then, after it had passed me, of being drowned, for the splash into the lake had sent a vast wave in my general direction and I sprinted as far inland as I could, and still I was buffeted by the water and washed this way and that, one arm trapped by a single-celled creature that kept calling out my name as if I had already told it my name, but… I had not.', 'Then I was drowning, pulled under the waves, and I held on to the single-celled creature like a life-preserver, even as I rebuffed its attack and screamed only in my mind for I was holding my breath and thrashing and yet somehow knew I would not drown if I only leaned on new skills, except that it was too unnatural and I would have drowned not for lack of air, but for lack of practice and because I could not understand what I had become or was becoming.', 'But there came a sigh and a surge and I dashed up on moss-covered rocks, battered, gulping air, still clinging to the single-cell that clung to me. It meant to end me. It meant to do that whether we were drowning or whether we sucked air, together.', 'There are some beasts that do not care where you are, or if things have changed, still they will attack. Even if that progress came slow, inexorable, for I could feel the cell of it merging with the cells of me, and I knew I could not give it the time.', '\\xa0', 'When the water receded, I could only extricate myself by causing harm, and while I did not want to do this, and indeed looked about me to make sure nothing and no person was watching—at least, as far as I could be sure—I battered the single-cell against a rock that was no doubt some other animal lying there dormant, until the single-cell bleated and let loose of me and, bleeding an ichor lighter than the air, floated off into the sky in tendrils and green blood slicks that gripped the sky with a kind of phantom intent.', 'The blood was beautiful escaping into the heavens; I could barely stand the beauty of it, and what that meant about me.', 'The single-cell, subdued by my attack and with nothing to tether it to the ground, soon followed its own blood up into the sky, leaving me to contemplate a harsh truth: I had become so acclimated to this new environment that until seeing blood drift away into the sky I had not realized the thickness of the atmosphere of this new Earth. It was viscous, it rippled, and it could not, in a sense, be called air, although as I observed the edge of the giant lake, having returned now that the wave had passed, I could tell that water still was heavier than air, even if the composition of both had changed.', 'From that point on, I became aware of my breathing and how, although I had no visible gills, my lungs must in some way work different than before. That my weight or my walking must anchor me different. This awareness, creating a confusion like unwanted stereo in my head, made it hard to walk and to breathe without recognizing the effort. It was as if I had all of a sudden become a passenger in a machine body that I was expected to pilot without the seamlessness of before. It was like being transformed from a dolphin to a human upon reaching the midpoint of a swim across a dark and endless ocean.', 'As painful as it had been before—my brother’s memories, the trisection extracted from me for the school-creature—this loss of lack of thought about basic motor functions depressed me. I resolved I would build a boat and float down the lake and when I reached the other side of the lake, I would end myself. For it was clear to me I did not belong in this world.', 'The memories had become a burden I did not want to suffer, for new memories, like thought bubbles, burst inside my head every night and I would dream and nightmare so vivid that I could barely call what I did sleep, in my thrashing and muttering and shaking. So that even though it seemed my skin absorbed some sort of nutrition from the heavy air or the weird sun, still I felt weary forever and horizons became a kind of torture, whether near or far.', 'From these memory bubbles, which were like my forced re-education by some ghost of a school creature living inside me, I came to learn the truth of what had happened immediately after my planting one hundred years before.', '\\xa0', 'I watched my “brother” being born from a patch of weeds beside my body where I slept, my head dissected and held in place by the story-creature. I watched my brother rise and walk back to my neighborhood and into the house I had lived in and make it his own. He drank the milk and the water. He put out the birdseed. He ate the steaks and the fish and the vegetables. He ranted at the television about the news.', 'It was my brother, not me, who put my daughter to bed at night and kissed her on the forehead and read her stories until she slept. It was my brother, not me, who slept with my wife and who laughed at her tales from her work and who took her to the movies and paid the babysitter and, again, drank the milk and drank the water. With my wife. Taking care of my daughter.', 'But I did not remember having a wife or a daughter, and even now saw them at a remove similar to experiencing senses I did not know I had. My gills filled with air. My lungs filled with water. Nothing lived in the right direction; everything died the wrong way up. Memory must be corrupted, gone bad. I made my hands into claws and I ripped at the ground like it was the flesh of the story-creature. How could I have had a family? What did it mean that I saw my brother had a family?', 'I was cut into pieces by the school-creature. I was flailing close with the single-cell. But in the blur and the smudge, with the rot coming to close, creeping up my leg, there by the edge of the lake, it came to me, bathing in the memories, that, yes, I had had a family. Except that the story-creature had taken away those memories from me and given them to my brother. That he might benefit and that I might not suffer. Yet still I suffered with the weight of this—that as I slept for a hundred years, my brother had taken my place in my family and done all of the family things indistinguishable from me. But it was true this made me feel worse, and that if I had woken to knowing I had left a family one hundred years behind me, I might have gone mad or become comatose.', 'Were they buried beneath the dirt floor of the foundation? Had I slept atop them like a faithful dog? I would never know, and nothing in my memories told me. I just knew that I, through the person of my brother, had become a true murderer, for I had helped to end the human species in the form in which we had known it.', 'Every time that my brother visited a neighbor’s house, my brother left a residue that was an anti-story to the one we all knew, and this residue would grow and accumulate in the mind until it was too late to do anything but ', ' and change and change again.', 'Everywhere across my neighborhood, my country, and the world, this residue accumulated, extended silvery filaments across the bottom of people’s shoes, across their palms and foreheads and elbows and the backs of their knees while asleep or awake, and over time everyone must ', ' and in the turning transform in either mind or body or both. For this was the form the change took: a shudder, a turn, a cringe, a shrug. Every time, I saw in memory, my brother took to walking through the streets at dusk so he could peer in windows and see the anti-story take hold as he spread it farther. And with each new filament extended, more people spread the anti-story until eventually it was just ', ' not the anti-story and there had never been an anti-story at all, or any other story to rule the Earth.', 'It did not care about your belief system, your grasp on reality, the excellence of your analysis or your senses, for the anti-story of the story-creature became story by retelling effortlessly what lived at the core of you. So my brother went out walking and thrulled to the thrill of it, made the sounds deep in his throat that sounded like an odd nocturnal bird but were instead the end stages of the anti-story, triumphant.', 'Now when my brother met my neighbors, all knew all and that all was one. My brother’s neighbor was my brother and he was his neighbor. While those they thought might be troublesome head-planted in remote places, as I had, and slept it off—that they might acclimate and hear the song of the one true story in due time. As I was hearing it now, buffeted by it, and yet even though I heard it I was inured to it. But this did not make me hopeful, for it just meant I no longer mattered to the spread of any story or to the plans of the story-creature.', 'I could roam this world as rebel or spy my entire life but the colonization was complete. All I could do is choose when I ended my experience of the world.', '\\xa0', 'I began my journey across the lake, that I might find the end of my story, which was now the anti-story much as I was the anti-brother. I felt like the captain of my own fate, that I might at least control my own body and how long it drew breath—and I wish I could tell you what I discovered I created by my own roving, my own actions, but chance does not reside on the new Earth as it did in the old.', 'This is both a terrible and miraculous thing.', 'I found the dead leathery shell of a creature that might have been like a turtle except a hundred scrawny necks attached to tiny bulbous heads with gaping mouths hung from the inside of the shell, as if these inner heads had eaten the larger creature from the inside out as part of some plan, and I had to cut them all off. They welcomed this art with an eagerness that suggested some maker’s plan remained for the rest of their life-cycle, and indeed I watched those I had severed burrow into the ground with squeals of delight and soon they were gone and I never saw them again and I am glad of that. Then I had to sand down the neck stumps to make the shell float and not be disgusting. Although by then not much was disgusting because the word familiar had changed so much since I had woken.', 'I floated on the black-and-green surface of the lake, with pools of clearest blue embedded in that thickness, and I reflected on my situation. I reflected and refracted my situation, my memories continuing to be absorbed through the epidermis and then into my brain, as if the entire world but me already knew my past. There was nothing else to do, nothing to occupy me, for the lake was slow to travel across, the current glacial.', 'But then the dead shell that was my boat grew a mouth and began to talk to me, for it too still had a role to fulfill in my life in this world.', '\\xa0', 'I was made to understand by the talking dead-shell mouth that whoever should cut the hundred bulbous heads from its undercarriage shall be the feeder that the remaining dead-shell shall converse with, and that by this ritual shall both the feeder and the fed know that learning has taken place. I did not understand the importance of this at first, and considered that it might be a trick by the story-creature, except the story-creature had no part in this.', 'Dead-Shell grew a mouth at the bow, and it was salty and chalky with unshaven teeth that sprouted up crooked, so that the mouth must speak through a thicket of its own slashing surgery. Although it took time, of which we had plenty in that becalmed fish bowl, I came to understand Dead-Shell very well, even if I never discovered if we spoke in Dead-Shell’s language or my own. I suppose after my encounter with the school-creature, I had absorbed a capacity to understand beyond my actual ability to understand.', 'The weather was deep and porous and full of needles and it pressed around us in a way that invigorated even as it pricked, and even if the lake looked like no body of water I had ever seen, I found it melancholy, reassuring, and calm, and thus although Dead-Shell disturbed me, I had been disturbed worse since I had woken.', 'How should a Dead-Shell talk? “Maw maw maw,” it said, and then “Maw maw maw chaw chaw chaw.” And then, “Dam dam dam dam maw maw maw chaw chaw haw.”', 'But this was Dead-Shell throat-clearing and I could feel many eyes upon me from it, except that Dead-Shell’s eyes were not on its dead shell but instead flitting through the underbrush and overbrush on the rotting shores, through thickets of trees roving in their hundreds if not thousands. For Dead-Shell’s evolution made its sight independent of its self, and those eyes too had their own lifecycle, and were so numerous because of the predation upon them. Over Dead-Shell’s span, Dead-Shell would shed upwards of five hundred eyes, and only during the molting could it produce more that would ascend wing-ward to stare down from on-high.', 'Yet still this effect was unsettling to me, and this is why I took so long to adjust to Dead-Shell’s speech. When I turned my gaze to those eyes, I worried for them, for I knew them to be as like to his children, and every hour of every day one or more were eaten, and often I would see this on the far shore to the east or west—I would sense the shriek of the punctured eye from some felon of a predator and you would see the spurt of liquid and Dead-Shell was one eye closer to darkness.', 'All of these punctured and consumed eyes—even when they lay within the belly of the predator—could still see, for Dead-Shell told me that if swallowed whole his eyes would report back to him, from that enemy stronghold, sometimes for months, until expelled, which was usually enough to snuff out the remaining life. Dead-Shell’s brain, not fixed in the meat of him but in his shell, contained such a coiled complexity that I could not quite bring myself to imagine it.', '“Maw maw maw maw maw may may my breather my bruther my brother,” Dead-Shell said, and I knew by this that at least one of his eyes had seen my story and knew of me.', 'This did not matter to me in the least now. It did not matter for Dead-Shell was of the new world not the old and my embarrassment and sorrow and guilt was all of the old world and made no difference in the new world, which had none of the culture I had known. I understood this at least. And so I forgave Dead-Shell not knowing that this opening might hurt me. Even as I sailed down the length of the lake on the inside of his shell and he spoke to me from the bow.', 'The words continued to sound like nonsense to my ears, but to my eyes, my nose, my tongue, my skin, Dead-Shell’s words resonated like the most powerful symphony undercut by the gentlest lullaby.', 'I was being put to sleep and roused to heroic acts, even as all I did was kneel on the dead shell of Dead-Shell. While out of my ears, as if the words must expel matter, poured my understanding, coating the sides of my body and falling away into the water like thick honeycomb in golden multitudes.', '\\xa0', 'Soon I came to realize that Dead-Shell was a sort of scientist-creature on the order of the story-creature and school-creature before him. He communicated to me that the world had been remade against my image and that my form, even much reduced, was the rebellion of the old world against the new, and that this made no sense because the new world embraced the old; that my very presence made the old world manifest, no matter the form, so why was the form important? Why did I hold onto the form?', 'And why did I, holding my form, insist then on negating myself once we had reached the end of the lake? It would serve no purpose and was impossible because I would fail because I could not destroy my constituent molecules; they would still exist, and thus I would exist as well. As still the golden manna sang as it left my ears and streamed down my body, made of my body a clay that must be reformed and redistributed to make sense.', 'A sweet and bitter relief.', 'Better that I succumb to my purpose, Dead-Shell still maw-mawed into me. Better that I become what I must become for a new life and a new journey, for this was the only way to preserve any semblance of the old world…and here Dead-Shell brought to bear all of his thousand eyes all across the land—on the shore, in the trees, in the water, in the belly of myriad beasts and buried, buried deep in the ground, staring up through moss and lichen and rich, thick soil.', 'That I might see through his eyes, might see how underneath the new world lay my old world still. Like the foundation of my house, there it lay, and I saw it all in such a confusion and profusion that I could not hold it in my head and the golden honeycomb that was not honeycomb at all but the movement of my transformation spun out and pushed out from inside of me until there was more of it outside of me than inside of me, and that is how I knew that it had been growing inside of me for much, much longer than Dead-Shell had been talking to me.', 'For Dead-Shell’s words had encased me in honeycomb from the inside out and the fortress of my body lay behind a glistening wall, and that wall was attached forever and always to Dead-Shell, and his task was done, as even the space that had been my brain softened and spread out to coat the inside of that entire space I must call separate from the world.', 'Namely: me.', '\\xa0', 'I toppled into Dead-Shell’s embrace and the dead shell closed around me and bound me, while Dead-Shell’s mouth detached on tiny legs and jumped into the lake. For this was all that was left of Dead-Shell, who must now rejoin his own eyes, or some portion of them and continue on his anointed purpose, his path, which might mean repeating his conversation with yet another person who had slept a century and would reach the lake through the school-creature, but had lagged behind me in his timing.', 'But, meanwhile, Dead-Shell had brought his teachings up and through me and the golden honeycomb that was so much more bound me and I came out from the lake to a river that roared and gushed its way down to the premonition of a vast sea, and along with this roaring and gushing and thrushing came the bobbing and weaving and floating and gliding and all of the other motions of the Dead-Shell eyes, now watching me, turned on me, so that I still saw through them but they ', '. And the weight of that was a powerful thing such as I cannot describe. To be seen in that way.', 'While I could not move for I no longer had what might be called arms and legs but only the motion provided by cilia and by the thick stickiness of the honeycomb, which was both me and not me, was how I could move and how I could stay. Yet my eyes did not partake of the honeycomb. My cluster of half a dozen eyes was too busy transforming into one eye, one giant eye that was also a kind of helmet, as if an eye had been drawn on the glass of an astronaut’s helmet, except that drawn eye could see and the entire globe of glass was the eye. That while I had my hands I put my hands to my face to know that this one eye was enormous, like a world, and that already things swam there like motes but wriggling and alive. I saw so far and I saw so well, and as the many eyes of the Dead-Shell retreated and receded until I saw only through my own face.', 'Beneath, there came an itching and tickling. I had grown fins so I could steer myself fast down the river, now underwater because I had the gills and I had the encasing of golden sap, which I knew was stronger and yet lighter than any substance humankind had ever known, so that I was my own fish but also my own submarine, and I rushed and darted and frolicked through that water in such a sublime way I almost forgot the sense of me, forgot that I had but one eye now. I sought open water. I sought the ocean. And I blessed the thousand eyes of the Dead-Shell, and I blessed Dead-Shell himself for allowing me to be this way, to experience this, to be other than human.', 'I was so fluid in my shell that I could not at times distinguish the water from my self. I could not distinguish a wave from my thoughts. Extinguish me, become me. That is all the river meant to me: a long, thick muscle that would deliver me, and I was that muscle and I wanted the sea. I desired it so badly, more than anything I had ever wanted, and it pushed out all other concerns and I could taste nothing but the sea-to-come and hear nothing and feel nothing but that.', 'And still I was changing, well beyond the changes that had created my brother. Those innocent days, those hours of being planted by a story-creature on a hillside, a sapling springing from my head, were long distant. I could not return to them even if I had wished to.', '\\xa0', 'At the ocean, however, my urgency faded. Having reached that place, I no longer worried about ending my life, for my life had spread and swelled and become something other than it had been. Nor did I worry about much else, and I floated in the glistening green water staring up at the sky, which sagged so close and was not yet full of stars but only the ghosts of stars or a haunting of everything that was not-star, so that by the lack I might think of the word “star.”', 'I received this vision through the taut thickness of the air, which had not yet dulled to dark.', 'Into that calm I was either allowed further knowledge of my wife and my daughter, or these slipped through like silvery minnows of memory darting out of me—still at a remove, but they were true, as if only by turning away so utterly now I could see them, glimpse them back on shore, staring out at me across a century. Who knew where they might be now, if they lived in the world at all?', 'My daughter had liked to stage plays in her room back in the house that was only a dirt foundation now, and she would make us pay to watch them and then she would do what she had planned to do anyway while we sat there with foolish grins, unsure if she was a genius or just sillier than us. My wife made jewelry in the shapes of all the natural things; spoons that were leaves and knives that were stalks of weeds and metal bowls like ponds full of fish. She made me a coiled snake as a band for my wrist, but I wasn’t wearing it when I went to the hillside and though my digging in the foundation may have been to find it, nothing was there. Nothing would ever be there.', 'Fierce as river rush came to me ', ', came to me many trips to the beach with them, and the laughing and the sunburn and the cold drinks and the sand between the toes, and how when that happened time was no longer there, that everything became one moment, the only moment, and it was as if we had not traveled to the beach or would be leaving soon but only that we had ever been there and ever would be there.', 'I had worked as a writer of obituaries; I had not buried the stories of the dead in the backyard. I had worked for a newspaper researching people’s lives. I had a father and a mother who were still alive when I began my long sleep, but they were more distant still, and I could not recapture them, not in any way that had meaning, and with that loss was snapped off the whole branch of relatives and perhaps I had never had close ties to them, but in the succor of the sea, surrounded by such seething life, I felt the lack of those connections and the new connections roared into my head in such a joyous profusion.', 'Touched by the want and need of all of that, I, turning to look back, tried to conquer the new shoreline with the old one. For that would bring more substantial something of old life, old growth. I could almost do it. I could almost revert, for the moment. But not quite.', 'What would this world have been if I had slept and had returned to find it human?', 'Would it have been terrible or beautiful?', 'Would I have recognized it any better, or would humankind have been as banished as if the story-creature had come along after all?', '\\xa0', 'All of this I thought in long and short flashes and daggers and circles as I floated, waiting for the next thing. The sky was the sun and the sea was the sky both and only the thin line between told me of any difference, and the difference meant nothing. I could tell by how the skin of the water lifted below me that the ocean was not the ocean, but instead a great beast, a story-sea that was salt water and not salt water, and that the swells were rising that I might be lifted up into the heavens when finally the sky darkened and the stars came out, and then I might know my destination.', 'I sensed that while I had been shedding my last ancient skin to become pure, there had swum in quiet those who now bobbed and floated around me, others not unlike me—those who had slept on their separate hillsides and then taken a journey to arrive here, and would soon disperse again. All of us with our huge single opaque eye like a helmet and the compact bodies, from which the fins had fallen off, to drift to the bottom and be broken down and become nourishment for the beast that enclosed us in such a wide embrace.', 'There was no music, and yet there was such music as I had never heard before. Distant, so distant, and yet so close. Did we make that music or did the world make that music in celebration of our departure?', 'I did not think I would ever be human again, but I would see things no one of my species had ever seen, and with that thought I began to cry from some excess of emotion that could not go elsewhere.', 'I began to cry as if I meant to swell the sea and drown the earth…and yet even my tears were purposeful, and repurposed by the story-creature. For my tears encapsulated a chronicle of my story, of this story, and every tear that met the ocean’s surface contained all of this tale and every tear shed by every cocooned single-eye to all sides told their tales too, that they might not be forgotten, and might be sheltered and expressed indeed by the sea and the earth itself.', 'Nothing ever could be lost and all would be used, and that was the way of it and part of what Dead-Shell had tried to tell me to comfort me. And so I wept my story into the ocean and the ocean received it and if you know these words you have heard tell of them from the drops of water that fall from the sky and inhabit the lakes and the rivers and all creatures across the face of this world have heard tell of it, including the thousand eyes of Dead-Shell, for they too are self-aware and some of them must have watched us far out at sea, waiting for the next part of the story.', 'The clear substance over my head, the eye of me, had thinned and hardened and taken what it needed from the saltwater, and I was ready. The ocean that was itself a beast began to faster and faster curve upward like the eyes, like the helmets, and in slow-motion began to slingshot us up into the cosmos. But it was not slow motion for long, for the ocean bellowed and sped up and pushed up and its wishes were that we be gone—and at speed.', 'We like children heard and received and as if upon a mighty trampoline were flung up into the stratosphere and then achieved escape velocity in a holy roar and expulsion, through light and dark into dark and weightlessness…until we were all of us tumbling end over end through vacuum, and with each tumble my fellow travelers dispersed farther and farther from me, headed to other worlds than me, to become story-creatures.', 'For we were joyous. We were ecstatic as the stars came at us, no longer veiled, and we saw them in all of the glory that was both ours and theirs.', 'What was breath to us behind our helmets? What was time? What was speed?', 'We could tumble forever and never die, and every sighting of a star filled us like a tiny bliss, a flower opening up and opening up and never fading.', '\\xa0', 'Copyright © 2017 by Jeff VanderMeer', '\\nArt copyright © 2017 by Armando Veve']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['The Ghoul Goes West'], 'Author': ['Dale Bailey'], 'Body': ['A fantasy novelette about two brothers, both obsessed with movies—one a not-very-successful screenwriter, the other an academic. When one dies from a drug overdose, his brother travels to Hollywood to make amends and find out what happened.', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'My brother Denny died when I was twenty-six.', 'I got the call at 1:13 in the afternoon—which made it 10:13 in Los Angeles. I know this so precisely because I’d been at my manuscript all morning, lost in a dream of old Hollywood, and when the phone startled me out of my reverie, I glanced at my watch, as you do when you have been surprised awake. I was in my apartment, at my desk, the merciless August sunlight of east Tennessee molten in my windows. Denny and I had both fled the grim wastes of western Pennsylvania, seeking warmer climes. As soon as he’d collected his high school diploma, Denny had gone west, to California. Two years later, when I collected my own, I’d headed south. I sometimes thought he’d made the better choice, but that morning, when I picked up the phone, I was reminded otherwise.', 'The man on the other end asked if I was Benjamin Clarke.', '“Ben,” I said.', 'The man paused as if the intimacy was unwelcome. When he spoke again—“Mr. Clarke,” he said—I recognized the flat, impersonal sympathy affected by all officialdom, from priests to principals, when bad news was to be delivered. I braced my hand against the desk, and when he started to introduce himself as Officer Something or Other I interrupted him.', '“It’s Dennis, isn’t it?” I said.', 'It was, of course. I’d known it from the minute I’d heard that tone in the officer’s voice. He went on to describe the circumstances, but he needn’t have bothered. Heroin might have been the proximate cause. But it was Hollywood that killed him.', '\\xa0', 'The way Hollywood has of grinding up its postulants was much on my mind at the time. For the better part of a year, I’d been working on my thesis, a study of Ed Wood and his bizarre entourage: Vampira and the Amazing Criswell, Tor Johnson and Bunny Breckinridge, the whole gang of oddballs and misfits, Bela Lugosi among them. In one way or another, Hollywood destroyed them all, but it was Lugosi’s doom that particularly interested me, then and now. It was Lugosi who had drawn me to study film in the first place. It was Lugosi who had drawn Denny to Hollywood.', 'Sometimes I think Lugosi must have dreamed of such a place before he even knew it existed—just as it was itself a dream, roused out of the slumbering dust by men who dared to seize life and pin it still breathing to a screen. It ate its history, and it feasted on hope. In Hollywood, even then, you were only ever as good as your last picture.', 'Lugosi came there in 1928. Already forty-six years old, he’d fled his father’s fists more than two decades before. Fled the cobbled streets of Lugos, where Hungary and Romania kissed. Fled most of all the profession that had been chosen for him. He did not want to be a banker, did not want even to be himself. He wanted to be no one at all. He wanted to be everyone. He wanted to be a star.', 'He’d worked his way to New York in the bowels of a merchant steamer. Broadway brought him fame, but even that fell short of his ambitions. So he took flight yet again, lured on by the glittering promise of the west. He fled until there was nowhere left to flee. He fled to Hollywood, and the sea.', 'Lugosi’s story is unique only in its particulars. In its broad strokes it’s the story of a legion of dreamers just like him: behind them some provincial misery, before them the promise of another self waiting to be born. It’s Denny’s story in a nutshell, and I guess it’s mine as well—but in the winter of 1969, when our version of the universal tragedy really began, Bela Lugosi served as midwife to our aspirations. Denny turned fourteen that year—I was two years behind him—and though Vietnam was in full swing, Nixon had just taken office, and the Steelers were still reeling from a 1-13 season, what mattered most to us that February was a TV personality named Gabriella Ghoul. Pittsburgh’s bodice-bursting answer to Vampira, Gabriella Ghoul had a starring role in both our onanistic fantasies and the local late-night creature-feature showcase.', 'Our mother disapproved of Gabriella and the creature features both, but Denny and I watched them anyway, sitting mesmerized on the threadbare carpet before the old black-and-white Zenith that we’d inherited from my grandparents when they upgraded to color. The movies Gabriella Ghoul introduced varied wildly in quality. If you got ', ' one Saturday, you would get ', ' the next. But Lugosi’s ', '—the only ', ' that really matters—stood apart from both the gold and the dross, sui generis.', 'It is in many ways not a great film. Dwight Frye’s effete, lisping turn as Renfield has not aged well and the visual language of the movie is static and stagy, with little in the way of camera movement. I can still remember our disappointment in the opening scenes that cold February night. We had been snowbound all day and had hoped for something really good—a rerun of ', ' or ', '—to alleviate our boredom. Instead we got this flat, hammy antique.', 'We were on the verge of turning the movie off and going up to bed when Lugosi made his first appearance, creeping down the vast, cobweb-shrouded steps of Castle Dracula, candle in hand. The powerful impression Lugosi made then renews itself every time I watch the film. I am twelve years old again, seeing for the first time his slow, deliberate gestures, listening anew to the broken cadence of his line readings, that inimitable accent, the timbre of his voice. Lugosi’s performance is broad—he never escaped his theatrical training; he was always playing to the back of the house—but his onscreen charisma is undeniable. His presence dominates every frame thereafter, and one leaves the movie thinking it is better than it actually is. Lugosi didn’t just play Dracula; Lugosi ', ' Dracula.', 'I remember tearing myself away from the TV to look over at Denny. He looked gaunt and gray in the flickering blue radiance of the screen, his eyes deeply shadowed. He looked like he was already dead. In some sense, I suppose, he was.', '\\xa0', 'Such were my thoughts as I boarded the plane at McGhee Tyson the following morning. I was routed through Atlanta and I managed to hold thoughts of Denny at bay until the long haul from Hartsfield to LAX. As the plane shuddered and wrenched itself free of the planet, it broke upon me that I was now entirely alone in the world. Our father had died in a mining accident when I was five and our mother had succumbed to cancer almost six years ago, not long after Denny left to chase his screenwriting dreams. I’d been seeing a girl in Knoxville, but both of us were pretty half-hearted about it. I’d left a message on her machine saying that I’d be out of town for a while, I’d give her a call when I got back, though I didn’t expect I’d really do so, and in fact never did.', 'I don’t mean by this to suggest that Denny and I were close. We weren’t. Even before our mother’s death, our dispositions divided us. Denny was reckless and I was not. He had some minor trouble with drugs in high school, and a few brushes with the law, also minor. I was always cleaning up his messes: shoving his laundry into the hamper, dragging him out of parties when he’d had too much to drink, and once, memorably, helping him bundle a half-naked cheerleader out his bedroom window. By the time he graduated high school, movies were the only thing holding us together—and even there our impulses differed. Mine was academic, his creative. I liked to tease scenes apart; he liked to storyboard new ones. When he left for L.A., we were already drifting into separate orbits. Mom’s death finished the job.', 'We talked two or three times a year after that, twenty minutes at most. Denny would share some hair-raising story or other, I would describe my latest academic enthusiasm, and then we’d sign off, fraternal duties fulfilled for another four or five months. We never talked about anything real. I had vague intimations that he’d hit some rough patches in Hollywood, but he never shared the details. He was more forthcoming about his fleeting moment of success, churning out scripts for a sitcom that never found its legs.', '“It’s not a bad show,” he told me a few days after he landed the job. “Have you seen it?”', 'I had not.', '“You should,” he said. “See what your older brother’s up to out here in Tinsel Town.”', 'So I watched a couple of episodes, more out of curiosity than any kind of sibling loyalty. The thing was called ', '. It was about a twelve-year-old girl and a talking dachshund—really an alien in disguise, dispatched from his home planet to study earthlings. The dog was constantly getting into binds because it didn’t understand human customs. Or how to be a dog. People overheard it talking every other episode, initiating all kinds of frantic hugger mugger. The talking was accomplished by bad puppetry. You can imagine.', 'It was beneath my brother’s talents.', '“It’s just a way to make ends meet until something better comes along,” he told me when I pointed this out. “The money’s great. I’m going to be making almost a thousand dollars a week.”', 'In 1980 this was big money indeed. But a TV writer’s job is perilous. When ', ' got its cancellation notice—it would come two years later—Denny would be unemployed again.', '“I hope you’re planning to bank some of it,” I said.', 'Denny just laughed and changed the subject. That was the way it went.', 'The last time we talked, I told him my thesis was on Ed Wood. He was incredulous.', '“Ed Wood?” he said.', 'My thesis director had asked the same question, in the same tone. At the time, ', ' was simply one of the worst films ever made. It had not yet begun to generate the cult of camp affection it enjoys today. My director felt that the project was a waste of my talents, and it was only with great reluctance that she’d signed off on the idea. But I was interested in the tragedy of Lugosi’s final years, and by then his fate had been inextricably bound up with Wood’s.', '“Poor Bela,” Denny said when I explained this. The phrase had been Boris Karloff’s, or so the story went, and over the years it had become a kind of countersign, code for all the things that lay unspoken between us. Poor, poor Bela. Thinking of it now, as I winged my way across the country to untangle the mystery of my brother’s death, I felt something catch in my chest, and for a moment it was hard to breathe.', '“Hey, you okay, buddy?” asked my seatmate, an older guy who’d been drinking gin and hogging the armrest for the last two hours.', '“I’m fine,” I said. I wasn’t, though, and the question didn’t help.', 'It was the same question I’d asked Denny at the end of that final conversation. “Poor Bela,” he’d said, and there was something troubling in his voice. I couldn’t put my finger on it. Sadness maybe, or bitterness, or sorrow.', '“You okay, Denny?” I asked.', '“Fuck you, Ben,” he said. Six months later he was dead.', '\\xa0', 'In his waning years, when he struggled to make ends meet in low-budget farces such as ', ', Lugosi often spoke of suicide. If this talk at first elicited sympathy and concern from Ed Wood and his band of happy misfits, they soon became tiresome exercises in self-pity. You can only cry wolf so many times.', 'This tension came to a head one evening in 1956 when Lugosi found himself in San Francisco, beating the drum for ', ', his first role in a major studio film in eight years. Yet even this modest comeback was a humiliation: once famous for his voice, Lugosi had been reduced to playing the mute valet of Basil Rathbone’s mad scientist. It was this, more than anything else, that led to his suicidal rumblings that night in the fourth-floor hotel room he shared with Tor Johnson, the behemoth former wrestling star who’d once billed himself as the Super Swedish Angel.', 'As the story goes, the Angel, tiring of Lugosi’s musings, knotted one meaty fist in the back of the old man’s Dracula cape. Gripping Lugosi’s belt with the other hand, Johnson thrust him out the open window. I sometimes imagined what the experience must have been like for Lugosi, looking down between his feet at the busy street below. The pedestrians on the sidewalk could not have suspected that only the Angel’s mighty hands, the strained seams of a cheap Dracula costume, and a stifled hiccup kept a drunken Hungarian from crashing down on them.', 'Picture it, if you can: the Angel crying in vexation, “Is this what you want, you damn hunkie?” and Lugosi swallowing, sobered. Inside, he’d pined audibly for an end to his sorrows; his new post outside the window must have imparted an altogether different perspective. The neck of his cape would have felt like a noose; when the Angel gave him a shake, the sidewalk would have wheeled far beneath him.', '“Well?” the Angel is said to have bellowed.', '“I think I vould like to come back in,” Lugosi reportedly said, and so the Angel hauled him back inside to face, once again, his reduced circumstances.', 'What a precipitous decline it had been. There had been a time when Lugosi’s name had been on every lip, when Universal had been inundated with fan mail for their new matinee idol. He’d had money, a sumptuous estate in the Hollywood Hills, a Buick Straight 8 Deluxe. In short, he had been a star. Biographers have sometimes wondered why a man of his stature ever took up with such crackpot scrabblers after Hollywood glory as Ed Wood and Tor Johnson. Most of them have concluded that he was driven by financial exigency. But I wonder if there wasn’t more to it, if Lugosi hadn’t been seduced by the myth of his own stardom, and if they hadn’t fed his need to fulfill that myth. Among Wood and his troupe of lunatic aspirants, Lugosi would have retained the sheen of Hollywood celebrity. If they represented the nadir of Lugosi’s career, he represented the zenith of theirs. The Super Swedish Angel must have admired him. Perhaps he regretted his fit of pique. Perhaps he told Lugosi that he stood at the threshold of a career renascence that would lift them all to the giddy heights of fame.', 'This is all a reconstruction, of course, colored by my own affection for Lugosi. There are multiple versions of the story; only in a few of them does the Angel actually dangle Lugosi out the window. In some, there are others in the room, men who were trying (and no doubt failing) to keep Lugosi sober for his next PR appearance. In one version, Lugosi’s rant occasions a desperate call back to Los Angeles, to Hope Lininger, Lugosi’s fifth wife.', '“He’s threatening to jump,” the caller cried down the line.', '“Then for God’s sake, open the window,” Hope is said to have replied.', '\\xa0', 'I rented a Chevy Cavalier from Avis, threw my bags in the trunk, and caught the 105 east out of LAX. By the time I’d found my way to the 101 and the iconic Hollywood sign hove into view, my muscles were tense from negotiating the heavy Los Angeles traffic. But I still felt a thrill at seeing those nine letters strung across the slope of Mount Lee. Hollywood had always been more idea to me than geographical reality: a liminal threshold between what was and what could be willed into being, where Norma Jeane Mortenson could become Marilyn Monroe, Archibald Leach Cary Grant, and Marion Morrison John Wayne. Hollywood was a place where an impoverished Hungarian immigrant named Béla Blaskó could become Bela Lugosi.', 'In the end, of course, Hollywood had destroyed Monroe and Lugosi both—but it had also granted them a golden moment of stardom. The vast multitude of dreamers who washed up there weren’t even that lucky. They came in search of the selves they might become; they died in obscurity—or worse. In 1932, an aspiring actress named Peg Entwistle hurled herself to her death from the top of the Hollywood sign, a metaphor too obvious even for the silver screen.', 'Movies change lives.', 'That’s the fundamental axiom of my faith.', 'Unfortunately, they don’t always change them for the better.', '\\xa0', 'I found Officer Something or Other—his name turned out to be Grant—at the Hollywood Station of the LAPD, a low brick building on Wilcox. He was gruff and gray, but not unkind. When I asked if I could see Denny’s case file, he sighed. “You don’t want to see that,” he said, and when I averred that I did, he shook his head and set me up in an empty interview room: one-way glass, green and white tile on the floor, an ammoniac smell of Pine-Sol. I sat at the battered table, and looked down at the file, a manila folder labeled with my brother’s name and a case number.', '“Let me fill you in, instead,” Grant said from the door. “Some photos in there, you see them you can’t unsee them, you know what I’m saying. Maybe you don’t want to remember your brother that way.”', '“I think I have to look,” I said.', 'Grant nodded. “If you say so.” He closed the door, and I was alone with the file. I hesitated, tempted suddenly to push it aside, to stand up and let myself out of the room, to catch the next flight back to Knoxville. Denny was dead. What more was there to know or do? I’d spent the first decade and a half of my life cleaning up his messes. Why not let someone else take care of this one?', 'Who knows why we do the things we do?', 'That’s one thing the movies always get wrong: the complexity of human motivations.', 'I opened the folder.', 'The police report was straightforward. A woman had called it in. She refused to give her name, and by the time the police had arrived at Denny’s apartment, she was gone. Denny had been dead for a while. The cause seemed obvious enough. He was on the sofa. The needle was on the floor at his feet. Grant had already told me they were just waiting for the toxicology report to confirm it.', 'I thumbed through the pictures. Maybe they wouldn’t have been so bad if I could have pretended that Denny was asleep. It wasn’t easy to do, though. There was something missing in the set of his face, some vital essence. I couldn’t put my finger on it then, and I can’t now. He was dead, that’s all. You didn’t have to look twice to know it.', 'I tapped the photos into alignment, slid them in behind the thin sheaf of papers and closed the folder. I found Grant in the squad room. He tucked the file away in a drawer. I took the seat beside his desk.', '“You okay?” he asked.', 'That question again. I laughed without humor. “Sure. I guess so.”', 'Grant studied me in silence. A buzz of activity filled the room, low and electric: men talking quietly into phones, the hum of a photocopier, laughter from a counter by the coffee urn.', 'Grant had tracked my gaze. “Can I get you a cup?”', '“No.”', '“Good. Stuff tastes like battery acid,” he said. “Is there anything else I can do for you, Mr. Clarke?”', '“Did he suffer?”', '“Just went to sleep, that’s all.”', 'I thought about that for a while. There was suffering and there was suffering. I figured you didn’t stick a needle in your arm unless things were pretty bad.', '“I’d like to see his apartment,” I said at last. “Am I allowed to do that?”', '“Have to ask the property manager. We’re done there. I can call ahead, if you want.”', 'I said that I’d like that. Thanked him. Stood.', '“Mr. Clarke.”', 'I turned to face him.', '“How long has it been since you’ve seen your brother?”', '“Two years.”', '“You were close?”', '“No.”', 'He nodded. “No use chasing ghosts,” he said.', 'But I didn’t have any other choice, did I? How else could I lay them down to rest?', '\\xa0', 'By the time I wheeled the rental into the lot of Denny’s apartment complex, the buttery California light was melting into the arms of an enveloping blue dark. The shadows softened the utilitarian lines of the building, a repurposed motel, run-down and graffiti scrawled, the windows barred. An overflowing dumpster leavened the cool air with its reek. According to the sign out front, this was the Paradise Arms—the master stroke, perhaps, of an accomplished ironist.', 'I caught the manager as she was closing up for the day. She was weary and heavy-set, sixtysomething, kind. “I’m sorry for your loss,” she said as she led me to Denny’s apartment. “It’s an awful tragedy.”', 'She unlocked the door and turned on the light.', 'The place was a not unpleasant contrast to the squalor outside. The kitchenette, behind a waist-high dividing wall, was spotless, the living space clean and spare, without luxury aside from the TV—a 32-inch Panasonic with a matching VCR. The other furnishings had seen better days. A card table piled with books looked like it might collapse at any moment. The chairs were mismatched. The sofa sagged. A half-dozen video tapes in clear rental boxes stood atop a coffee table that could have been fished out of the dumpster outside. From the far wall, where Denny had taped up a poster of ', ', Lugosi leveled his menacing gaze. Bela had brought Denny to Hollywood. It was fitting, I suppose, that when he died there, Denny had died under the failed Hungarian’s watchful eye.', '“You’ll want to go through his things,” the manager said. Then, apologetically: “Sooner is better, of course.”', '“Yes.”', '“You could start in the morning—”', '“Why not tonight?”', 'She glanced at her watch. “It’s nearly six. You’ll want to get to your hotel.”', '“Perhaps I could stay here.”', 'I could see her thinking it through.', '“Is the rent paid?” I asked.', 'The manager hesitated. “Through the end of the month,” she said. In divulging this, of course, she had already conceded. Five minutes later she pressed the key into my hand, and a moment after that I was alone in the apartment where my brother had died.', '\\xa0', 'But it was Lugosi, as much as Denny, that I found myself thinking about that night as I sat sleepless in his living room, wired with jet lag. Denny had lost his battle with drugs; Lugosi had won his. In 1955, shortly before the debut of ', ', his second feature with Ed Wood, Lugosi checked himself into Metropolitan State Hospital for morphine addiction. He was by then poverty stricken, emaciated by alcohol and drug abuse, despairing. Wood had pledged the premiere’s proceeds to defraying Lugosi’s medical expenses, but the opening-night profits, if any, must have been negligible—certainly inadequate to cover even a fraction of Lugosi’s costs. Despite Wood’s ambitions as an auteur, he had no talent or even competence as a filmmaker, and his posthumous fame as a camp icon was then inconceivable. It is one of the tragedies of Lugosi’s career that critics routinely rank his films with Wood among the worst movies ever made.', 'Nevertheless, Wood was a good friend to the former star, paying him regular visits at the hospital long after Hollywood had written him off, and promising him the lead in his next opus when there were no other parts to be had. Perhaps the scripts Wood showered him with provided Lugosi some comfort during the harrowing three months that followed. He later described his withdrawal from morphine as a nightmare of painful extremes: scalding fever one moment, glacial cold the next. At times, he could not bring himself to move. At other times, his limbs spasmed violently. He gnawed his blankets to fight the pain. He shat himself, a hot, reeking gruel down the back of his thighs, and he wept in shame as the nurses cleaned him up. Afterward, he struggled to the chair, humiliated, and watched them change his sheets with businesslike efficiency. “I want to die,” he moaned, and it was true: in that moment, he longed for nothing more than annihilation.', 'Yet he recovered, and when he left the hospital, he exited with one of Ed Wood’s screenplays in hand. “I’m looking forward to work again,” he told a reporter on the steps of the sanitarium. “I have an assignment playing the star part in Eddie Wood’s ', '.”', 'But Wood could not get the financing to shoot the picture. Lugosi had played his final starring role. A little more than a year later, he died of cardiac arrest while taking an afternoon nap. Hope Lininger found him clutching a copy of Ed Wood’s unproduced screenplay. Hollywood had killed him a decade before. The heart attack merely made it official.', 'Poor Bela, Denny would have said. Poor, poor Bela.', 'But Denny, too, had died in thrall to the bitch goddess of the screen. He’d sacrificed everything to her: his ambition, his family, and finally his life. When Mom fell ill, I took a sabbatical from school and returned to Pennsylvania to take care of her. I hadn’t been home a week before the doctor told us she had six months if she was lucky. I called Denny with the news. “Come home,” I said.', '“I will,” he promised, but the sitcom deal was just coming together, and he kept putting it off—one week and then two. The weeks piled up and turned into a month.', '“You need to come, Denny,” I said. “She’s dying.”', '“One more week,” he said, but there were no more weeks to be had. She died three days later.', 'Denny didn’t come home for the funeral, either. He’d been in the writers’ room of ', ' for less than a week and didn’t want to risk making a bad impression. Mom would have understood, he told me, and maybe she would have. But I spent the rest of the fall at home alone, seeing the will through probate, getting the house ready to put on the market, attending to the life insurance and a thousand other details. When all was said and done, the estate came to just over $80,000. I mailed Denny a cashier’s check for his half, and included Mom’s engagement ring as a keepsake—something to remember her by, since he seemed to have forgotten.', 'I talked with Susan Mazur, Denny’s agent, the next afternoon. She had an immaculate second-floor office in an old building, two blocks off Wilshire. I’d expected something altogether different: a high-powered Hollywood super-lawyer in a glass box downtown. William Morris maybe, or CAA. But of course Denny didn’t move in those circles. It had been three years since ', ', and as I’ve said, that had been a middling success at best, commensurate neither with his ambitions nor his ability, which had apparently been considerable. He was good—“really good,” according to Mazur. “Hell, that was part of his problem,” she told me. “He thought he was ', ' good for this town.”', '“What do you mean?”', '“I mean that show, the dog from space thing. I worked hard to get him in that room, and he blew it.”', '“How?”', '“The kid was a wreck. All he could talk about was you and your mother. It was a tough thing for him, losing your mom. After he quit—”', 'I sat back. “I thought the show was cancelled.”', '“That was later. He lasted a couple months at most.” She gave me an appraising look. “He didn’t tell you?”', '“No, I—He never mentioned it.” I’d always assumed that he’d lasted for the entire run. “What happened?”', '“He decided talking dogs were beneath him. He should have stuck it out, saved the money against a dry spell, but—” She shrugged, sighed. “It’s hard to take in, isn’t it? What a terrible goddamn waste.”', '“When did you see him last?”', '“A month ago, maybe? Not long. He had this script he wanted me to look at,” she said. “Some kind of crazy biopic about Bela Lugosi. Not a commercial project. I have it around here somewhere.”', '“Can I see it?”', '“Why not,” she said. “Let me see if I can dig it up.”', 'She showed me to the door ten minutes later, still shaking her head in disbelief. And then I was outside, Denny’s screenplay in hand. I tossed it on the passenger seat of the Cavalier. I couldn’t bring myself to look at it. What kept coming back to me was how furious I had been when Mom had died and he’d decided to stay in California. What kept coming back to me was the conversation where I’d told him that talking dogs were beneath him. Now, I wondered why I’d found it necessary to share that insight. He surely didn’t need me to point out that he’d fallen short of everything he’d hoped to be.', '\\xa0', 'In the months after my mother died, when the house seemed to echo around me, I probably saw two or three movies a week—virtually every film that showed up in the small town where Denny and I grew up. I felt something unclench inside me the minute I walked into the theater lobby. The ushers and projectionists soon knew me by name; the staff at the concession stand had my order waiting by the time I stepped up to the counter. But the really comforting moment came when the lights went down and I fell away from myself, lost in whatever dream flickered to life on screen. I watched without discrimination. I might see ', ' one night and ', ' the next, and both were fine by me. It didn’t matter what world the movie carried me off to, as long as it carried me away from that pinched and narrow Pennsylvania town—from the stark fact of my mother’s death, and my resentment of Denny for leaving me to tie off the loose ends of her life alone.', 'And even when I wasn’t at the movies, I was tuning in to them at home. There were still lots of films on network TV in those days: Johnny Weissmuller on Saturday afternoons and Shirley Temple on Sundays, and all sorts of made-for-TV movies, from ', ' to ', '. And though Gabriella Ghoul was long gone, you could always count on catching a Hammer horror film after the late local news on Saturday night.', 'Movies, then. Movies to the last.', 'And it was a movie I needed when I returned to Denny’s apartment that night. I sat at the card table, eating takeout Thai and studying the books piled up around me. Most of them looked like research for the Lugosi screenplay: the standard biographies (Lennig, Bojarski, Cremer), plus a study of the classic Universal monster movies, two or three histories of Hollywood’s Golden Age, and a coffee table book featuring photos of Los Angeles in the thirties. But just then I didn’t want to read about movies. I wanted to lose myself in one. So after I put my leftovers in the fridge, I sat down to look at the videos on the coffee table.', 'I was halfway through the stack when I realized that the movie I was holding didn’t exist.', 'None of them did.', '\\xa0', 'As far as I’ve been able to determine, Lugosi never met Gene Autry, the famed Singing Cowboy of the ’30s and ’40s. But during the last year of his life he was scheduled to star opposite Autry in ', ', the Ed Wood film he’d mentioned on the steps of the sanitarium. This is not as implausible as it seems. Wood’s former roommate, Alex Gordon, who’d grown close to Autry, could well have brokered an introduction. And Autry might have welcomed the opportunity to work again. By 1956, his career was on a downward trajectory. He hadn’t appeared on screen in three years. He’d gained weight. He was drinking heavily. Hollywood had been extraordinarily good to him—he’d made ninety-three films between 1934 and 1953—but in the end she withdrew her favors. The proposed film never came about. Wood couldn’t get the financing. Autry backed out. Lugosi died, leaving Wood with a handful of test footage he recycled into ', ', the camp classic that would cement his reputation as the worst filmmaker ever to square up a shot.', 'The entire episode earns only a single dismissive sentence in Lennig’s otherwise comprehensive Lugosi biography. It doesn’t even merit that in Autry’s 1978 memoir.', 'Yet the film I was holding—a commercially produced VHS tape—was clearly labeled ', '. And it was not alone. A second glance through the stack confirmed that the other films were similarly impossible. They shouldn’t exist. They ', ' exist. They had never been shot. They’d been abandoned. But here they were. Here was the Orson Welles adaptation of ', '. Here was ', ', Marilyn Monroe’s final film, left unfinished at her death. Here were Hitchcock’s ', ', Clouzot’s ', ', von Sternberg’s ', '. A prank, surely. Someone had pasted fake labels onto the tapes—but why? To what purpose?', 'Retrieving ', ', I glanced at the sticker on the case: Dimension Video. Then I turned on the television and slotted the tape into the VCR. The film opened with a black-and-white shot of the Amazing Criswell seated behind a desk, delivering a bizarre monologue about “the mysteries of the past which even today grip the throat of the present to throttle it.” The speech was portentous and theatrical, overcooked, the framing static. Then the image faded, to be replaced by a flat desert landscape with a saguaro cactus, obviously fake, on the right side of the frame. The credits came up on the left, each new name preceded by the sound of a pistol shot. Autry had first billing, Lugosi second, both of them above the title. The rest of the cast followed, among them Vampira and Paul Marco and Tor Johnson, Wood’s usual suspects. My only thought as the attribution credit came up—', 'Written \\x9f Directed \\x9f Produced', 'by', 'Edward D. Wood, Jr.', '—was that I was looking at some kind of bizarre forgery. Then Lugosi, in full Dracula garb, appeared on screen, rising from a casket in a dim crypt that looked like a suburban garage. It was unmistakably him. By that point in my thesis research, I’d seen virtually every movie Lugosi had made three or four times. I knew the shape of his face almost as well as I knew my own. I recognized the trademark gesture as he turned to face the camera and swept his cape around to cover his mouth. A stroke of lightning split the screen. It illuminated a gothic castle set implausibly atop a desert butte—clearly a painted flat, executed with about as much expertise as you’d expect in a third grader’s school play. Another cut, and here was a posse of cowboys gathered around a campfire. In the shot that followed, Gene Autry showed up, stout and out of shape, possibly drunk. He was strumming a guitar and belting out “Back in the Saddle Again”—or trying to belt it out; his once-pleasant tenor was shot, and he was slurring his words.', 'I won’t try to describe the film that followed. It involved Lugosi, his vampire wife (Vampira, of course), and his mutant servant (Tor Johnson) menacing some rancher’s daughter, whom they wanted to impregnate (!) with their atomic ray (!). Autry and company rode to the rescue. It didn’t make much sense. But it wasn’t a forgery. Lugosi was undeniably Lugosi, Autry was unquestionably Autry. And the production was signature Ed Wood. The writing was incoherent, possibly the product of insanity. The production values were appalling.', 'Mesmerized, I watched the film straight through to the end, rewound it, and watched it again. The whole enterprise saddened me. This was Hollywood. Its most fervent acolytes were mired in delusion. Its fading stars clung to their former celebrity. If passion alone had been enough, Ed Wood would have been an auteur on the order of Orson Welles (though Hollywood destroyed Welles, too); if hunger were sufficient, Lugosi and Autry would have held the spotlight until they died.', 'After that I watched the other films. By the time I finished the last one, ', ', it was nearly four. I rewound the tape, ejected it, and put it away, examining the plastic box for the second or third time. It was identical to the rental cases you saw everywhere in those days. Beyond the name of the store, there was no information to be had—no address, no phone number, nothing. The videos might have come from anywhere. They might have come from nowhere at all.', '\\xa0', 'Denny’s alarm roused me, grainy eyed and exhausted, just past nine. I had one of those moments of psychic dislocation that you sometimes experience when you wake up unrested in a strange bed. For a breath, I wasn’t sure where I was or how I’d ended up there or why, and when it all came flooding back—Denny’s death and the long cross-country trek and the stack of movies that did not, that ', ' not, exist—the whole series of events felt like some unfathomable dream. I sat on the edge of the bed for a long time. When I finally pulled things together enough to stand, I had to nerve myself up to face the movies in the next room. I was afraid they’d be there. I was afraid they’d be gone.', 'They were there.', 'I resisted the impulse to sit down and watch them through again immediately. Instead, I breakfasted standing in front of the open refrigerator, eating drunken noodles straight out of the box. After a shower, I felt almost human again. Human enough anyway to sit through the first fifteen minutes of ', ', to see if I could pick up anything I’d missed the first two times around. This was futile. There aren’t many nuances in an Ed Wood film. What you see is what you get. So I rewound the tape, ejected it, loaded it back into its box—and then, seized by some access of anxiety or paranoia, hid it away behind an old blanket on the upper shelf in Denny’s closet. Grabbing the video of ', ', I went looking for the manager in the old motel office.', 'She stood behind the counter when she saw me come in. She wanted to know how I was doing, if I was making any progress on Denny’s apartment. I lied on both counts, held up the video, said, “Do you have any idea where Dimension Video is?”', 'She pondered that, said the word Dimension aloud, as if that would help her remember. At last, uncertainly, she said, “I don’t know about Dimension. There’s a Video Hut a block over, by the laundromat.”', 'A Video Hut was useless to me, of course. I asked to see her phone book. Sitting on a hard plastic chair in the lobby, I checked it and checked it again, white pages and yellow pages, under both movie rental and video rental. Nothing, nothing, and nothing. If Dimension Video existed, it wasn’t trying very hard to get the word out. I sighed and handed the book back across the counter.', '“You find what you’re looking for?”', 'The answer was no, in senses both literal and existential. I took a chance on the Video Hut. Maybe they’d bought the stock of a defunct store.', '“I don’t think so,” the ponytailed kid behind the counter said. He squinted at the label on the box, then handed it back to me. “Sorry I can’t help. Maybe you should talk to the lady owns the place. Lou. I could take a message.”', '“I’ll check back another time.”', '“Your call,” he said. “Have a good day.”', 'I promised that I would try.', 'It was a fruitless endeavor, though. I dropped the video off at the apartment, climbed into the Cavalier, and spent the rest of the day touring L.A. I visited Lugosi’s star on Hollywood Boulevard. Had he lived to see it, Lugosi would have been thrilled at this affirmation of his achievements. But Hollywood took him to its bosom too late. He died mostly forgotten in a small apartment on Harold Way—the last stop on my swing through the city. I stood outside in the cool California evening, gazing at that apartment for a long time. I’d already tracked down Lugosi’s other homes, following the ascension of his star from the Ambassador Hotel to his mansion on Outpost Drive, where he lived at the apex of his fame in the mid-30s, and through its long decline in a variety of ever smaller accommodations during the ’40s and ’50s. But the Harold Way location struck me most powerfully. How could a man who had once commanded the adoration of millions wind up in such straitened circumstances, I wondered, and as I stood there in the blue twilight, watching the streetlights come on one by one to shed their soft refulgence, it seemed to me that the air filled with the inconsolable longing and desire of a city full of disappointed dreamers.', '\\xa0', 'Denny’s screenplay was no biopic, because the Bela Lugosi it depicted never existed.', 'Bela Lugosi died in August 1956.', 'He did not shoot a film called ', 'in the spring of 1957.', 'He died clean. Despite all his faults, despite a failed career, despite his manifest deficits as a father and a husband, despite his despair, he never relapsed, and part of me despised Denny for depriving Lugosi of the one battle he had in reality won. Perhaps the first star to submit himself—publicly—to drug treatment, Lugosi left the hospital a changed man.', 'The Lugosi in Denny’s screenplay did not die in ’56. The Lugosi in Denny’s screenplay relapsed when Hope Lininger finally reached the limit of her endurance and abandoned him—which also never happened. In Denny’s screenplay, Lugosi, desperate for a fix and no longer able to find a doctor who would cooperate, turned to Tor Johnson. The Super Swedish Angel, who suffered from bad knees after his years in the ring, had no trouble getting a prescription. But he was a tormented man. Out of dog-like devotion, he procured Lugosi’s drugs; out of love, he begged Lugosi not to use them. Lugosi did, of course, and by the time ', ' went before the cameras, he was dosing himself regularly, sneaking away during breaks on the set to shoot up in the run-down studio’s lavatory—a filthy closet with a hollow-core door and a broken privacy lock.', 'It was in that lavatory that one of the key turning points in the screenplay occurred—a brief scene, but an important one: Lugosi is fumbling with a syringe when Gene Autry knocks at the door, saying, “Hey, is anyone in here?” Bela, startled, drops the loaded needle. It fetches up under the sink.', '“If it will please you,” Bela says, “I will be just one min—”', 'But the Singing Cowboy has already barged into the bathroom, cradling a pint of bourbon. He’s pressing a drink on Lugosi—“Breakfast of champions,” he says—when he notices the syringe. He retrieves it, holds it up to the fly-specked light. “Hell, Bela,” he says, “I thought they got you off this stuff.”', '“Yes,” Lugosi says, helping himself to a slug of the breakfast of champions. “So did I.”', 'Sitting there at the card table in Denny’s apartment, I sipped at a beer and turned the pages of the screenplay. The scenes sprang to life before me—Gene Autry’s discovery that his director is a transvestite (“Hell, son,” he says, “is that a skirt?”) and Lugosi’s developing conflict with his co-star. Bela, despite the morphine, is always the consummate professional. Autry, on the other hand, is a sloppy drunk. He forgets his lines; he misses his marks. Matters come to a head when they’re shooting the campfire scene that will introduce Autry’s character.', '“Eddie,” Lugosi says to Wood, “horror picture is perhaps no place for singing ‘Back in the Saddle Again.’”', '“But he’s the Singing Cowboy,” Wood protests.', 'Lugosi, too focused to notice that Autry has walked up behind him, says, “His voice, Eddie, it is not so good anymore.”', 'Eddie’s eyes widen. “Bela—” he says.', 'Too late.', 'Autry’s hand closes over Lugosi’s shoulder. When he turns, Autry’s face looms into his field of vision like a small moon, blotchy and cratered with pores.', '“Why you son of a bitch,” he says. “You junkie, you ghoul.”', 'And then he punches Lugosi in the face.', '\\xa0', 'Gene Autry’s Cowboy Code, a set of ten rules by which the Singing Cowboy’s young fans were to live their lives, expressly forbade socking seventy-four-year-old men in the jaw. “The cowboy must be gentle with children, the elderly, and animals,” Rule Number 4 read. I know this because Denny inserted the entire code as a title card into his screenplay. In the scene immediately following, he imagined a reconciliation between the two men. The slug line placed the action in the Cameo Club, the bar Lugosi—the real Lugosi—frequented in the final year or two of his life. To my knowledge no pictures of the place survive, but I have always imagined it much as Denny described it: dim and cool, with scuffed barstools and booths of buttoned red leather: an old man’s bar, quiet, little frequented, Lugosi nursing his bruised jaw with a cheap scotch when Autry sits down beside him.', '“Have you come to punch me again?” Lugosi inquires.', '“No.” Autry sighs. “Eddie said I might find you here.”', '“I do not wish to be found.” Lugosi stands, dropping a handful of bills on the bar. “Good evening, Mr. Autry.”', '“Stay a while, why don’t you?” Autry says, touching Lugosi’s elbow. “I’ll buy you a drink. Hell, I’ll buy you a dozen, if you like.”', '“Please not to touch me,” Lugosi says, but he slides back onto the stool.', 'Drinks are ordered: bourbon, a top-shelf scotch.', 'Autry sighs, lifts his glass in toast. “It’s a slippery goddamn slope, isn’t it, Bela? One day you take a drink, the next you take two, and suddenly you can’t get through the day without the stuff.” He snorts. “You know what I mean?”', 'A bit of stage business follows. Lugosi takes out a lighter and lights one of his reeking cigars. He takes his time getting it going, turning the cigar in the flame until he has it burning evenly. He puts the lighter on the bar. “Bourbon, morphine,” he says. “It is the same. Sometimes, I think it would be better if I—” He shakes his head, draws on the cigar, expels a stream of noxious smoke.', '“Sometimes what?”', '“It does not matter. I am too much a coward.” Lugosi meets Autry’s gaze. “And you, Mr. Autry. What is it that you fear?”', 'Autry looks down. He turns his glass on the bar. “You know, Bela, I went to serve my country in the war. Flew C-109s over the Hump, and I was never afraid. But when I came back, Roy Rogers had taken over as the number one singing cowboy in America.” He shakes his head. “Irrelevance. I guess that’s what I fear the most.”', '“You are a young man yet.”', '“I’m forty-nine years old.”', '“I was forty-nine when I played Dracula,” Lugosi says. “You have many lives yet. Me, I am an old man. Finished, as you Americans say.”', 'Autry laughs. “You Americans, huh? How long have you been in America, Bela?”', '“A long time,” Bela says, and though Denny’s screenplay makes no such note—one of the limitations of cinema is that it has no access to its characters’ inner lives—I imagine Bela suddenly stricken with nostalgia for his native land. He had forever been a stranger to his adopted one. “Listen to my voice,” he says. “I am neither American nor Hungarian. I am always in between, a failure, a nothing.”', 'When Autry protests—“Now, Bela,” he begins—Lugosi waves him off. “You are a cowboy,” he says. “You are more than American, Mr. Autry. You ', ' America. Me,” he says, “I am hunkie. I am failure. I am, as you say, a ghoul.”', '\\xa0', 'I didn’t finish Denny’s screenplay—not then. I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Instead, I snagged another beer from the refrigerator, retrieved ', ' from its hiding place in Denny’s closet, and plugged the tape into the VCR. I couldn’t really concentrate, though. My mind kept drifting back to Denny. I wondered where he’d found the thing. I wondered what he’d thought of it.', 'I think that’s what I missed most after Denny disappeared into Hollywood: just chewing over old movies with him, finding out what he thought about them. He was the only person I’d ever known who could talk about the films I wanted to talk about. Don’t misunderstand me. My classmates in the master’s program were cinema geeks, too. But they wanted to discuss Buñuel and Visconti. Denny and I were more interested in O’Brien and Harryhausen. They read ', '. We subscribed to ', '.', 'The last movie we saw together was Henry Hathaway’s 1947 film noir, ', '. Mom had been gone two years by then. I had just finished college with a more-or-less useless degree in English and had taken the year off to contemplate pursuing a still more useless degree in Film Studies. In the meantime, I was working in a video store and conducting a scattershot survey of film history, skipping around in the store’s collection at whim. I was in my blaxploitation phase when Denny called to say he was coming to visit.', '“Why?” I remember asking.', '“Just thought I’d catch up with my baby brother,” he told me. “That okay with you, Ben?”', '“Sure,” I said. “Why not?”', 'Which is how he ended up in Knoxville a month later, crowding into my run-down apartment in Fort Sanders. In the week that followed, he slept late while I put in my hours at the store. After I clocked out, we ate delivery pizza, drank beer, and watched whatever we’d selected from the shelves for the evening. And talked movies, of course—what we’d seen, what we wanted to see, what we should see. Directors and leading men. Starlets and scream queens. The night before he left we wandered up and down the aisles, looking for something to watch. I pushed for ', '. Denny made a case for ', '. We compromised on ', ', though we’d both seen it before. It had Victor Mature in one of his best roles, and we both loved Richard Widmark’s star-making turn as an unhinged, giggling psychopath named Tommy Udo. And of course it also had perennial heavy Brian Donlevy, cast against type as an assistant district attorney.', 'Donlevy had his own connection to Lugosi.', 'In 1952, after Lugosi fell on hard times, his then-wife, Lillian Arch, went to work as an assistant on Donlevy’s TV program ', '. Donlevy and Lillian soon became close. At one point Lugosi, drunk and stricken with jealousy, called the ', ' production office, and demanded to speak with Donlevy. “That man is destroying my marriage,” he raved. Sober, he regretted his loss of composure, the latest in a series of self-inflicted humiliations, both personal and professional. The final blow came when Lillian left him less than a year later. Donlevy must have played a role in her decision—she would marry him in 1966, ten years after Lugosi’s death—but I think she loved Lugosi all the same. She’d stayed with him through two difficult decades, watching helplessly as he spiraled into morphine addiction, alcoholism, and poverty. Though he couldn’t see it, Bela was the one destroying the marriage, not Donlevy. He’d just worn Lillian out.', 'Denny disagreed. “It wasn’t Bela’s fault, not the way you mean. Those were symptoms, not the problem. If he’d made different decisions—”', '“Like accepting the Karloff role in ', ', I guess.” This line of reasoning was nothing new. Lugosi had famously declined the role. He didn’t want to endure hours in make-up every day. He didn’t want a part without lines. He didn’t want to be typecast as America’s bogeyman—though of course it was already too late for that. He was too old to be the leading man he’d hoped to become. His accent was too thick, the impression he’d made as Dracula too indelible.', 'Karloff, on the other hand, had accepted the role—had embraced it, and turned in a performance still stunning in its pathos. ', ' elevated him to stardom, and he made all the right choices thereafter. He embraced his role as the bogeyman, held out for good parts, and went on to enduring success.', 'Lugosi became Karloff’s shadow other self, Karloff what Lugosi might have been.', 'But Denny had another perspective. Turning down the role had been a life-changing mistake, sure—assuming he could have turned in a performance of Karloff’s caliber. But Bela had even then had it within his power to save himself.', '“How?”', 'Stardom is a tricky thing, Denny told me. An illusion. Gossamer and moonlight. “You have to act the part,” he said. “No matter how dire the circumstances, you hang on to the fancy cars, you make yourself seen at the best restaurants, you date the most beautiful women. You project the illusion long enough, you become it.”', '“The man was bankrupt in 1932,” I objected.', '“The man was too proud to call in his markers.”', '“What markers?”', '“Bela was huge in 1932. He should have traded on that celebrity. All he needed to do was hang on for the right part. Instead, he sold himself short for the first thing that came along. He looked desperate. And desperation is fatal.”', '“Whatever you say, Denny,” I said. “Come on—early day tomorrow.”', 'It was, too. We were up before dawn, off to the airport. It was raining lightly, and as the oncoming cars hissed by, shadows streamed across Denny’s face. He was quiet, pensive.', '“What’s on your mind?” I asked.', 'Denny studied the strip malls as they slipped past. “I haven’t been entirely honest with you.”', '“Okay.”', '“I need money, Ben.”', '“Money? Jesus, Denny, Mom left you forty thousand dollars.”', '“You don’t under—”', '“What about your talking dog? You made plenty of cash then, didn’t you?”', 'He sighed.', '“Didn’t you?”', '“Ben—”', '“Answer me.”', '“It’s gone,” he said. Then, gazing out at the line of mountains in the distance, dark against the brightening sky, he said, “It’s all gone.”', '“What happened to it?”', '“It’s like I said last night,” he replied. “You have to look the part, okay? You have to be the thing you want to become. After a while, I just couldn’t maintain the lifestyle. I kept waiting for the next break.” He laughed. “You saying you don’t have the money, Ben?”', '“I work in a video store.”', '“That’s not what I asked.”', '“Yeah, I have it.” I hit the ramp for the airport exit too fast, and braked hard, the car leaning into the curve. “I need the money, Denny. I’m going back to school.”', '“Right. Okay, then.”', 'A jet roared in overhead. I pulled to the curb at Departures. Traffic was just beginning to heat up. Taxis and shuttle buses, people smoking on the sidewalks. I got out and walked around the car and heaved Denny’s bag out of the trunk.', '“You should come with me,” he said.', '“You know that wouldn’t work.” I held out my hand. “Take care of yourself, okay?”', 'Denny ignored my hand. He pulled me into a hug. “You, too, Ben,” he said. And then, reaching for his bag: “But I guess I don’t have to worry about that, do I?”', 'He nodded and started off down the sidewalk. I watched him all the way through the sliding doors. He didn’t look back.', 'I never saw him alive again.', '\\xa0', 'I kept knocking back beers until everything grew fuzzy and my vision narrowed to a dim tunnel. At some point I stumbled off to bed. I woke up after noon, hungover, my memory of the night before an oily void shot through with stark eidetic flashes—rewinding ', ' for yet another viewing, trying to concentrate on Lugosi’s performance, though my focus slipped for seconds, minutes, half an hour at a time; sitting at the card table, staring blindly at Denny’s screenplay, as if the title page alone could reveal some truth or explanation that I hadn’t noticed before. But if any truth was there, I could not in the light of morning recall it.', 'I got up, scrubbed the moss off my teeth, and washed down a couple of Tylenol from the medicine cabinet. In the living room, I ejected ', ' and returned it to its case. I swept a dozen beer cans off the kitchen counter. When I carried the garbage bag out to the dumpster, I saw that I’d parked the Cavalier halfway up on the sidewalk. I had a vague memory of going out for more beer. I was lucky I hadn’t killed someone.', 'I stashed ', ' in its hiding place in Denny’s closet, and headed back out to the car. I spent the next couple of hours at a nearby mortuary, chosen for its proximity to the apartment as much as anything else. The undertaker was professionally solicitous. He expressed his condolences, asked about a burial plot, tried to sell me a casket and set up a service. I nixed the service and opted for cremation instead. I was out of there in less than two hours, but the experience brought Denny’s death home to me with a raw finality that transcended even that of the photos in the case file. I kept thinking about the way we’d been when we were kids, before we drifted apart—before Lugosi and the doom he’d brought down upon us.', 'I passed a park, and pulled over. The air was warm, but not oppressive, as it would have been in Knoxville. The foliage was in riotous bloom. I found a bench and turned my face to the sun, letting the warmth burn away the hangover. Denny’s words came back to me, paradoxical: to become the self you aspire to be, you must inhabit that self from the moment you imagine it into being. Maybe that had been the difference between us. I’d always been more or less content being me. Denny, for whatever reason, had longed to be someone else, had sacrificed everything on the altar of that dream. I wondered if he might have achieved it if I had given him the money he’d asked for. I’d been frugal with my half of Mom’s inheritance. It was true that I had planned to go back to school—had indeed done so—but it was also true that I could have spared at least enough to keep him going for a while. What might have happened then? What might he have become? And underneath these questions, others, troubling in different ways. How had he acquired the movies? And having come into possession of them myself, what was I to do with them?', 'Where was Dimension Video?', 'I had a small epiphany then: I’d never intended to return the movies, not really. How could I relinquish them? But I was desperate to see the rest of the store’s collection. Denny would have felt the same way, of course. For him, the desire might have been more pressing still. After a decade in Hollywood, he’d never seen a single word he’d written appear onscreen. But what if in some other time or place—some place where Ed Wood had gotten the financing to shoot ', ' and Marilyn Monroe had survived long enough to finish ', '—Denny too had found success? What if his own movies, the movies he’d only dreamed of, were waiting on the shelves of Dimension Video?', 'The question was absurd. Impossible. But, then, the whole thing was impossible.', 'I tried to puzzle out some sense or logic in it, some explanation for the entire episode, but by the time I returned to my car—hours later—no answers had presented themselves. I stopped for a sandwich on the way back to Denny’s apartment. Afterward—by impulse—I swung the car into the lot of the Video Hut. Maybe the owner was in.', 'She was.', 'The guy behind the counter directed me to an office at the back of the store. She stood when I introduced myself: a tall, angular woman in her thirties with a cap of close-shorn blond hair, not pretty exactly, but you wouldn’t soon forget her. Her name was Louise Roth—“but everyone calls me Lou,” she said, settling me in the molded plastic chair opposite her desk. She listened attentively as I explained my dilemma: my brother had left some rental tapes I’d like to return, but the rental boxes had no address or phone number—just a name, Dimension Video.', '“Dimension Video, huh?”', '“That’s right.”', '“I’d let it go,” she said. “No one’s going to come looking for them. Lost tapes are the price of doing business. I’m sure you have bigger fish to fry with your brother’s death. What was his name? Danny?”', '“Denny.”', '“Right. Tall guy, dark hair, lived down at the Paradise Arms, is that right?”', '“You knew him.”', '“Not really. I remember him, though. He used to come in and pick up a movie once in a while. He had good taste.”', '“What do you mean?”', '“Most people, they want the new releases or the adult films. Your brother went a little deeper—he was always hunting up some obscure movie or other. Mostly we didn’t have what he was looking for. But he stuck around to talk once in a while. We both had a fondness for old horror movies. Not a lot of people want to talk about ', ', you know what I’m saying?”', 'I laughed. “That was Denny, all right.”', '“Funny thing is,” she said, “he came in not too long ago asking about Dimension Video himself.”', '“Well, he seems to have found it.”', '“Finding it wasn’t the problem,” she said. “Finding it again was another thing. He was looking to return the videos he’d rented there, and the place had just evaporated. So he said, anyway.”', '“That doesn’t make sense. If he’d rented the movies there in the first place—”', '“Exactly.” She leaned back in her chair, steepled her hands under her chin. “He said it specialized in hard to find stuff. Really hard to find. That true of the movies he left behind?”', '“You could say that.”', '“Care to tell me what you have?”', 'I hesitated. “You ever hear of an old Marilyn Monroe flick, ', '?”', '“Doesn’t exist. Not the whole film, anyway. She died and they never finished it.”', '“I know,” I said, and after that neither of us said anything at all.', 'Finally, I stood. I thanked her for her time.', 'She accompanied me out through the store. The evening rush was just beginning, the aisles filling up with nine-to-fivers looking for something light to kill the evening. I wondered what they’d think if they knew that somewhere out there a store called Dimension Video was renting out movies that didn’t exist. I suspected they wouldn’t much care. Lou, on the other hand—Lou walked me all the way out to the Cavalier.', '“I’m sorry about your brother,” she said as I slid behind the wheel. “I don’t know what he was into—or what he’s gotten you into—but if that movie did exist . . .” She shook her head. “Well, I would give a lot to see it.”', '“Thanks again,” I said. “Really.”', 'She stepped back. I closed the door, started the car, and pulled away. I glanced in the rearview mirror when I got to the light at the end of the block. She was still there, watching me.', '\\xa0', 'There was a girl in Denny’s apartment.', 'I heard her when I swung open the door: a rustle in the gloom, a silence that felt like waiting. I switched on the light. Everything was as it had been: the books and the mismatched chairs, the TV, the video tapes stacked on the table. Imagination, nothing more, I thought, but I checked the bedroom all the same.', 'She was cowering on the other side of the bed—a slender blonde. I put her in her mid twenties. In that light it was hard to be sure.', '“Don’t hurt me,” she said.', 'She said, “You look like Denny.”', 'She said, “I miss him.”', '“I miss him, too,” I said, and the statement struck me with the force of revelation: I’d been missing Denny for years. I hadn’t even known it.', '\\xa0', 'We ate at a diner down the street—Luke’s, a place that didn’t look much more promising than the Paradise Arms. Booths of torn green vinyl. Chipped plates and peeling laminate on the tables, a dead fly on the window seal. Fluorescent tubes buzzed overhead. In the flickering yellow glare, she looked weary and brittle, older than I’d thought she was, haunted by the ghost of her own beauty, which was utterly conventional. At home in Wisconsin, she’d have been a stunner. In Hollywood, she was just another pretty girl—and that was before time and care had begun to take their toll. Her blue eyes were dull, bracketed by fine lines, her lips pale, compressed by weariness. She was too thin in a town where it was impossible to be too thin.', 'Her name was Julie and she’d come to L.A. to be a star. She’d become a hostess at a steak house instead, making the round of open-call auditions for more than five years, in which time she had scored only one part—if you could call a single line (“Is that a dachshund?”) on ', ' a part. The only positive in the whole experience, she told me, had been meeting Denny, and even that was debatable. “He quit the show two weeks later,” she told me. “He said writing lines for a talking dog was beneath him.”', 'So there went that chance—for both of them.', 'She kept up with the auditions. He kept tinkering with screenplays. Eventually, they moved in together. I never knew anything about it, of course. So much of Denny’s life had been hidden from me. Another secret didn’t seem to matter.', '“Was he using drugs?” I asked.', 'She shrugged. The shrug was eloquent. This was Hollywood. Weed, coke, pills, you name it: one thing led to another. Nancy Reagan could have predicted it. It hadn’t happened overnight, but when the money began to run out, they’d broken up. She wasn’t cut out for the Paradise Arms. She didn’t like heroin. She moved in with a girlfriend from the restaurant. She didn’t see Denny much after that. But she missed him constantly. She worried. She checked in two or three times a week.', '“You were the one that found him, weren’t you?” I said. “You called it in.”', 'She sighed. “Don’t tell, okay,” she said. “Please. I don’t need the trouble.”', '“How’d you happen to be there?”', '“He called me. Said he wanted to say good-bye. I asked him want he meant, but he didn’t say. He just told me he loved me.

There was another Ed Wood—a ghostly doppelgänger who’d directed a ghost of a film starring the ghost of a man who’d died of a heart attack a year before ', ' ever went into production. I couldn’t sort out who was real and who wasn’t. All I know is that I camped out in Denny’s apartment so long that I ended up taking over the lease. A month passed, and then another. I ate takeout pizza. I ate Chinese. I ate at Luke’s. I drank too much beer. I drank until I was sick of myself, and then I woke up hungover one day and poured all the booze in the apartment down the sink. I showered, ate a slice of cold pizza, and walked to the Video Hut. Lou was in her office.', '“I have some movies I think you ought to see,” I told her.', 'We watched them that night on the sofa where my brother died. She gazed at the flickering images in rapt silence. “Where did these come from?” she asked at one point, never taking her eyes from the screen. “I don’t know,” I said. After that, Lou and I took up the search for Dimension Video together. Somewhere along the way we started seeing each other. I suppose it was only a matter of time. We have a lot in common—almost as much as Denny and I did.', 'Which brings me back to Denny. Denny and Lugosi.', 'In the final scenes of Denny’s screenplay, Ed Wood wraps ', ' and the cast retires to the Cameo Club to celebrate. Autry buys rounds for everyone—“I have plenty of money, anyway,” he tells Lugosi—but is otherwise morose. Bela shares his dolor. “I have not even that solace,” he says, and though the screenplay doesn’t describe his thoughts, one can easily imagine him ruminating about the cramped apartment on Harold Way. Awash in morphine and Autry’s top-shelf scotch, he might have drifted for a time, lost between Hungary and Hollywood, the career he’d had and the career he could have had, scraps of old dialogue straying through his mind: ', ' and ', ' and, most of all, ', ', the phrase that had made him a star. Perhaps he would have recalled a fragment of his monologue from ', ', the previous picture he’d made with Eddie Wood. ', ' he might have said. ', 'Except he couldn’t, of course. The world mastered him. Denny’s screenplay ends with Lugosi’s death—not from the heart attack that killed him in reality, but from a deliberate morphine overdose. He’d found fame as Dracula, but his success never reached the height of his ambition and he spent the rest of his life watching it slip away.', 'Denny wasn’t even that lucky. He squandered his moment. He would write no talking dogs. Hollywood killed him as surely as it had killed Lugosi before him.', 'And me?', 'Ten years further on, and I’m still here. I work behind the counter at the Video Hut these days. Lou and I do what we can to steer our clientele to the films that matter most to us, but it’s the new releases and the adult videos that keep the lights on.', 'And I guess that’s the end—except for the matter of Denny’s ashes. They came back to me in a cardboard box the size of a shoebox. I opened it up one time, expecting, I suppose, a fine gray powder. It was coarse and granular instead, with whitish-gray fragments that could only be bone. They would have made a fine prop for a Bela Lugosi movie. Irony: it’s good for the blood, Gabriella Ghoul would have said. And with that I closed up the box again. It sat on the chest in Denny’s bedroom for several months before I drove it down to Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, where Lugosi is buried in the Dracula cape he could never seem to shrug off in life. I scattered a handful of ashes there. The rest I scattered at the base of the Hollywood sign during a midnight expedition up Mount Lee. The sign isn’t as impressive as you think it will be when you see it close up—but nothing ever is, is it?', 'When I was done, I thought about Peg Entwistle and I thought about Lugosi and I thought about the movies that couldn’t possibly exist back home in my apartment. But they ', ' exist. Somewhere, in some other place than this, those movies were made. Somehow they wound up in Denny’s possession, and that’s enough to give me hope. I like to imagine that there’s a place where Peg Entwistle became a star, where Bela Lugosi became the leading man he’d aspired to become, and where my brother Denny still survives, living up to the measure of his dreams.', 'Copyright © 2018 by Dale Bailey', '\\nArt copyright © 2018 by Dadu Shin']}\n"

When a dead body comes through her portal at a time of growing rebellion, Xin is drawn deep into a station-wide conspiracy along with Ouyang Suqing, one of the station’s mysterious, high-ranking starmages', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', 'The body arrives during the second refrain. It slaps on the receiving dial with the wet sound of rendered flesh, and the processing officer, a young woman fresh from the originworld, screams.', 'It’s the scream that alerts you. You didn’t see the body come in, didn’t witness its ungainly, sprawling materialisation through the white of the portal. When you lift your voice in concert with your song-sister on the originworld, the act consumes you. 怒发冲冠、凭栏处。You are in rapture. You see nothing and hear nothing but the music your twinned voices produce. 抬望眼、仰天长啸、壮怀激烈。Your existence dissolves from the throat outwards while you deform the shape of the universe: 三十功名尘与土、八千里路云和月。You are no longer a person, but ansible, transmitting matter and energy across light-years through your song.', 'Like a clawed hand, the woman’s scream shreds into this ecstasy. It tears you out of verse and chorus. You look, and there lies the thing on the dais: naked, skin flayed, flesh laid open in petals. It came through the portal you and your song-sister created across the yawning gaps of space. A man, eyes open and filmy. There’s no blood.', 'You scream. That too is a kind of song, of fear expressed in unorchestrated keys.', 'The fear brings feet running through the door. First in are two rank-and-file in security red, gun muzzles up. Their faces go tight when they see the body.', 'Then comes a buzz like a tide, low and inexorable. The processing officer goes stiff beside you. Everyone on the colony knows that sound.', 'The starmage arrives ready for a fight, her suit lit up and crackling, the shapes of dragons swarming over its surface. Your heart stalls when you see her face. Officer Ouyang Suqing carries herself with laser intensity, focused and terrible. She throws a barrier around the body, a translucent shape of magebright, glass-thin and fire-white. Without a word she goes to one knee, her back to you, studying the mutilated corpse. You watch her raise her arm and pass it over the top of the barrier. Suit pieces flutter and reassemble over the elegant lines of her wrist, capturing the skew of the viscera below. Silence reigns but for the hum of the suit, cycling in concert to the starmage’s pulse.', 'The security officers keep their guns alert and fixed on you. You understand their fear and suspicion: after all, the Imperial Executioner arrives on the colony this week to mete out his punishment to rebellious elements. He comes to end the life of one Traitor, but who knows how many heads will roll before he leaves? Any lapse in the accepted order could prove fatal. Better you than them that gets the blame, right? You are merely ansible, a replaceable unit.', 'Officer Ouyang rises to her feet. Standing, the starmage considers the body for agonising moments more. Your heartbeat stutters like a frightened child. She turns to you, her eyes dark and wide in her duty mask. “Are you alright?”', 'The mask distorts her voice and it comes out sawbuzz, rounded vowels turned to square waves. You had expected interrogation, and your mouth had been ready to offer fact and statement, situation and report. It opens and closes rhythmically, like ventricular flaps.', 'The starmage frowns and retracts the mask, exposing the sculpted bones of her cheeks. “Ansible Xin. Are you alright?”', 'Dumbly you nod, a lie.', 'She takes your left hand in her suited ones and applies pressure. Her gift flares and pushes a wave of calm through you, warmth spreading from your wrist towards the heart. Everything grows heavy. Your breathing slows and the world thickens to honey. Her suit-buzz settles deep and languid in your chest.', '“You should rest,” Officer Ouyang says. “This must be upsetting for you.”', 'She turns to the security officers. “At ease. There is no danger here.”', 'The security officers hesitate, but only for a moment. A starmage’s word is law, and this one carries the name of Ouyang. They understand who her father is, and by extension, who her father’s mother is. Their guns, holstered, return to neutrality. Their expressions do not. The man on the left asks: “Will we open a murder investigation, then?”', 'Officer Ouyang frowns. “There will be an investigation, but no murder has been committed here.” She points to the magebright-encased corpse. “This man was killed long before he arrived here. Other jurisdictions will become involved.”', 'She looks back at you, and the processing officer. “Which jurisdiction are you connected with?”', 'Your tongue is too sleepy to reply, so the processing officer does: “Great one, we connect with the originworld on fifth-days. Everyone knows that.”', '“Of course.” The starmage looks away. Her face registers coldness, or maybe offense.', 'The processing officer swallows. “Great one, I apologise. I did not mean—”', '“At ease,” the starmage says. Her face is so carefully controlled as to be unreadable. She turns to you. “Ansible, are you able to speak?”', 'You fight the blanket of slowness she has thrown over you, and nod. “This humble one can.”', '“That’s good,” she says. She does not ask you to speak again. Instead she says: “You will be taken off duty so you can recover.”', 'Your wrist still tingles from the starmage’s touch, nerves carrying an afterimage of her fingers. You wonder what is happening on the other side of the broken connection. How did the body get here? Your song-sister Ren on the originworld, how does she fare?', 'The two rank-and-file are still nervous, still exchanging glances. “Great one,” the one on the left says, “will this affect the execution?”', 'Officer Ouyang casts her glance over the contained corpse. “It will not. I will speak with the Starmage General and he will decide the best course of action.” She frowns. “But mind you don’t spread word of this to others. The hearts of the people are unsettled enough.” Starmage’s word is law. The two officers bow their heads.', '\\xa0', '满江红, the river bleeds red as the moon-tides: This is the twinning song your cluster learns in the temple. The eight of you—Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin—sit in an octagon around Ren while you practice, the sun warm in the room, the sky a circle of blue through the acrylic window.', '怒发冲冠、凭栏处、潇潇雨歇', '抬望眼、仰天长啸、壮怀激烈', '三十功名尘与土、八千里路云和月', '莫等闲白了少年头、空悲切', 'Ren is your center, the spoke through which the rest of you are threaded, the one who must stay on the originworld and sing to the Eight Colonies. You keep your eyes open while you sing, so you can watch Ren’s lips, painted red, shaping the sounds of the first words: nu, ah, ong, an. Over the months the shape of those lips have grown in appeal. The shape of her eyes, the shape of her bosom. The soft oval of her face. You sing eight hours a day, taking breaks to drink and eat and wash and please one another. At night the cluster sleeps in the same bed, skin against skin against skin against skin. Murmuring the song, murmuring sentiments of rage and patriotism.', 'This is what it is, to be ansible. To be the same in song and in sex and in sisterhood. When you walk across the temple grounds as a cluster—no ansible walks alone, for there is no such thing as an ansible alone—the starmages stare at you. Whether in curiosity or in pity, you do not know.', '\\xa0', 'When the starmage visits, unsuited and unannounced, she brings with her a basket of tropical stonefruit, plump and ripened: Smooth-peeling lychee, blood-red rambutan, dusky-skinned dragoneye with flesh that breaks between the teeth. The crate came in with the originworld shipment two days ago, passed through before the corpse’s interruption. An officer’s perquisite.', '“I wanted to make sure you were alright,” she says.', 'You sit on the single stool by your table, your knees pressed together like a pilgrim’s palms, gaze fixed on her splendid silhouette, bright against the unfinished metal walls of your room. Penned in your quarters, she is close enough that you can see, in exquisite detail, the interfacing implants lining the length of her neck. A queue of coin-sized circles breath soft and green, vanishing under the curve of her shirt collar. Outside of the mage suit she looks oddly tangible.', '“This humble one is alright,” you lie. The corpse visits your dreams at night, its filmy eyes blank and unreadable. Sometimes it sits up from the dais, innards spilling like cutlery, and it tells you secrets with its grey tooth-filled mouth. That knowledge abandons you when you wake.', '“The investigation has ended,” the starmage says. “This was a triad affair. Nothing to do with us. The victim ran up insurmountable gambling debts on the originworld.”', '“Then it won’t affect the execution?”', '“Let us hope not.” She looks uneasy. The prospect of the Imperial Executioner’s arrival frightens even someone like her.', '“Why did they send it here?” You shouldn’t be asking questions of a starmage and an officer, and yet you are.', '“As a warning. They have a relative on the colony. Do you know Quartermaster Lu?”', 'You twitch your shoulders. You know the name, possibly the face, but not the person.', '“This was his cousin.”', '“It is a great pity.”', 'The starmage cracks a rambutan in her mouth. Its soft thick hairs curl around her lips as she sucks in the collected juices. “I’ve put you on three weeks’ leave,” she says.', 'You are halfway through a lychee, its slippery flavour delicate on your tongue, wetness running over your knuckles and down to your elbow in a thin line. You swallow. “Why three weeks?”', '“You must have time to rest,” she says. “The colony can cope without the outside world for a short period of time.”', 'You bow your head. “This humble one is most grateful.”', '“You need not be so formal with me,” she says.', 'You study her face, noting how sharp and bright it is. She is as young as you are, perhaps younger. A terrible burden to carry, the title of starmage. You wonder if she ever tires of it.', '“Thank you again for the fruit,” you say. “I appreciate it.”', 'She smiles and the expression triggers a memory of another face, a broad rectangle, dappled in the sunlight.', 'As she leaves she hesitates at the door. Half a moment passes with her back to you. Then she turns, “May I visit you again?”', 'Like a festival drum your heartbeat quickens. “My quarters are too small. They are not a suitable place for visitation.”', '“Then you must come to mine. I would like to ask you over for dinner. Seventh-day evening. Will you come?”', 'Starmage’s word is law, but the confidence that comes imposed on her manner is missing. You wet your lips with a tongue still slick with lychee juice. “I will.”', '\\xa0', 'Your separation from Ren is inevitable, yet it is no easier to bear when it comes. The night before you leave for Eighth Colony you cling to her damp skin, trying to breathe in as much of her as possible, terrified of losing the piquancy of her scent to the wash of time. She kisses your jaw and neck and lips with the fierceness of one who does not know when they will eat again. You are the last of the cluster to be assigned a position; the bed yawns with the blankness of missing bodies.', '“We have our song still,” she says, but you both know it is not the same, it is not sufficient, it will forever be insufficient. You spend the weeks in the lightspeed cocoon feeling empty, bereft, bereaved, halved.', 'Eighth Colony greets you with huge metal struts and too much air, cold and recycled, the sounds of swarming multitudes carried upon it. You spill from the belly of the cocoon into lifelike chaos. The mage-crafted glass floor of the arrival dock hangs over a marketplace, and beneath your feet shouting, haggling bodies weave between the bright lights, citizens and officers and grey-clad auxiliaries. Their faces are hidden from you; all you see are impenetrable black dots.', 'And then you raise your unhappy eyes from the ground and your heart trips over itself. The old ansible has come to greet you, to introduce you to the life you are meant to take over. Beside her grey-clad self stands a starmage, dragons alive on her suit. Her hair is short, her eyes deep-set, and her jawbone could shatter iron. When you look at her all you see is someone else, laughing in leaf-filtered sun, glowing in blue-tinted moonlight.', '“Ansible Xin,” she says. “I am Officer Ouyang Suqing. Welcome to Eighth Colony.”', '\\xa0', 'The Imperial Executioner’s ship arrives on sixth-day. Its shape eclipses the stars, an arrowhead of pitch blotted above the glass domes of Eighth Colony. The sounds of life go quiet in its shadow.', 'In the main atrium, couples stroll between drooping fringes of vegetation, framed by starscape and warmed by lantern balls suspended in the air. You enjoy spending your off hours as a spectator to this thoroughfare of romance, collecting impressions of smiles and shy glances as if for a vault.', 'Then the Imperial Executioner appears on the walkway circumnavigating the upper dome, robed in red and gold and black, and masked. White bisects crimson across its furious features. The citizenry freezes. Trailing in the Executioner’s wake are two starmages, Officers Ouyang and Wu. Tigers prowl the latter’s suit.', 'Faces in the atrium turn white with terror, sharp with anxiety: A tableaux of miseries drawn up by the Imperial Executioner’s pull. A burning spreads in your belly, too.', 'The three of them pass through the upper deck of the atrium in a wreath of silence. When the last glimpse of brocaded robe vanishes through the doorway, the whispers boil to the surface. Brows furrow, tongues curl desperately around fears of saying the wrong thing. Rebellion burns throughout the breadth of empire, and the Imperial Authority is less than pleased with Eighth Colony’s involvement in it. Their bliss shattered, the couples dotting the atrium retreat into the shadows.', 'You imagine that, in her passage, Officer Ouyang turned her head to look at you for the briefest moment. A comforting thought. A terrifying thought.', '\\xa0', 'Your first lover is a girl named Mingyue. Her face is broad and rectangular and her laugh fills the atria of your heart. You met on the grassy courtyard of the temple, two young mages beginning their journeys towards greatness, away from their hometowns for the first time. The days lengthen into weeks spent enraptured, intoxicated. Lying in the sun under the nesting swallows she reaches for your hand, and you pull it away. Later that day, in the evening, she says: “We can meet where no one will see us. No one will know.”', 'And you are young, and you have the gift, and the world is wide, so it’s easy to believe those words. Her flesh dances tart, sweet, bitter, and hot against your tongue.', 'But of course, you are found out. They come for you in the moonlight when your unclothed limbs are entwined like vines, so it is impossible to deny what has happened. Like a startled rabbit you try to run, but Mingyue freezes, and you cannot abandon her. So they take you, too. Where would you run to, anyway? They know who you are.', 'They separate the two of you in ansible training; you never see Mingyue again. On the second day, when your crying has stopped, they bring you to meet Ren and the rest of the cluster. Your name becomes Xin, the last to join them.', 'You hate Ren. You hate her soft round face, you hate her meekness, you hate her sweetness toward you. The twinning song feels rancid on your tongue, cuts like grit in your ears. You sing it tonelessly and improperly and the portals won’t form within the cluster. If the other ansible girls resent you, you don’t care. When Ren tries to take your hand to pull you aside you hiss at her. You sleep alone, even if it means curling on the cold floor with your back to the cluster.', 'Ren never gives up. She keeps reaching for you, keeps talking to you, keeps coaxing your voice into the harmony. She joins you on the floor at night, wrapping thin arms around your rigid shoulders. Placing kisses on the line of your bones. You watch her grow pale and tired and wish she would just leave you be.', 'Hatred turns to pity turns to exhaustion. No one has the energy to fight forever.', 'One day Ren sits by you during the afternoon meal, her leg pressed flush against yours. “I too had a name before this,” she says. “My father named me Wang-sun. I am the third of three girls.”', 'Wang-sun, a wish for a son. The sentiment her family wanted her to carry for the ages. You ask: “Do your sisters have the gift also?”', '“No. I am the first. They thought there was to be a starmage in the family.”', 'But instead she became ansible, just like you.', 'You study the shape of her face, which has become familiar to you over the weeks, if not quite cherished. You realise you can choose to be happy, and accept the love you have been given, or you can remain in despair forever.', 'You take her hand. “My name was Tian,” you tell her. An empty field, a paddy waiting to be filled. The relief that envelops Ren’s face provokes deep shame and guilt.', 'But the rest of the cluster accepts your induction without comment, and you come to realise that perhaps each of them entered ansiblehood much the same way. A shared grief, a common wound. Being ripped apart so that there’s something to put back together. Your hurt made you all the more dear to them.', 'Sometimes you wonder if Mingyue was a trap, deliberately set, sieving each batch of new mages to find more recruits for the ansible program. But dwelling on the idea will only bring you ruin. You love Ren. You love her as much as you possibly can.', '\\xa0', 'The starmage has made steamed dumplings and other small eats. Curved glass sprawls along one wall of her quarters, exposing starfield marred by the shape of the Imperial Executioner’s ship. Her red dress clings to her, embroidered brocade interspersed with windows of translucent silk. Sequins glitter in the low yellow light. In comparison you are clad in the shapeless grey that is the only thing populating your wardrobe.', 'You bite into soft dumpling flesh and the hollows under your tongue fill with fragrant soup. The flavour is so rich a shiver passes through you. “How is it?” Officer Ouyang asks.', '“Incredible.”', 'You almost didn’t come. Twice you walked in sight of her door and both times you turned back. On the third jaunt, you decide there’s nothing for her to trap you in: You are innocent of involvement in the murder, and your worst secret has already been revealed. So you go in.', '“Can men be ansibles?” she asks you.', '“Of course. Anyone with the gift can. It just takes practice.” You toy with a piece of chicken while you study the small shifts in her face.', '“They used to say only women of a certain closeness could do it. That was how they explained it.”', '“That’s not true. There’s nothing special learning it. They just don’t want to teach anyone else.” You add, deliberately, “', ' could do it with a man if you wanted.”', 'She ducks her head. “I wouldn’t.” A blush creeps across her cheeks. “I could not be that close with a man.”', 'You had suspected this, and you wonder why she’s telling you this now, at this fraught juncture, when you have been on this station for years.', '“I used to watch the ansible clusters in the temple,” she says very carefully. “I envied you, you know.”', '“Envied us?” Your chopsticks hit the table with a clink. You gesture at her massive quarters and the finery that she wears, the entitlement that was ripped from you when they caught you with your hand between Mingyue’s legs. “What is there to envy?”', 'Her teeth tear at her bottom lip. “I only meant the way you could walk around so easily holding hands, touching each other.” She looks down at her own hands and says slowly, “I wanted something like that too.”', 'You know exactly what she means. You refuse to show her sympathy. “So why didn’t you? It’s easy to be recruited. You know how.”', 'She lowers her head still further. “I couldn’t. I would bring eternal shame to my family. It’s different for me.”', '“Unlike me, who was a farmer’s daughter?”', '“That’s not what I meant. I did not know of your background.”', 'You push your chair back. “Ansible Xin,” she says, as you stand. “I apologise. I did not mean to offend.”', 'A starmage should not be apologising to an ansible, it upsets the order of the world. “There’s nothing to envy about our lives,” you say. “If only you knew what we have endured. What we must continue to endure.”', '“I apologise.”', 'There’s a note of misery to Officer Ouyang’s face that pulls at you. You sit back down: It would be rude to leave with so much food still unfinished. But you stay silent as you eat, and she follows suit.', 'She only breaks the silence when you are preparing to leave. The words come out papery, fragile as mist: “Ansible Xin, I have behaved abominably today. But I wish to try again. Will you come tomorrow evening? I’ll prepare something for you.”', '“Tomorrow? Is that not the day of the execution?”', '“It is.” Mention of the execution sinks like black tar in the atmosphere between the two of you; the starmage fidgets, her brows knitting together in a difficult line. “Have you witnessed an execution before?”', '“I have not.”', '“I see.”', 'The silence traps you like honey, heavy and cloying, and you are so tired of fighting it. You could drain it all away by grabbing her, kissing her on the lips, showing her what she has been missing in her lonely, hidden life. You could.', '“Will you come?” she asks again.', '“I will consider it,” you say.', '\\xa0', 'The execution is broadcast on screens throughout not just Eighth Colony, but the length and breadth of the empire. Slaughter a chicken to warn the monkeys. You wait among the mass of Authority officers and auxiliaries packing Eighth Colony’s largest theater, which today will be a theater of death.', 'On the stage the colony’s four starmages stand arrayed in a rectangle: Tiger, phoenix, dragon, horse. Each of them clutches in both hands a long metal rod, painted the red of justice. They drown out the thousand murmuring voices by pounding the rods onto the stage floor in an accelerating crescendo. Echoes drill into skulls. The house lights dim; the show is about to begin.', 'Two masked figures haul a third onto the center of the stage. Traitor is naked except for the ropes that bind her hands in front of her. Once she had a name, but now and forever she will only be known as Traitor. Nine iterations of her family will be thus disgraced, their names wiped from the register and those two characters written in their place. Her skin is blanched funerary white but her face is swollen with the red of beaten flesh. They force her to her knees. The sound of bone against wood lingers.', 'You look at her face. Its shape is young, its features arranged in despair. This girl could be Officer Ouyang. This girl could be you.', 'The Imperial Executioner’s entrance is heavy: Heavy footsteps, heavy silence, heavy gasps from Traitor as fear floods her chest and lungs. She shakes as the Executioner stands behind her.', 'The Starmage General comes to the stage carrying the imperial scroll: A small man made towering by his massive suit, nasal voice amplified to operatic volumes. He pulls the scroll open and proclaims:', 'The Executioner’s hands loom over Traitor’s head. A cocoon of magebright envelops them and springs around Traitor’s kneeling body, fine enough that you can see her through it.', 'The magebright hums.', 'Razorwire lines run from one side of the cocoon to the other. They descend. Where they meet skin they start to slice. Traitor shrieks, a high thin animal sound. Every muscle in her body strains, but there is nowhere to escape. Her hands are claws, her neck corded with veins and tendons as her screaming tears through it.', 'The razorwire continues to strip her away, layer by layer, cell by cell. Blood springs from her in a fine mist as the cuts start stripping the flesh under the skin. Muscle peels from the face trapped in a rictus of agony.', 'You can’t watch. You have to watch.', 'The wires gouge deeper and deeper. Her face and eyes are almost gone now. Traitor still screams through her lipless mouth. Beside you one of the auxiliaries starts sobbing. A guard in executioner’s black comes and pulls him out of the line. He makes one sound, like a stricken rabbit; you dare not turn your head to see where they take him.', 'The screaming comes to a choking halt as the flesh of her throat flays off. You wonder how long she remains alive after that. The heart is buried under layers of viscera, and the quivering brain is still shielded by bone. The pulp of Traitor’s body accrues in the shape of an arrow and turns black and hard, like metal. The Executioner is turning her ground meat into sculpture, a lesson that will sit in the atrium for all to learn.', 'The flesh of your own body rebels and your throat fills with heavy sourness. You pinch your lips together and stare at the mask that obscures Officer Ouyang’s face until waves of dizziness envelop you. Is she watching? What is she thinking? How could she just stand there?', 'But then, are you not also sitting where you are, and watching?', '\\xa0', 'When you go to keep your evening appointment you find Officer Ouyang’s door barred in your face. A mage-locked door may stop others, but she forgets what you are. She forgets that you too have the gift.', 'Your entrance startles her. She stumbles to her feet, face red and crumpled, voice cracked: “Why are you here?” She hasn’t dressed properly and hair sticks from her scalp.', '“You invited me.”', 'Her surprise collapses into despair: She has forgotten. She turns away, her back forming an uneven, sloping wall. “Please leave. I cannot, I do not—”', 'Your room is small, and cold, and you fear the things you might see when you close your eyes tonight. “Have you never witnessed an execution before?” you ask. You simply assumed that she had.', 'The starmage shakes her head. Her knees find the floor for support as she folds over herself. You place your hands on her back, and a shiver passes through her body. But it is not just mourning that grips her. She presses her fists into the ground, the knuckles white through reddened skin.', '“Were you close with Traitor?” you ask.', '“Her name,” she hisses, “was Siyun.”', 'Siyun, a gentle cloud. “So you were indeed close,” you say.', '“No.” She sits up and you detach from her, putting a small space between the two of you. She still won’t look at you. “Siyun and I were—we were only briefly acquainted. Perhaps if she had been receptive to my friendship, or to something more, we could have been.” Her voice goes low with rage. “She did not deserve this. She was barely involved in rebellious activities. She was unlucky, they caught her! And decided she would be a scapegoat. This is injustice.”', '“You could have stopped the execution. You were right next to her on the stage.”', 'Now she turns to you, fury sharpening her features. “And to what end? Do you think I could have saved her, when the throne wanted her blood? Eighth Colony’s situation is precarious enough. Do you know what price open rebellion will demand?”', '“So we let them slaughter us like animals? Worse than animals. No butcher would be this cruel.”', 'Officer Ouyang sets her shoulders. “There is a time and place for everything.”', 'She is revealing things to you that she shouldn’t, not if she wants to keep herself safe. Her trust in you is dizzying. “And are there others you know who take part in these rebellious activities?”', 'Ouyang Suqing looks away. Her silence is your answer.', 'You reach for her hands and she lets you take them. You tell her that your room is cold, too cold, and has too much empty space in the dark. Space where ghosts can hide, and find you with their bloody fingers in the night. She simply nods. Here, the two of you can keep each other warm. Safe from ghosts.', '\\xa0', 'In the course of the nights that come you dissolve into each other’s arms over and over again. You show her all the things that she has been denied and all the things that she has been denying herself.', 'You tell her your name is Tian.', '“Can you teach me the song?” she asks, curled with her head against your shoulder.', '“No,” you say, and the hurt shows on her face, but 满江红 is your song, yours and Ren’s. It is not to be shared. “Pick another. Pick one I might know.”', 'Suqing looks at the stars arrayed outside her window. Now that the Imperial Executioner’s ship is gone the view is clear. She breathes softly on your skin while she thinks. Songs nestle in her mouth in soft hums as she tries them out. Something seems to catch her fancy:', '「明月几时有? 把酒问青天… 」', 'The first two syllables of the song strike your heart like stones falling into a pond. You know this one, of course.', '我欲乘风归去、又恐琼楼玉宇、高处不胜寒。', '起舞弄清影、何似在人间？', 'Suqing’s voice stumbles rough and unpracticed through the lyrics, the tones falling flat. You sing with her, you lift her voice. No portal opens between you—that kind of magic takes time and concentration—but you feel the stirrings of a connection, the right kind of purity. You fall asleep with the words lingering between you, as if you were back on the originworld, entwined with another under the moonlight, the sound of nesting swallows above your head.', '人有悲欢离合、月有阴晴圆缺、 此事古难全。但愿人长久、千里共婵娟。', '\\xa0', 'Three weeks pass by like water in a river. A fresh processing officer joins you in the portal room as you prepare to resume your duties. A mountain of work awaits you: Shipments of perishable goods, important documents, and luxury items hunger for their destinations. Eighth Colony seethes with impatience after so long with no portal contact to other places. And it’s an impatience you share, but for other reasons: your heart gladdens at the thought of being immersed in Ren’s song again.', 'You raise your voice: 怒发冲冠，凭栏处…', 'The voice that joins yours is unexpected: low and smoke-roughened. 抬望眼、仰天长啸、壮怀激烈。', 'The alien timbre of the words startles you so much, the song stalls in your throat. Aborted in half-formation, the portal dissipates into white mist. The processing officer frowns. “Ansible? What are you doing?”', 'Ren, your Ren, your Wang-sun. Where is she? Is she still on leave? Why have they put a stranger, some unknown exocluster ansible, in her place?', '“Ansible Xin,” the processing officer says, irritation in his tone. “We cannot afford any further delays.”', 'You have no choice. Three weeks of unspent work stands ahead of you. Shaking, shaken, you take up the song again, and the stranger on the originworld responds.', 'Your songs don’t match; you can barely hold the portal open wide enough. You don’t know who the strange ansible is or where she comes from. You don’t know her name. These things matter. All the time spent together in the temple was not for nothing. 三十功名尘与土、八千里路云和月。You feel like collapsing.', 'There’s still a good half left to the shipments when the processing officer leaves in a cloud of frustration, muttering about your worthlessness. You are done for the day.', 'Where is Ren?', '\\xa0', 'Suqing tries to break the news gently. But the look on her face tells you everything. The exhaust-heat in this secluded service corridor can’t fight off the chill in your bones.', '“The Imperial Authority thought your cluster leader was compromised,” she says. “The corpse that came through here should have never left the originworld in the first place. So they decided to…” She picks her mind for words, her brow creased. “They decided to dispose of her.”', 'The replacement Ren was taken from the ship ansible program, where they don’t form clusters, where they are trained to be flexible. A stopgap.', 'You won’t let Suqing touch you, won’t let her comfort you. Traitor’s bloodfilled death stalks, sharp-toothed and slavering, through your memory. You think of Ren’s soft flesh disintegrating between lines of magebright, imagine her sweet voice torn by screams until the vocal cords are stripped away.', '“They wouldn’t have executed her like that,” Suqing tells you. “She wasn’t a traitor. To them she was just a malfunctioning ansible.”', 'You know she’s trying to make you feel better. But the words sting. You are not a broken part to be replaced. “Leave me alone,” you hiss. You refuse to look at her until she withdraws.', '\\xa0', 'That night, after hours of deliberation and a slow settling of your mood, you go to her quarters. The door has barely shut behind you when you say: “I wish to take part in rebellious activities”.', 'Colour and expression drain from her face as though your words have punctured her somewhere. “What are you saying?”', '“I want to avenge Wang-sun. Introduce me to your rebellion.”', 'Her breathing quickens. “You’ve gone mad. I can’t do that.”', '“Don’t lie to me.”', '“It’s not a lie, I—”', '“I know where you go when you slip out at night for your walks. I know what’s happening on the evenings you tell me not to meet.”', 'She hides her eyes from you, momentarily. “Do you?”', '“I know you keep things in the drawers you ask me not to open.”', 'Her face crumples in a frown. “Those are just family treasures. You—”', '“The other day I saw you and Quartermaster Lu whispering together. When I came closer you stopped. What were you talking about?”', 'She puts space between you. “Listen to yourself talk. Do you know what’s at stake? You’ve seen what they do to traitors.”', 'You close the space she’s tried to make. “It doesn’t matter. My cluster has been broken. Ren is gone. They’re only waiting until they can replace us. I am already dead, it is decided.”', 'Suqing grimaces. “I won’t do this. Leave me alone if you have nothing else to ask.” She retreats into the bedchamber and locks the door, a mechanical click that you would have to break into. You stand in the cold air of her room, waiting for her to re-emerge and recant her declarations, but she does not.', '\\xa0', 'There’s a gap of hours before the knock comes on your door. You have been half-expecting it, half-dreading it. Suqing stands on the other side, the broad lines of her face taut and solid. “Come with me.” That’s all she says.', 'She leads you silently and rapidly through the backdoor byways of Eighth Colony: unpatrolled, unadorned corridors with exposed piping and unfinished metal walls. For the first ten minutes of your journey she walks without talking, and you match her strides, equally silent. Blood sings in your ears, and your heart is a drum to accompany it.', 'Then Suqing says: “When you asked to accompany me, I was in a dilemma. I suspected a trap. It seemed too convenient. First exposing my preferences for women, then trying to catch us in treasonous activities. I had a moment of doubt. I suspected the Authority’s involvement.”', 'A reasonable fear. “What changed your mind?”', '“Nothing, actually. I just thought, I don’t want to live with this kind of fear and doubt all my life. Where even expressions of love have to be taken with suspicion.”', 'She comes to a stop before the entrance of a pump room, its door thick and heavy, the muffled roar of machinery thrumming from within. “Once you step through this door, there is no turning back. Are you sure about this? Do you know why you’re doing it?”', 'You are doing it for Ren. For Wang-sun. Your sorrow for her is overwhelming. How pitiful that she died helpless, at the mercy of the forces that have dictated the form and shape of your life. You have determined that this will not be your fate.', 'You straighten your spine and sing:「莫等闲白了少年头、空悲切。」', 'Suqing dips her head in understanding, and unlocks the room door with her mage’s touch.', '\\xa0', 'Over the next few hours and the next few days you learn many things. You suspected some of them, others catch you blind.', 'You learn that the roots of the rebellion have spread far and wide in Eighth Colony. They go deeper than you had imagined. Nearly half the Authority officers are active participants, and they are in every branch of operations.', 'You learn that of the four starmages on the colony, three have been recruited to the cause. The fourth, Officer Yao, is an Authority man, through and through. It cannot be helped. It is enough.', 'You learn that Quartermaster Lu leads the Eighth Colony rebels. When you ask if it feels strange to give orders to starmages, he laughs. “There is no place for that sort of hierarchy in the rebellion. We must purge ourselves and our movement of such toxic ways of thinking!”', 'You learn that the corpse that started your recent troubles was in fact a message from comrades on the originworld. Secrets and messages had been whispered into the dead man’s ear before he had been slaughtered. The map of his viscera has been pinned up in the pump room, Starmage Wu’s spidery interpretations scrawling downwards beside it. Gut-reading is an old art long fallen out of practice, but Starmage Wu had taught himself as a young man. The Starmage General had gotten so jittery around the Imperial Executioner’s visit that normal lines of communication were no longer safe.', 'You ask Quartermaster Lu: “So he was not really your cousin? That was a lie?”', '“He was my cousin. But he was becoming a liability to the movement.” Since he had to die, his body might as well be made good use of. His death was regrettable, but it couldn’t be helped.', 'So, too, was Traitor’s. When she was caught, it was decided that saving her would only expose the movement to more danger, more executions. Starmage Jiang had visited her, quietly wiped her memories, so she could not reveal anyone else. She had died not even knowing her crimes.', 'You notice how uncomfortable Suqing becomes whenever Traitor is mentioned. Her name, you remind yourself, was Siyun.', 'Rebellion is imminent. Four of the Colonies have agreed to coordinate, overthrowing the Imperial Authority on the same day, declaring themselves independent.', 'Only the starmages have the ability to defeat the Starmage General. But their suits have a limiter that stops them from performing the Seventy Two Transformations, and that is under the Starmage General’s control. It is possible to bypass the limiters, but the materials needed to do so come from the originworld, and that shipment was interrupted by the Imperial Executioner’s visit.', '“But we have the ansible on our side now,” says Quartermaster Lu. He thumps you heartily on the back.', '“What of the processing officer?” you ask. “The new one detests me. Surely he will notice something amiss.”', '“That’s Officer Xiao, isn’t it? He’s new to the colony.” Starmage Wu rubs his chin and looks at Suqing. “I hear he has his eye on you. He’s ambitious. That might work.”', 'Suqing flushes. “I don’t understand what you mean.”', '“Come on, Ouyang,” Quartermaster Lu says. “Surely even a deviant like you can distract a man for a mere few minutes.”', '\\xa0', 'It takes more than a few minutes. For safety’s sake, Suqing’s flirtations with the man have to stretch across the week. The excuse is that, due to your poor performance, she has been sent to oversee you. While you sing your broken, mismatched song, she bats her eyelids and recites the lines Starmage Wu taught her. Her delivery is so glasslike and stiff you wonder how he believes it. But he is smitten. Somewhere between his posturing and Suqing’s unconvincing lip-biting, you receive a package wrapped in red cloth, mage-touched to hide it from scrutiny.', 'You cannot believe it worked.', 'Quartermaster Lu is predictably delighted, clapping Suqing on the back. He likes doing this, you realise, his boisterous laugh louder if the recipient of his gesture flinches. “Looks like you’ve truly got it in you, Ouyang. Are you sure you really like women that much?”', '“I can vouch for that,” you say to him, as Suqing’s lips thin.', 'Quartermaster Lu guffaws. “This one has spirit! I like her.” And he looks at you with a smile that means he does not like you, at all.', 'Suqing takes your hand. It is done. Nothing stands between the colony and its destiny now.', '\\xa0', 'On the eve of the rebellion you lie with Suqing, one last exultation before the fall. You kiss her pale, damp skin, caressing the dips and curves that glow with implant light. How familiar this has become, as though everything that passed before had been a dream, and this has been the only reality you’ve known.', 'Eventually the both of you fall quiet, urgent caresses subsiding into a loose, comfortable tangle of limbs. “Are you frightened?” you ask.', 'Suqing blinks and looks out at the stoic, unjudgemental stars. “I’ve already done the most frightening thing I can think of.”', '“Why did you do it? Why did you approach me, after so many years?”', 'She grips your hand. “The path of rebellion is lined with death,” she says. “And I didn’t want to die full of regrets.”', 'You bury your face in her fragrant shoulder. “You’re not allowed to die.”', 'She lifts your chin. “Surely my life is worth the freedom of the people? One life is not that much of a price to pay.”', 'You say nothing. Your mind struggles to construct the memory of the faces you have loved: Ren’s pale softness, the bright lines of your long-gone Mingyue. It’s like building a bridge out of smoke.', 'Your silence is not lost on Suqing. She kisses your fevered brow. “What happens, will happen,” she says. “We shouldn’t fight it.”', '“Aren’t we fighting for the right to choose our destinies?”', 'She breathes out. “Yes,” she says finally. “Yes, we are. And this is what we’ve chosen.”', 'She has nightmares about Siyun’s death, still. You do too. Sometimes you dream that it’s Suqing in Traitor’s place. Sometimes you dream it’s you.', '“After tomorrow,” Suqing says, as though reading your mind, “it won’t happen again.”', 'You press your chest against hers and softly begin the song you two chose for yourselves: 明月几时有？把酒问青天。Suqing’s voice joins yours, and in the cadence of her tone, snug as a glove, you feel a familiar resonance. And instead of fighting it you let it envelope you. You are falling into her song, as she is falling into yours, and her eyes are wide as a connection opens between you, a portal that transcends space and time.', '不知天上宫阙、今夕是何年？', '“We did it,” she whispers, as the song ends.', 'You press your heads together. “Now nothing in the universe can keep us apart.”', '\\xa0', 'You have never witnessed starmages in battle. Same as ordinary citizens, you have only read the poetry, heard the songs, tried to imagine the shape and sound of these battles. The things which are happening now defy the imagination, defy sense of scale, defy understanding. Creatures the size of mountains tear each other apart in the cold field of space. Two dragons battle, sinuous bodies twisting past the glass belly of Eighth Colony’s main atrium. The blood-slick scales that glide by are bigger than human heads. One dragon struggles to hold the other still. A third creature, a tiger that could swallow suns, slashes its world-splitting claws through dragonscale.', 'You can only guess which one is Suqing. And guesses are worth nothing in the arena of war.', 'Dragontail strikes glass and cracks spider across its surface. Amid cries of fear and consternation and the beat of your heart you whisper a mantra: It’s alright. It’s alright. She won’t let anything happen to us.', 'The citizenry clots the main atrium, bodies pushing against bodies until sweat and exhalation turns the air to thick and unbreathable soup. Terrible things transpire outside the atrium, but all that filters past the double-layered steel doors are muffled explosions and a great sense of fear. Fringes cling to foreheads, parents cling to children, and your grey tunic clings to the small of your back. A gun naps in your hands, warm and heavy, and as you patrol the atrium, intrusive thoughts of your fellow rebels follow you like a pack of wolves: What if you dropped it? What if it went off?', 'A woman pulls a small boy close as you walk past, and her eyes trail you as you continue your patrol. The citizenry are gathered here to protect them from the fighting; they are not hostages, or prisoners. This, too, is what they have been told.', 'In the center of the atrium the sculpture that used to be Traitor shimmers in the light of battle.', 'Something explodes in the station and you fall. Gun clatters against metal as the lights go out, and the deep bass thrum of the air system falls silent as if shot. People scream, and something—someone—strikes your jaw as the pushing starts, the angry, panicked shoving. You scramble to your feet, fearing a stampede, a loss of order, the loss of life. The gun—you see it on the floor, and you dive desperately for it. As your fingers close around the barrel something kicks you in the back. A foot crushes your hand. You scream.', 'The lights come back on and the air system starts again, unsteady and shuddering, as if the station is having problems drawing breath. Your hand pulses red-hot with pain as you get to your feet, and you don’t want to look at it, don’t want to see if there’s blood. The gun didn’t go off. That’s something to be thankful for. The other rebels are screaming instructions to the citizenry, to each other. Everyone seems to have forgotten about you.', 'Behind you someone starts crying.', 'Eighth Colony fills with thunder as the starmages crash into it. People fall and scream. The glass splinters further. Miraculously it holds, or you think it holds, because none of you are dying now, nobody is being sucked out to space. Pressed against the straining glass, the body of a dragon blots out the stars, and it is oddly, strangely green. It glows. Something is happening, something so powerful it shreds through the part of you that’s all gift.', 'If you call to Suqing now, would it help her? Or kill her?', 'The green flares, it burns your eyes, it consumes the shapes of the battling starmages. You drop the gun and cover your face with a cry. A quake tears through your gift. All falls silent, and remains silent. Then the slow babble of the citizenry rises up, a confused clamor of voices and exclamation.', 'Very slowly, you lower your hands. Beyond the cracked glass of the atrium lies only starfield. The starmages are gone. You allow yourself to breathe, but air burns through your lungs, and you too can taste vinegar in your throat as your stomach clenches into a small ball.', 'The sounds of strife outside the atrium fade; all that’s left are indistinct shouting voices. The sound of boots, quick and heavy against metal. Two gunshots, very brisk, very loud, very close by. And then nothing.', 'Your knees hurt and your calves are trembling. You should either sit down or keep patrolling, but you can’t bring yourself to do either.', '“You,” shouts one of the rebels, a dough-faced man with buzz-cut hair. You remember his name, you do, it’s Sung—was it Sung? He’s shouting instructions at you, his wide blunt fingers pointing, gesturing, but the words don’t register. They are only sounds, whistling through the heat in your ears.', 'The main atrium doors groan as if they are being pulled apart by force, and a gasp goes up from the citizenry. As the doors rumble open, ten feet high and double-reinforced with steel, you tighten your grip on the gun, ignoring the pain in your broken fingers.', 'The first person through is a young rebel, her clothes and hair marked by blood. “Rejoice,” she shouts, “we are victorious.”', 'Cries go up from the other rebels, cheers and ululations. Your throat remains sandpaper-dry, your chest a metal vise. The citizenry around you stay likewise quiet and tight-lipped. A coup is a coup is a coup, and a bullet can kill you regardless of ideology.', '“Tian?”', 'You see her through the gaps in the rebels flooding the room, through the confusion of the citizenry. Suqing, battered and exhausted, but alive. Alive.', 'You run to her, feet getting caught on things as she stumbles towards you. Your shin connects with something, a person or their belongings, you’re not sure which, but you’ve flung your arms out already, you can’t move fast enough. Suqing smells of blood and sulphur and ozone, and her armor bruises your chest, but you don’t care. You don’t want to let her go.', '“You still live,” you say. “I was so afraid.”', '“My love.” The starmage kisses you on the mouth, in public, where everyone can see. Her embrace is raw force, teeth clashing against lips, arms lifting you off your feet. The world tilts and your stomach plummets in free fall—can you dare to hope that for once, something is going right?', 'Suqing seizes your hands when she releases you to the world again. Her reddened cheeks shine with a mad sort of joy, the madness that comes with great struggle coming to fruition. “Come,” she says, squeezing your fingers. You ignore the pain. “There’s a meeting of the leaders, we must attend.”', 'And so you leave the atrium and its multitudes behind, in the care of the ordinary rebels not invited to this high-level meeting. Suqing leads you through the death-lined guts of Eighth Colony, speckled with the corpses of Authority officers. The rebels jog between and around these mounds of flesh on the floor. Loose shoes, badges. Dark trickles of liquid smeared across metal in the pattern of boot prints. You breathe through your mouth and start keeping your line of sight above shoulder level.', 'The blood splatters on the wall look like roses.', '“What now?” The question fills the space between Suqing and you.', '“No one knows,” she says. “This is just the beginning; our struggle is far from over. There will be days and months to come, and no one can predict what they will bring.”', 'She stops in the middle of the carnage and turns to you, her smile wide and bright as you’ve ever seen. “But we’ll be together. Now nothing will come between us.”', 'The path of the corridors closes in on the pump room where you first got entangled in all this. In front of it stands the shape of Quartermaster Lu.', 'He has a gun in his hands.', 'He raises the gun as you draw near.', 'Suqing angles her body so that she and her mage suit stand between you and the gun muzzle. “What’s going on?”', 'Quartermaster Lu’s face is sweat-slick but businesslike, calm as a storm cloud drifting across a summer’s courtyard. “The rebellion has succeeded. Now we must cut the last ties to the parasitic Authority.”', 'This, you realise, with a thick muddy sinking of your stomach contents, means you. The gun is meant for you.', 'Suqing’s brow knits. “You doubt my loyalty to the cause? Because of my family?” She still doesn’t understand.', '“It’s not you.” You stare Quartermaster Lu in the face, daring him to crack, to show even the slightest hint of remorse. “You’re talking about me, aren’t you?”', '“I don’t understand.” Suqing takes a step backwards, moving closer to you. “She wouldn’t betray us!”', '“Not by choice. But she’s an ansible. She’s an open connection. Someone from the Authority could get through her, send things over. It’s too dangerous.”', '“That’s not how it works!” Suqing’s anger and frustration boils over. “I’ve learned the method, it has to be a two-way connection!”', '“We cannot take the risk. Ouyang, it cannot be helped.”', 'Suqing’s hands tighten into fists. “Like Siyun’s death couldn’t be helped?”', 'Your face burns, your breath burns. You hiss: “I joined the rebellion so my fate wouldn’t be decided by men like you.”', 'The gun points to your face. “Think of the good of the cause,” says Quartermaster Lu, his tone flat. You clench your fists, ignoring the pain that flares through the broken one. Could you strike him, and then run?', '“Everything I’ve done has been for the good of the cause,” Suqing says. “Not anymore.”', 'She grabs your hand, your swollen broken hand, and the pain keeps you anchored as her gift flares.', 'The world distorts, goes grey, and then muffled. Time stops. Quartermaster Lu’s face is frozen in the half-expression rictus of a new word. The breath of the station’s air system morphs into a loud, constant drone.', '“What is this?” you ask, words shaky.', '“This is in-between.” Suqing breathes like she’s climbing mountains. “You access it with your gift. You don’t learn this as ansibles?”', 'You learn nothing as ansibles. They teach you to be nothing but a conduit.', 'Suqing pulls at you as you run. “We haven’t got much time,” she gasps. How long can she hold on? You follow after her in a daze, one foot in front of the other, unable to absorb how strange all this is. Your gift sings and sings, a mosquito chorus you’ve never been allowed to hear. In the grey half-light of the in-between the dead bodies littering the corridors seem more like part of the station than anything else. Woven into the fabric of the world.', '“What’s your plan?” you ask.', '“You run. Somewhere they cannot find you.”', '“What about you?”', '“Don’t worry about me.”', 'You end up on the docking platform, the struts familiar over your head. By this time Suqing’s face is red with exertion, and you crash out of the in-between into the sound and smell of the ordinary world. You catch her as she falls to her knees. “Are you alright?”', 'Suqing pushes past the harsh breathing to get to her feet. “I’m fine. Only tired.” She points you towards one of the lightspeed cocoons, marked red-on-grey, massive and industrial. A planetary supply cocoon, in transit. “We’ll take that one.”', 'The cocoon seats one, just like the vehicle that brought you here years ago. You repeat, “Suqing, what about you?”', '“Don’t worry about me. Quartermaster Lu needs me. He cannot dispose of me so easily. Not yet.” The cocoon’s navigation panel lights up under her touch, and she enters coordinates. “Please hurry,” she tells you. “Strap in.”', 'You glance at the docking platform doors, wide open, and realise it’s only a matter of time before the rebels find you.', 'You wanted to decide your own fate. You wanted to fight for it.', '“Take me to a place where there are wide and deep fields,” you say. “A place where grains grow plump and cherry blossom flourishes.”', '“There’s a sparsely populated planet, not a few light-years from here,” Suqing says. “Farmers, dependable folk. They won’t question too much.”', 'The safety belts click across your chest and hips with a sober finality. “And you? Will you join me?”', 'She comes to your side, forehead finding yours, limbs trembling, breaths ghosting against your skin. “Yes,” she whispers. “I will. I promise. I promise.”', 'You don’t want to let her go.', 'Suqing takes in a shaking breath, and then the rough steps of her melody surround you: 明月几时有? 把酒问青天…', 'You sing, matching her tone. 人有悲欢离合、月有阴晴圆缺、 此事古难全。 Warmth floods around you, the connection that cannot be erased. A song, written in the long ages when your people lived on a single planet, shared the same moon. Yet the sentiment is unchanged.', 'Light glows between the two of you. 但愿人长久、千里共婵娟。', 'You kiss her face, her lips, her hair. You taste the blood on them. You taste the sweat, the fear, the desperation, the hope. What the future holds, you cannot say. But you have your song. It is all that you have, and you have to pray that it will be enough.', '\\xa0', '“Waiting on a Bright Moon” copyright © 2017 by JY Yang', 'Art copyright © 2017 by Victo Ngai']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['The Martian Obelisk'], 'Author': ['Linda Nagata'], 'Body': ['A powerful science fiction story about an architect on Earth commissioned to create (via long distance) a masterwork with materials from the last abandoned Martian colony, a monument that will last thousands of years longer than Earth, which is dying.', '\\xa0', 'The end of the world required time to accomplish—and time, Susannah reflected, worked at the task with all the leisurely skill of a master torturer, one who could deliver death either quickly or slowly, but always with excruciating pain.', 'No getting out of it.', 'But there were still things to do in the long, slow decline; final gestures to make. Susannah Li-Langford had spent seventeen years working on her own offering-for-the-ages, with another six and half years to go before the Martian Obelisk reached completion. Only when the last tile was locked into place in the obelisk’s pyramidal cap, would she yield.', 'Until then, she did what was needed to hold onto her health, which was why, at the age of eighty, she was out walking vigorously along the cliff trail above the encroaching Pacific Ocean, determined to have her daily exercise despite the brisk wind and the freezing mist that ran before it. The mist was only a token moisture, useless to revive the drought-stricken coastal forest, but it made the day cold enough that the fishing platforms at the cliff’s edge were deserted, leaving Susannah alone to contemplate the mortality of the human world.', 'It was not supposed to happen like this. As a child she’d been promised a swift conclusion: duck and cover and nuclear annihilation. And if not annihilation, at least the nihilistic romance of a gun-toting, leather-clad, fight-to-the-death anarchy.', 'That hadn’t happened either.', 'Things had just gotten worse, and worse still, and people gave up. Not everyone, not all at once—there was no single event marking the beginning of the end—but there was a sense of inevitability about the direction history had taken. Sea levels rose along with average ocean temperatures. Hurricanes devoured coastal cities and consumed low-lying countries. Agriculture faced relentless drought, flood, and temperature extremes. A long run of natural disasters made it all worse—earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions. There had been no major meteor strike yet, but Susannah wouldn’t bet against it. Health care faltered as antibiotics became useless against resistant bacteria. Surgery became an art of the past.', 'Out of the devastation, war and terrorism erupted like metastatic cancers.', ', Susannah thought. ', '.', 'There were reactor meltdowns, poisoned water supplies, engineered plagues, and a hundred other, smaller horrors. The Shoal War had seen nuclear weapons used in the South China Sea. But even the most determined ghouls had failed to ignite a sudden, brilliant cataclysm. The master torturer would not be rushed.', 'Still, the tipping point was long past, the future truncated. Civilization staggered on only in the lucky corners of the world where the infrastructure of a happier age still functioned. Susannah lived in one of those lucky corners, not far from the crumbling remains of Seattle, where she had greenhouse food, a local network, and satellite access all supplied by her patron, Nathaniel Sanchez, who was the money behind the Martian Obelisk.', 'When the audio loop on her ear beeped a quiet tone, she assumed the alert meant a message from Nate. There was no one else left in her life, nor did she follow the general news, because what was the point?', 'She tapped the corner of her wrist-link with a finger gloved against the cold, signaling her personal AI to read the message aloud. Its artificial, androgynous voice spoke into her ear:', '“Message sender: Martian Obelisk Operations. Message body: Anomaly sighted. All operations automatically halted pending supervisory approval.”', 'Just a few innocuous words, but weighted with a subtext of disaster.', 'A subtext all too familiar.', 'For a few seconds, Susannah stood still in the wind and the rushing mist. In the seventeen-year history of the project, construction had been halted only for equipment maintenance, and that, on a tightly regulated schedule. She raised her wrist-link to her lips. “What anomaly, Alix?” she demanded, addressing the AI. “Can it be identified?”', '“It identifies as a homestead vehicle belonging to Red Oasis.”', 'That was absurd. Impossible.', 'Founded twenty-one years ago, Red Oasis was the first of four Martian colonies, and the most successful. It had outlasted all the others, but the Mars Era had ended nine months ago when Red Oasis succumbed to an outbreak of “contagious asthma”—a made-up name for an affliction evolved on Mars.', 'Since then there had been only radio silence. The only active elements on the planet were the wind, and the machinery that had not yet broken down, all of it operated by AIs.', '“Where is the vehicle?” Susannah asked.', '“Seventeen kilometers northwest of the obelisk.”', 'How was that possible? Red Oasis was over 5,000 kilometers distant. How could an AI have driven so far? And who had given the order?', 'Homestead vehicles were not made to cover large distances. They were big, slow, and cumbersome—cross-country robotic crawlers designed to haul equipment from the landing site to a colony’s permanent location, where construction would commence (and ideally be completed) long before the inhabitants arrived. The vehicles had a top speed of fifteen kilometers per hour which meant that even with the lightspeed delay, Susannah had time to send a new instruction set to the AIs that inhabited her construction equipment.', 'Shifting abruptly from stillness to motion, she resumed her vigorous pace—and then she pushed herself to walk just a little faster.', '\\xa0', 'Nathaniel Sanchez was waiting for her, pacing with a hobbling gait on the front porch of her cottage when she returned. His flawless electric car, an anomaly from another age, was parked in the gravel driveway. Nate was eighty-five and rail-thin, but the electric warmth of his climate-controlled coat kept him comfortable even in the biting wind. She waved at him impatiently. “You know it’s fine to let yourself in. I was hoping you’d have coffee brewing by now.”', 'He opened the door for her, still a practitioner of the graceful manners instilled in him by his mother eight decades ago—just one of the many things Susannah admired about him. His trustworthiness was another. Though Nate owned every aspect of the Martian Obelisk project—the equipment on Mars, the satellite accounts, this house where Susannah expected to live out her life—he had always held fast to an early promise never to interfere with her design or her process.', '“I haven’t been able to talk to anyone associated with Red Oasis,” he told her in a voice low and resonant with age. “The support network may have disbanded.”', 'She sat down in the old, armless chair she kept by the door, and pulled off her boots. “Have the rights to Red Oasis gone on the market yet?”', '“No.” Balancing with one hand against the door, he carefully stepped out of his clogs. “If they had, I would have bought them.”', '“What about a private transfer?”', 'He offered a hand to help her up. “I’ve got people looking into it. We’ll find out soon.”', 'In stockinged feet, she padded across the hardwood floor and the hand-made carpets of the living room, but at the door of the Mars room she hesitated, looking back at Nate. Homesteads were robotic vehicles, but they were designed with cabs that could be pressurized for human use, with a life-support system that could sustain two passengers for many days. “Is there any chance some of the colonists at Red Oasis are still alive?” Susannah asked.', 'Nate reached past her to open the door, a dark scowl on his worn face. “No detectable activity and radio silence for nine months? I don’t think so. There’s no one in that homestead, Susannah, and there’s no good reason for it to visit the obelisk, especially without any notice to us that it was coming. When my people find out who’s issuing the orders we’ll get it turned around, but in the meantime, do what you have to do to take care of our equipment.”', 'Nate had always taken an interest in the Martian Obelisk, but over the years, as so many of his other aspirations failed, the project had become more personal. He had begun to see it as his own monument and himself as an Ozymandias whose work was doomed to be forgotten, though it would not fall to the desert sands in this lifetime or any other.', '\\xa0', '“What can I do for you, Susannah?” he had asked, seventeen years ago.', 'A long-time admirer of her architectural work, he had come to her after the ruin of the Holliday Towers in Los Angeles—her signature project—two soaring glass spires, one eighty-four floors and the other 104, linked by graceful sky bridges. When the Hollywood Quake struck, the buildings had endured the shaking just as they’d been designed to do, keeping their residents safe, while much of the city around them crumbled. But massive fires followed the quake and the towers had not survived that.', '“Tell me what you dream of, Susannah. What you would still be willing to work on.”', 'Nathaniel had been born into wealth, and through the first half of his life he’d grown the family fortune. Though he had never been among the wealthiest individuals of the world, he could still indulge extravagant fancies.', 'The request Susannah made of him had been, literally, outlandish.', '“Buy me the rights to the Destiny Colony.”', '“On Mars?” His tone suggested a suspicion that her request might be a joke.', '“On Mars,” she assured him.', 'Destiny had been the last attempt at Mars colonization. The initial robotic mission had been launched and landed, but money ran out and colonists were never sent. The equipment sat on Mars, unused.', 'Susannah described her vision of the Martian Obelisk: a gleaming, glittering white spire, taking its color from the brilliant white of the fiber tiles she would use to construct it. It would rise from an empty swell of land, growing more slender as it reached into the sparse atmosphere, until it met an engineering limit prescribed by the strength of the fiber tiles, the gravity of the Red Planet, and by the fierce ghost-fingers of Mars’ storm winds. Calculations of the erosional force of the Martian wind led her to conclude that the obelisk would still be standing a hundred thousand years hence and likely far longer. It would outlast all buildings on Earth. It would outlast her bloodline, and all bloodlines. It would still be standing long after the last human had gone the way of the passenger pigeon, the right whale, the dire wolf. In time, the restless Earth would swallow up all evidence of human existence, but the Martian Obelisk would remain—a last monument marking the existence of humankind, excepting only a handful of tiny, robotic spacecraft faring, lost and unrecoverable, in the void between stars.', 'Nate had listened carefully to her explanation of the project, how it could be done, and the time that would be required. None of it fazed him and he’d agreed, without hesitation, to support her.', 'The rights to the colony’s equipment had been in the hands of a holding company that had acquired ownership in bankruptcy court. Nathaniel pointed out that no one was planning to go to Mars again, that no one any longer possessed the wealth or resources to try. Before long, he was able to purchase Destiny Colony for a tiny fraction of the original backers’ investment.', 'When Susannah received the command codes, Destiny’s homestead vehicle had not moved from the landing site, its payload had not been unpacked, and construction on its habitat had never begun. Her first directive to the AI in charge of the vehicle was to drive it three hundred kilometers to the site she’d chosen for the obelisk, at the high point of a rising swell of land.', 'Once there, she’d unloaded the fleet of robotic construction equipment: a mini-dozer, a mini-excavator, a six-limbed beetle cart to transport finished tiles, and a synth—short for synthetic human although the device was no such thing. It was just a stick figure with two legs, two arms, and hands capable of basic manipulation.', 'The equipment fleet also included a rolling factory that slowly but continuously produced a supply of fiber tiles, compiling them from raw soil and atmospheric elements. While the factory produced an initial supply of tiles, Susannah prepared the foundation of the obelisk, and within a year she began to build.', 'The Martian Obelisk became her passion, her reason for life after every other reason had been taken from her. Some called it a useless folly. She didn’t argue: what meaning could there be in a monument that would never be seen directly by human eyes? Some called it graffiti: ', ' Some called it a tombstone and that was the truth too.', 'Susannah just called it better-than-nothing.', '\\xa0', 'The Mars room was a circular extension that Nathaniel had ordered built onto the back of the cottage when Susannah was still in the planning stages of the obelisk’s construction. When the door was closed, the room became a theater with a 360-degree floor-to-ceiling flex-screen. A high-backed couch at the center rotated, allowing easy viewing of the encircling images captured in high resolution from the construction site.', 'Visually, being in this room was like being at Destiny, and it did not matter at all that each red-tinted image was a still shot, because on the Red Planet, the dead planet, change came so slowly that a still shot was as good as video.', 'Until now.', 'As Susannah entered the room, she glimpsed an anomalous, bright orange spot in a lowland to the northwest. Nathaniel saw it too. He gestured and started to speak but she waved him to silence, taking the time to circle the room, scanning the entire panorama to assess if anything else had changed.', 'Her gaze passed first across a long slope strewn with a few rocks and scarred with wheel tracks. Brightly colored survey sticks marked the distance: yellow at 250 meters, pink at 500, green for a full kilometer, and bright red for two.', 'The red stick stood at the foot of a low ridge that nearly hid the tile factory. She could just see an upper corner of its bright-green, block shape. The rest of it was out of sight, busy as always, processing raw ore dug by the excavator from a pit beyond the ridge, and delivered by the mini-dozer. As the factory slowly rolled, it left a trail of tailings, and every few minutes it produced a new fiber tile.', 'Next in the panorama was a wide swath of empty land, more tire tracks the only sign of human influence all the way out to a hazy pink horizon. And then, opposite the door and appearing no more than twenty meters distant, was Destiny’s homestead vehicle. It was the same design as the approaching crawler: a looming cylindrical cargo container resting on dust-filled tracks. At the forward end, the cab, its windows dusty and lightless, its tiny bunkroom never used. Susannah had long ago removed the equipment she wanted, leaving all else in storage. For over sixteen years, the homestead had remained in its current position, untouched except by the elements.', 'Passing the Destiny homestead, her gaze took in another downward slope of lifeless desert and then, near the end of her circuit, she faced the tower itself.', 'The Martian Obelisk stood alone at the high point of the surrounding land, a gleaming-white, graceful, four-sided, tapering spire, already 170-meters high, sharing the sky with no other object. The outside walls were smooth and unadorned, but on the inside, a narrow stairway climbed around the core, rising in steep flights to the tower’s top, where more fiber tiles were added every day, extending its height. It was a path no human would ever walk, but the beetle cart, with its six legs, ascended every few hours, carrying in its cargo basket a load of fiber tiles. Though she couldn’t see the beetle cart, its position was marked as inside the tower, sixty percent of the way up the stairs. The synth waited for it at the top, its headless torso just visible over the rim of the obelisk’s open stack, ready to use its supple hands to assemble the next course of tiles.', 'All this was as expected, as it should be.', 'Susannah steadied herself with a hand against the high back of the couch as she finally considered the orange splash of color that was the intruding vehicle. “Alix, distance to the Red Oasis homestead?”', 'The same androgynous voice that inhabited her ear loop spoke now through the room’s sound system. “Twelve kilometers.”', 'The homestead had advanced five kilometers in the twenty minutes she’d taken to return to the cottage—though in truth it was really much closer. Earth and Mars were approaching a solar conjunction, when they would be at their greatest separation, on opposite sides of the Sun. With the lightspeed delay, even this new image was nineteen minutes old. So she had only minutes left to act.', 'Reaching down to brace herself against the armrest of the couch, she sat with slow grace. “Alix, give me a screen.”', 'A sleeve opened in the armrest and an interface emerged, swinging into an angled display in front of her.', 'The fires that had destroyed the Holliday Towers might have been part of the general inferno sparked by the Hollywood earthquake, but Susannah suspected otherwise. The towers had stood as a symbol of defiance amid the destruction—which might explain why they were brought low. The Martian Obelisk was a symbol too, and it had long been a target both for the media and for some of Destiny’s original backers who had wanted the landing left undisturbed, for the use of a future colonization mission that no one could afford to send.', '“Start up our homestead,” Nate urged her. “It’s the only equipment we can afford to risk. If you drive it at an angle into the Red Oasis homestead, you might be able to push it off its tracks.”', 'Susannah frowned, her fingers moving across the screen as she assembled an instruction set. “That’s a last resort option, Nate, and I’m not even sure it’s possible. There are safety protocols in the AIs’ core training modules that might prevent it.”', 'She tapped ', ', launching the new instruction set on its nineteen-minute journey. Then she looked at Nate. “I’ve ordered the AIs that handle the construction equipment to retreat and evade. We cannot risk damage or loss of control.”', 'He nodded somberly. “Agreed—but the synth and the beetle cart are in the tower.”', '“They’re safe in there, for now. But I’m going to move the homestead—assuming it starts. After seventeen years, it might not.”', '“Understood.”', '“The easiest way for someone to shut down our operation is to simply park the Red Oasis homestead at the foot of the obelisk, so that it blocks access to the stairway. If the beetle cart can’t get in and out, we’re done. So I’m going to park our homestead there first.”', 'He nodded thoughtfully, eyeing the image of the obelisk. “Okay. I understand.”', '“Our best hope is that you can find out who’s instructing the Red Oasis homestead and get them to back off. But if that fails, I’ll bring the synth out, and use it to try to take manual control.”', '“The Red Oasis group could have a synth too.”', '“Yes.”', 'They might also have explosives—destruction was so much easier than creation—but Susannah did not say this aloud. She did not want Nate to inquire about the explosives that belonged to Destiny. Instead she told him, “There’s no way we can know what they’re planning. All we can do is wait and see.”', 'He smacked a frustrated fist into his palm. “Nineteen minutes! Nineteen minutes times two before we know what’s happened!”', '“Maybe the AIs will work it out on their own,” she said dryly. And then it was her turn to be overtaken by frustration. “Look at us! Look what we’ve come to! Invested in a monument no one will ever see. Squabbling over the possession of ruins while the world dies. This is where our hubris has brought us.” But that was wrong, so she corrected herself. “', 'hubris.”', 'Nate was an old man with a lifetime of emotions mapped on his well-worn face. In that complex terrain it wasn’t always easy to read his current feelings, but she thought she saw hurt there. He looked away, before she could decide. A furtive movement.', '“Nate?” she asked in confusion.', '“This project matters,” he insisted, gazing at the obelisk. “It’s art, and it’s memory, and it ', ' matter.”', 'Of course. But only because it was all they had left.', '“Come into the kitchen,” she said. “I’ll make coffee.”', '\\xa0', 'Nate’s tablet chimed while they were still sitting at the kitchen table. He took the call, listened to a brief explanation from someone on his staff, and then objected. “That can’t be right. No. There’s something else going on. Keep at it.”', 'He scowled at the table until Susannah reminded him she was there. “Well?”', '“That was Davidson, my chief investigator. He tracked down a Red Oasis shareholder who told him that the rights to the colony’s equipment had ', ' been traded or sold, that they couldn’t be, because they had no value. Not with a failed communications system.” His scowl deepened. “They want us to believe they can’t even talk to the AIs.”', 'Susannah stared at him. “But if that’s true—”', '“It’s not.”', '“Meaning you don’t want it to be.” She got up from the table.', '“Susannah—”', '“I’m not going to pretend, Nate. If it’s not an AI driving that homestead, then it’s a colonist, a survivor—and that changes everything.”', '\\xa0', 'She returned to the Mars room, where she sat watching the interloper’s approach. The wall screen refreshed every four minutes as a new image arrived from the other side of the sun. Each time it did, the bright orange homestead jumped a bit closer. It jumped right past the outermost ring of survey sticks, putting it less than two kilometers from the obelisk—close enough that she could see a faint wake of drifting dust trailing behind it, giving it a sense of motion.', 'Then, thirty-eight minutes after she’d sent the new instruction set, the Destiny AI returned an acknowledgement.', 'Her heart beat faster, knowing that whatever was to happen on Mars had already happened. Destiny’s construction equipment had retreated and its homestead had started up or had failed to start, had moved into place at the foot of the tower or not. No way to know until time on Earth caught up with time on Mars.', 'The door opened.', 'Nate shuffled into the room.', 'Susannah didn’t bother to ask if Davidson had turned up anything. She could see from his grim expression that he expected the worst.', 'And what was the worst?', 'A slight smile stole onto her lips as Nate sat beside her on the couch.', 'The worst case is that someone has lived.', 'Was it any wonder they were doomed?', '\\xa0', 'Four more minutes.', 'The image updated.', 'The 360-degree camera, mounted on a steel pole sunk deep into the rock, showed Destiny profoundly changed. For the first time in seventeen years, Destiny’s homestead had moved. It was parked by the tower, just as Susannah had requested. She twisted around, looking for the bright green corner of the factory beyond the distant ridge—but she couldn’t see it.', '“Everything is as ordered,” Susannah said.', 'The Red Oasis homestead had reached the green survey sticks.', '“An AI has to be driving,” Nate insisted.', '“Time will tell.”', 'Nate shook his head. “Time comes with a nineteen minute gap. Truth is in the radio silence. It’s an AI.”', '\\xa0', 'Four more minutes of silence.', 'When the image next refreshed, it showed the two homesteads, nose to nose.', '#', 'Four minutes.', 'The panorama looked the same.', 'Four minutes more.', 'No change.', 'Four minutes.', 'Only the angle of sunlight shifted.', 'Four minutes.', 'A figure in an orange pressure suit stood beside the two vehicles, gazing up at the tower.', '\\xa0', 'Before the Martian Obelisk, when Shaun was still alive, two navy officers in dress uniforms had come to the house, and in formal voices explained that the daughter Susannah had birthed and nurtured and shaped with such care was gone, her future collapsed to nothing by a missile strike in the South China Sea.', '“We must go on,” Shaun ultimately insisted.', 'And they had, bravely.', 'Defiantly.', 'Only a few years later their second child and his young wife had vanished into the chaos brought on by an engineered plague that decimated Hawaii’s population, turning it into a state under permanent quarantine. Day after excruciating day as they’d waited for news, Shaun had grown visibly older, hope a dying light, and when it was finally extinguished he had nothing left to keep him moored to life.', 'Susannah was of a different temper. The cold ferocity of her anger had nailed her into the world. The shape it took was the Martian Obelisk: one last creative act before the world’s end.', 'She knew now the obelisk would never be finished.', '\\xa0', '“It’s a synth,” Nate said. “It has to be.”', 'The AI contradicted him. “Text message,” it announced.', '“Read it,” Susannah instructed.', 'Alix obeyed, reading the message in an emotionless voice. “Message sender: Red Oasis resident Tory Eastman. Message body as transcribed audio: Is anyone out there? Is anyone listening? My name is Tory Eastman. I’m a refugee from Red Oasis. Nineteen days in transit with my daughter and son, twins, three years old. We are the last survivors.”', 'These words induced in Susannah a rush of fear so potent she had to close her eyes against a dizzying sense of vertigo. There was no emotion in the AI’s voice and still she heard in it the anguish of another mother:', '“The habitat was damaged during the emergency. I couldn’t maintain what was left and I had no communications. So I came here. Five thousand kilometers. I need what’s here. I need it all. I need the provisions and I need the equipment and I need the command codes and I need the building materials. I need to build my children a new home. Please. Are you there? Are you an AI? Is anyone left on Earth? Respond. Respond please. Give me the command codes. I will wait.”', 'For many seconds—and many, many swift, fluttering heartbeats—neither Nate nor Susannah spoke. Susannah wanted to speak. She sought for words, and when she couldn’t find them, she wondered: am I in shock? Or is it a stroke?', 'Nate found his voice first: “It’s a hoax, aimed at you, Susannah. They know your history. They’re playing on your emotions. They’re using your grief to wreck this project.”', 'Susannah let out a long breath, and with it, some of the horror that had gripped her. “We humans are amazing,” she mused, “in our endless ability to lie to ourselves.”', 'He shook his head. “Susannah, if I thought this was real—”', 'She held up a hand to stop his objection. “I’m not going to turn over the command codes. Not yet. If you’re right and this is a hoax, I can back out. But if it’s real, that family has pushed the life support capabilities of their homestead to the limit. They can move into our vehicle—that’ll keep them alive for a few days—but they’ll need more permanent shelter soon.”', '“It’ll take months to build a habitat.”', '“', '. It’ll take months to make the tiles to build a habitat—but we already have a huge supply of tiles.”', '“All of our tiles are tied up in the obelisk.”', '“Yes.”', 'He looked at her in shock, struck speechless.', '“It’ll be okay, Nate.”', '“You’re abandoning the project.”', '“If we can help this family survive, we have to do it—and that will be the project we’re remembered for.”', '“Even if there’s no one left to remember?”', 'She pressed her lips tightly together, contemplating the image of the obelisk. Then she nodded. “Even so.”', 'Knowing the pain of waiting, she sent a message of assurance to Destiny Colony before anything else. Then she instructed the synth and the beetle cart to renew their work, but this time in reverse: the synth would unlink the fiber tiles beginning at the top of the obelisk and the beetle would carry them down.', '\\xa0', 'After an hour—after she’d traded another round of messages with a grateful Tory Eastman and begun to lay out a shelter based on a standard Martian habitat—she got up to stretch her legs and relieve her bladder. It surprised her to find Nate still in the living room. He stood at the front window, staring out at the mist that never brought enough moisture into the forest.', '“They’ll be alone forever,” he said without turning around. “There are no more missions planned. No one else will ever go to Mars.”', '“I won’t tell her that.”', 'He looked at her over his shoulder. “So you are willing to sacrifice the obelisk? It was everything to you yesterday, but today you’ll just give it up?”', '“She drove a quarter of the way around the planet, Nate. Would you ever have guessed that was possible?”', '“No,” he said bitterly as he turned back to the window. “No. It should not have been possible.”', '“There’s a lesson for us in that. We assume we can see forward to tomorrow, but we can’t. We can’t ever really know what’s to come—and we can’t know what we might do, until we try.”', '\\xa0', 'When she came out of the bathroom, Nate was sitting down in the rickety old chair by the door. With his rounded shoulders and his thin white hair, he looked old and very frail. “Susannah—”', '“Nate, I don’t want to argue—”', '“Just ', '. I didn’t want to tell you before because, well, you’ve already suffered so many shocks and even good news can come too late.”', '“What are you saying?” she said, irritated with him now, sure that he was trying to undermine her resolve.', '“Hawaii’s been under quarantine because the virus can be latent for—”', 'She guessed where this was going. “For years. I know that. But if you’re trying to suggest that Tory and her children might still succumb to whatever wiped out Red Oasis—”', '“They ', ',” he interrupted, sounding bitter. “But that’s not what I was going to say.”', '“Then what?”', '“Listen, and I’ll tell you. Are you ready to listen?”', '“Yes, yes. Go ahead.”', '“A report came out just a few weeks ago. The latest antivirals worked. The quarantine in Hawaii will continue for several more years, but all indications are the virus is gone. Wiped out. No sign of latent infections in over six months.”', 'Her hands felt numb; she felt barely able to shuffle her feet as she moved to take a seat in an antique armchair. “The virus is gone? How can they know that?”', '“Blood tests. And the researchers say that what they’ve learned can be applied to other contagions. That what happened in Hawaii doesn’t ever have to happen again.”', 'Progress? A reprieve against the long decline?', '“There’s more, Susannah.”', 'The way he said it—his falling tone—it was a warning that set her tired heart pounding.', '“You asked me to act as your agent,” he reminded her. “You asked me to screen all news, and I’ve done that.”', '“Until now.”', '“Until now,” he agreed, looking down, looking frightened by the knowledge he had decided to convey. “I should have told you sooner.”', '“But you didn’t want to risk interrupting work on the obelisk?”', '“You said you didn’t want to hear anything.” He shrugged. “I took you at your word.”', '“Nate, will you just say it?”', '“You have a granddaughter, Susannah.”', 'She replayed these words in her head, once, twice. They didn’t make sense.', '“DNA tests make it certain,” he explained. “She was born six months after her father’s death.”', '“', '.” Susannah did not dare believe it. It was too dangerous to believe. “They both died. That was confirmed by the survivors. They posted the IDs of all the dead.”', '“Your daughter-in-law lived long enough to give birth.”', 'Susannah’s chest squeezed tight. “I don’t understand. Are you saying the child is still alive?”', '“Yes.”', 'Anger rose hot, up out of the past. “And how long have you known? How long have you kept this from me?”', '“Two months. I’m sorry, but . . .”', ' The tombstone. The Martian folly.', 'She stared at the floor, too stunned to be happy, or maybe she’d forgotten how. “You should have told me.”', '“I know.”', '“And I . . . I shouldn’t have walled myself off from the world. I’m sorry.”', '“There’s more,” he said cautiously, as if worried how much more she could take.', '“What else?” she snapped, suddenly sure this was just another game played by the master torturer, to draw the pain out. “Are you going to tell me that my granddaughter is sickly? Dying? Or that she’s a mad woman, perhaps?”', '“No,” he said meekly. “Nothing like that. She’s healthy, and she has a healthy two-year-old daughter.” He got up, put an age-marked hand on the door knob. “I’ve sent you her contact information. If you need an assistant to help you build the habitat, let me know.”', 'He was a friend, and she tried to comfort him. “Nate, I’m sorry. If there was a choice—”', '“There isn’t. That’s the way it’s turned out. You will tear down the obelisk, and this woman, Tory Eastman, will live another year, maybe two. Then the equipment will break and she will die and we won’t be able to rebuild the tower. We’ll pass on, and the rest of the world will follow—”', '“We can’t know that, Nate.

It’s hard to believe he’s eleven. There’s gravy everywhere; practically a gallon of flavorsome beef extract, seasoned with allspice and caramelized onions, a rub of thyme, a bay leaf cooked to gossamer. The new cook spent ages on it. I know. I was there.', '“You’re mean! I’m going to tell my daddy that you said all those things! You’re not supposed to say that.” He howls.', 'I laugh, a little bitterly. There were many things I wasn’t supposed to do, or be. I wasn’t supposed to be someone’s second chance, someone’s happily ever alternate. I wasn’t supposed to be the malevolent stepmother—heartless, soulless, devoid of the natural compassion expected of childbearing women, the instinct to drop everything and coddle needy, whiny little whelps like him.', 'Actually, I suppose I ', ' meant to be all of those things, but I was also expected to rise above the unflattering stereotypes.', 'Well, fuck them.', 'I gesture, a slant of the palm. His attendants, bruise-cheeked and flinching, retreat as one, silent as they pour back through the servant doors. A few hesitate, questions in the bends of their mouths. All these years and I’ve never once asked to be alone with the little prince, have done everything I could to avoid his company.', 'Even if some of them might have been suspicious of my intentions, not one gives voice to their misgivings.', 'At last, the servants are all gone.', '“I ', 'hate you, though,” I murmur, striding deeper into the room, my gown rustling across the marble floor.

When he died, I carved his femurs into the handles of my skinning knives, his tibias into ice picks. A knucklebone, I loaded with iron bearings and then sanded into a gleaming die. We became legends, he and I, but that is a separate story.', '“I hate you,” I continue. “With everything that I am. I hate your screaming. I loathe your lying, screeching ways. I abhor your crocodile tears, your sly little smiles—oh, don’t think that the adults don’t know.

You charmed little prick.”', '“I’m going to tell Daddy,” he announces, venomous. The pupils of his eyes are so wide that they almost eclipse his irises, leaving only the barest halo of gold to encircle the dark. In them, I can see myself: fearsome, fearless, furious. “I’m going to let him know that you said mean things to me. I’ll tell him that I hate you. I’ll tell him to get another mommy for me.

More than anything else, my husband yearned for me to love his son. The little prince was all that remained of the boy’s venerated mother; a pale wraith, sweet if slightly stupid, given to whimsy. She was beloved by the court, I’m told, an overgrown pet whom no one saw reason to censure, charming enough in brief doses. When she died, they mourned for weeks.', '\\nSmall wonder they feared me: the flint-eyed, sharp-mouthed wildling the king brought home from a distant land, mere months after the tender one’s tragic demise—midnight and bone to my noonday predecessor.', 'In the years following, my reputation grew the way my belly refused to do. Rumors spread like brambles, digging thorns in the countryside, sowing myths. My sins were myriad: I poisoned wells; I seduced husbands from their wives, wives from their husbands; I’d birthed the sea monsters that’d devoured one of our northern neighbors; I stole children and made necklaces from their bones before giving them away at midnight balls to demons beyond number; I brought famine, brought plague, trailed locusts and death the way a widow drags her mourning veils.', 'The king paid no heed to those acid whispers.

I am going to scream until he comes in. I am going to tell him you hurt me.”', 'As he intones this, he gropes through the mess. The little prince soon finds what he’s looking for: a sharp triangle of porcelain still dripping with gravy. If I gave a shit about him, I might have stopped him. But I don’t. Instead, I fix him with a lidded stare as he slashes at his own truculent mien, again and again, until he’s bloodied and weeping from every joint. His continued existence is a bonus, not a requirement. His carcass would work just as well.', '“You’re a witch.” He pants gleefully. “I’ll tell them you tried to kill me. And you hurt me.” He barks out a quavering scream. “You made me do things. You made me cry.', '“You know they burn witches,” the little prince continues. “Maybe they’ll burn you. I want to see you ', '.”', 'I sigh and rise. “Keep telling yourself that, little prince.”', 'That last word—', '—shivers through the air, catching in the shadows, like hair snarled in briar.

One winter morning, he shot the creature from its roost on an ice-rimed branch, the slingshot a wrongheaded gift from his father. The squirrel fell, stunned by the rock, a russet blaze against the white. Both the little prince and I trotted to where it’d landed, I to see whether it could be saved, and the boy—', 'He pulped that small head under his boot before I could cry out. It was as good as dead, the little prince informed me, laughing as he dashed away, red footprints across the snow.', '\\nIn retrospect, it seems like such an irreverent little thing to hang a hatred on. Every child, after all, is guilty of some thoughtless savagery, even if this one was more vicious than most, more dangerous. Nonetheless, I learned to despise him that day. Sometimes, I wonder if I should have ended it then, if I should have walked the squirrel’s needle-bones down his throat and through his lungs, let him drown in his own blood. It would have saved a lot of trouble.', '\\xa0', 'The little prince blinks, lapsing to a cunning quiet, animal instinct compelling him to watch, to wait, to be wary. “What did you do?”', '“I spoke to the things you hurt—”', '“I said I was sorry, ” he barks, as though that one word is a confessional to be stuffed full with his sins. As though that one word could absolve everything.', '“—and I told them they had a decision to make. If they could forgive you, if they could bury their rage with them, that would be that. I would ask them nothing else. But if they couldn’t —”', '\\xa0', 'Now the sounds outside have become a thundering of locusts, a murmuration of beetles. Now the shadows lengthen into grasping fingers. I exhale. A moting of green light spools in the air, a hieroglyph from an old and forgotten language.', '“If you kill me, I’ll come back and haunt you.” The little prince makes a hissing sound, scrabbling upright, his petulance morphing to rage. In his hand, the blunted knife he’d been given for dinner, useless for cutting but not, perhaps, for gouging an eye from its socket.', '“No one’s going to kill you, you little brat, and more’s the pity. But you’ll wish you were dead.”', 'At that, he charges, brandishing his knife; no grace at all, no strategy, the weapon clutched like a torch. I sidestep, an easy pivot of the heel, and the little prince staggers past. A howl, high and thin.', '“Oh, you little prick.” I smile in the penumbra of the dusty, green light, all teeth and hate. “You will hurt terribly.”', '\\xa0', 'When he was seven, the little prince sewed up a cat and hid it in a box. When it finally died, he brought the oozing corpse to my library, practically swollen with pride. “Its tummy is full of poo.”', 'When he was eight, he blinded a rabbit with his thumbs, left its skull half-cracked.', 'When he was nine, he bored a hole through a tortoise’s shell and filled it with ants.', 'When he was ten, he learned to be greedy. Every week, there’d be another chambermaid or trembling guardsman rapping at my door, meekly begging for succor, their fear of me subsumed by need. For an entire year, I did nothing but clean up after the little prince’s frivolities. I spent my evenings in the servants’ quarters, exorcising their rooms of his ‘gifts.’ I brewed poultices against nightmares and gifted charms against hauntings, tidied what bones would permit themselves to be put to rest, and made promises to the remainder.', 'The court at large paid no mind to the little prince’s eccentricities, lauding them as portents of glories to come.

Thousands. The little prince was cleverer than I thought, I suppose. More prolific. Perhaps those kills I witnessed were just practice, or things he’d curated for our discoveries.', 'Whatever.', 'The little prince is silent throughout the display, agape with wonder, too stupid to understand that they are coming for him.

Unlike the rest of them, she is whole, preserved by memory or, perhaps, the wailing rage that often suffuses those who have met a violent end. No longer wired to sinew and tendon, she jitters through every stride, a marionette with missing strings; sometimes, she slips. Sometimes, she loses herself, coming apart before some echo of the past draws her back together.', 'She stretches her fingers to him, her phalanges bonded like ropes of white.', 'It is the only warning he gets.', '\\xa0', 'She was just a girl, no older than the little prince, small in every sense of the word. There were scores of children like her, roaming the castle grounds, bastards of the serving wenches; lasting, unwanted souvenirs of a noble’s visit.', 'Another king might have cast them out, but my husband has always been wise. He knew that sometimes there were changes of heart, and sometimes there was a need to pluck an heir from the common people, an heir naive to the rules of power. You could make good money trading in happily-ever-afters.', 'Nonetheless, when the girl disappeared, no one had very much to say. It was a thing that happened, the chancellor explained. Occasionally, the maids would barter a child to the whorehouses, or auction them for a sizable dowry. And the child, until then a hungry mouth with no value, would become worthy of fond remembrance.', 'But the girl, as it turned out, ', ' been sold.', 'She', ' been given away.', 'She—', 'I won’t tell you about what I found. I won’t tell you what I saw when I walked into the kitchen, a sobbing maid curled by the fireplace, the little prince singing rhymes. I will not tell you what he said to me, only that I had to give the maid a sedative before I could lead her from the little girl’s corpse.', 'As for the girl herself—', 'We spoke, naturally, after her bones had been bathed in firefly gut and frangipani. No, I won’t tell you what she said to me, either. But I am not ashamed to say I wept.', '\\xa0', 'Bones do not lie.', 'Even when they are broken and then mended, there are scars to say where a fracture once was. A woman might wear powders to disguise her age and a man might boast of his vigor, but if you know where to look, if you can read their teeth and the bends of their spines, you’ll know the truth each time.', 'And the little prince’s truth is this: He deserves all of it. His bones—pale, pristine—gibber across the floor in rage, incensed to have been ousted from their cloak of flesh. Even now, even in their current state, they are petty, petulant things.', 'I ignore them.', 'Instead, I watch. I watch as those other bones crawl through the red circle of his sagging mouth. I watch as they negotiate placement; which vertebra would go where, which finger would be made by bird wings and which would be put together by human teeth.', 'By tomorrow, they will have cohered into a single entity, a half-thing with dreams of the woods.

And yet, given the level of secret knowledge she now possesses, she is reduced to waiting to reveal her new academic discovery until royal decrees can be lifted and a fraught political situation avoided. In her idle frustration, Isabella vents her spleen upon the shoddy research published by lesser men with swollen heads in local journals. Enjoy the following collection of letters, found in a trunk of mislaid scholarly documents left behind when she removed to Linshire for the season.', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I was fascinated by Mr. Benjamin Talbot’s brief notice, published in the 28 Seminis issue of your magazine, detailing his acquisition of a preserved specimen from a heretofore undocumented draconic species. As we all know, legends of the cockatrice date back many centuries, but I am unaware of any reputable examples collected before now, either dead or alive. This is a thrilling event for the field of dragon naturalism, and I heartily encourage Mr. Talbot to publish his discovery at greater length, including details such as the manner of its acquisition, the island or archipelago in the Broken Sea where such beasts may be found, and a thorough description of its anatomy. An engraving to accompany this article would not go amiss—though naturally a public presentation of his find would be even more desirable. I may dare hope that Mr. Talbot is even now preparing such an article for publication, whether in your magazine or elsewhere, for I have awaited further information with bated breath, and fear I will soon turn blue for lack of oxygen.', '\\xa0', 'I am, as always, your devoted reader,', 'MRS. ISABELLA CAMHERST', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I will beg your leave to respond to Mrs. Camherst through the medium of your pages, for she has addressed me publicly, and as such deserves a public reply, lest I leave your readers in unnecessary suspense.', 'I assure Mrs. Camherst that my cockatrice will be made public in due course. I am making arrangements even now for its display, which will begin on 21 Caloris in Murtick Square, with admission quite reasonably priced. I hope that she understands my reticence in saying more about its place of origin; the appetite for such curiosities is insatiable, and were I to make public the name of the island where this specimen was collected, hunters might flock to its shores, and the population would soon be reduced to a fraction of its current number. Mrs. Camherst having expressed tender sentiment for the well-being of dragons on previous occasions, I trust that her feminine heart will understand my concerns, and not begrudge me this measure of caution.', '\\xa0', 'Your obedient servant,', 'BENJAMIN TALBOT', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I thank Mr. Talbot for his solicitous attention to the well-being of both cockatrices and my feminine heart, but I had hoped for rather more specific an answer. To explain my position: as some of your readers may know, I recently returned to Scirland following extensive travels around the world, including a lengthy sojourn in the Broken Sea. I do not claim to have visited every island in that region (a feat I am not certain any human can honestly say he has achieved), but my ship called at multiple ports in both the Melatan and Puian regions, and in all these places I made no secret of my interest in creatures of even faintly draconic nature. I studied everything from sea-serpents to fire lizards to the so-called komodo “dragons” of Singkarbau (which proved not to be dragons at all)—but nowhere in my travels did anyone say anything to me of a creature resembling the legendary cockatrice. Given the distance between here and the Broken Sea, and the unsuitability of any part of the cockatrice for use in ladies’ fashion, I cannot imagine that hunters would make terribly large inroads on the population there; but there may be scholars who would wish to study them in their natural habitat, and for such individuals the name of the island would be tremendously useful. Elsewise they must search throughout the Broken Sea for this creature, crossing off their list only those islands I myself visited, where I am certain no cockatrices are to be found.', 'Regardless, I look forward to Mr. Talbot’s public presentation of his specimen, which I will be very interested to inspect at the earliest possible opportunity.', '\\xa0', 'Yours in intellectual curiosity,', 'MRS. ISABELLA CAMHERST', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'It was with some dismay that I opened the 29 Floris issue of your magazine to find another letter from Mrs. Camherst gracing its pages. Although her enthusiasm is remarkable, I begin to feel that she is using your publication as a forum for some kind of campaign against me, which might better have been carried out in private correspondence.', 'I am of course aware of the expedition to the Broken Sea last year, led by my esteemed colleague from the Philosophers’ Colloquium, Mr. Thomas Wilker. I do not think, however, that Mrs. Camherst’s role in that expedition qualifies her to offer an authoritative opinion on the full complement of draconic species in the region—a fact she herself admits, though she does not let this hinder her from offering such an opinion, regardless. Indeed, many of the stories we have of her actions during that expedition are anything but scholarly in nature.', 'In light of this, I can understand Mrs. Camherst’s enthusiasm for pursuing the origins of my cockatrice. Were she able to persuade anyone to fund her travels, she might return to the Broken Sea and see the creatures for herself. But I regret to say there is an unfortunate air of grasping ambition about her persistence on this topic, as if she wishes to claim the position of authority regarding this species for herself. Perhaps Mrs. Camherst is unaware of the courtesies practiced among gentlemen and scholars, which dissuade us from “poaching” one another’s discoveries; if so, then I hope this reply will make them clear, and bring this matter to a long-overdue close.', '\\xa0', 'Your obedient servant,', 'BENJAMIN TALBOT, F.P.C.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I pray you forgive me the tone of this letter, which, although addressed to you, is in reply to Mr. Talbot, and is crafted for that audience.', 'I note that Mr. Talbot chose to sign his second reply (printed in the 5 Graminis issue of your magazine) with his credentials as a Fellow of the Philosophers’ Colloquium. Being a lady, I of course have not been admitted to the ranks of that venerable institution—but I like to think that my publications speak for themselves on the question of my scholarly achievements. (I believe the publications that earned Mr. Talbot his fellowship in the Colloquium were on the topic of geology; though of course this does not completely invalidate his observations in the field of dragon naturalism.) As for Mr. Talbot’s comment regarding my actions during the voyage of the ', ', I choose to interpret that as a reference to the events in Keonga; for surely a gentleman of Mr. Talbot’s stature would not slander me by alluding to the scurrilous and unfounded rumours which have circulated regarding my private life and interactions with the men around me.', 'I must, however, correct Mr. Talbot’s misapprehension concerning one of those men. He named Thomas Wilker as the leader of our expedition; you will note my use of the plural pronoun there, which I employ with deliberate precision. The expedition was a joint endeavour between Mr. Wilker and myself, in both its planning and its execution. Any who doubt this matter are invited to submit their doubts to Mr. Wilker himself, who will soon set them straight. (He may even, I dare say, do so politely.)', 'Furthermore, I should like it to be known that I made several attempts to contact Mr. Talbot by more private means but, having received no reply, found myself with no other option but to address him in the pages of your esteemed publication, in the hopes that I might meet with better luck here. If he wishes to avoid public debate in the future, I suggest he inquire into the reliability of his servants, or perhaps of the Falchester postal service, to discover why it is that my letters have apparently not reached his breakfast table. I am certain there can be no other explanation for why my previous queries went unanswered.', 'With these matters out of the way, let me speak bluntly.', 'It seems exceedingly peculiar to me that the cockatrice, which is well-known in Anthiopean legend these past thousand years, should be found on an obscure island in the Broken Sea—quite on the other side of the world. Mr. Talbot has not yet advanced any explanation for how our ancestors of the fifth millennium knew of such a creature, when trade even to the nearer reaches of Eriga or Dajin was uncommon and carried out only with difficulty; nor for why it seems to be unknown in the legends of lands closer to its natural range. Furthermore, while there are branches of the draconic family in which feathers are known—the quetzalcoatl and kukulkan of southern Otholé are of course the most famous, but to them I may add the drakeflies I discovered during my expedition with Mr. Wilker to Bayembe and Mouleen—a cockatrice strikes me as a rather different matter. I know of no true dragon or draconic cousin that exhibits both scales ', ' feathers, and I must say that I find so hybrid a creature unlikely in the extreme.', 'I do not, of course, accuse Mr. Talbot of deception. Rather let us say that I must, with reluctance, consider the possibility that he himself has been deceived; that the man who provided him with his specimen (a man, I will note, who has not yet been identified to the public) was either a charlatan, or himself the gull of one such. The scholarly community has been subjected to hoaxes before, and no doubt will be again.', 'That Mr. Talbot should consider my interest in this matter to be tantamount to poaching is not only insulting, but indicative of a dismayingly proprietary attitude toward scientific knowledge. Our wisdom grows not by staking out claims and defending them against all comers, but by sharing information freely, so that we may work together for the betterment of all. I would gladly cede all credit for the discovery and study of the cockatrice to Mr. Talbot, if only I trusted him to proceed with integrity.', '\\xa0', 'Yours in regret,', 'MRS. ISABELLA CAMHERST', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I will keep my reply brief, as Mrs. Camherst’s vendetta against me has already occupied too much of your publication and the patience of your readers. I take the gravest exception to her accusations against me, and were this the previous century and she a gentlemen, I would not hesitate to call her out. As it stands, I can see no productive end to this debate; and to further engage her would only be to validate her pretensions to scientific authority. This will be the last that you or your readers will hear from me on the matter.', '\\xa0', 'BENJAMIN TALBOT, F.P.C.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Dear Sirs—', 'I was delighted to read last week’s leading article [“A Cock-and-Trice Story,” 30 Caloris—eds.]. I had followed with interest Mrs. Camherst’s debate with Mr. Talbot in previous issues, and so it was gratifying to see the conclusion of that tale featured in your publication. I only regret that the name of the man who sold the specimen to Mr. Talbot is still unknown, as any fellow who can convincingly graft the head of a parrot onto the body of an immature wyvern must be very skilled at taxidermy, and I should like to put such talents to more reputable ends. But I thank Mrs. Camherst for her indefatigable pursuit of the truth, and commend her dedication in disguising herself to attend the opening of Mr. Talbot’s exhibit, despite his very public opposition to her presence. While I am certain that a lady scholar of her stature has no need of financial assistance, I am taking up a collection to reimburse her for the costs incurred by admission to the exhibit and her subsequent arrest, as a measure of public gratitude. Any who wish to contribute may write to me at No. 14 Harwater Street in Falchester.', '\\xa0', 'Your servant,', 'WILLIAM PENBURGH']}\n"

Whatever was in the telegram, he didn’t want to share it, at least not right away. Feeling childish, he watched Jutta lumber closer, her hand on her swelling belly. She smiled at him, and the orange from the fire in the grate caught in her eyes.', '“What does it say?”', 'In the old days, at the end of Soviet times or during the wild Yeltsin years—back when they’d really been doing something, when the art had been the moment itself and not the preserving or capturing or remembering of it—Thomas would have torn open the envelope, tossed it aside. But for this one—the first in years—he fished out his pocketknife, slit the fold, withdrew the folded yellow paper, and laid the envelope carefully atop the Gerhard Richter ', ' monograph on the end-table. Then he opened Vasily’s message, and though Jutta could see the words—English words—as well as he could, he read them aloud:', '“Happening now. STOP. Invitation letter at Consulate. STOP. Hurry. STOP. FISTS.”', '“You know,” said Jutta, “I’m pretty sure they don’t need to say STOP anymore.”', 'Thomas nodded. “Vasily probably just liked using STOP.”', '“And telegrams.”', '“Everything about this.” To his astonishment, Thomas felt tears in his eyes.', 'Jutta was standing right next to him, now, staring down at the note. “They still make us get invitation letters?”', '“It’s still Russia,” Thomas murmured.', '“I guess,” said Jutta, and for a single moment, in her voice, he heard a hint, a suggestion of exactly the feelings he was having. And of course, that was only fair. She had been there, too. Eventually. He looked away, but Jutta’s dusty, strong-fingered hand slid over his. “Thomas,” she said. “Go.”', '“I can’t. The baby.”', '“Is due in three months.”', '“Term. Classes—”', '“Start in two weeks.”', '“This is Vasily. Whatever he’s up to could last longer than that.”', '“Get a cold. Get pneumonia. Your students will live.”', '“I’m not…” he said. Then, “I don’t…”', '“Call the consulate,” said Jutta. “Get Vasily’s invitation letter and your visa. Go.” Turning away, she threw a tiny sliver of soapstone into the fire; ', ', he realized. If not for the baby they’d both assumed they were too old to expect, she’d have dropped everything and gone with him.', 'In truth, for that matter, she’d have gone without him.', '#', 'On impulse, and to save money, he took the train. And because he’d somehow transformed, right as he entered his forties, into a tenure-tracked ', 'who could almost afford it, he took the fast train. He even treated himself to the last second-class bunk in the last available cabin; he was very nearly a father, after all, and long out of practice. He would be of more use to Vasily rested.', 'The first hours passed in a blissful, bleary-eyed blur. In the observation car, he shared ', ' and vodka with a wealthy American couple, both in their sixties, headed to Poland for some sort of pensioners’ opera-singer training camp. Thomas’s spoken English was rusty and his alcohol tolerance significantly diminished, so he wasn’t entirely sure he’d understood his companions correctly. But they laughed easily and offered him saltine crackers from their travel bags once they’d polished off the ', '. Better still, they went silent when the train, slowed by snow, crept into the Lower Oder Valley, and the full moon shot up over the marshlands like a comet streaking over the earth, shedding snow flurries that glittered in the air and on the trees, and silvered the surface of the river.', 'Later, retreating to his bunk, he met his cabinmates, a blond father and his two white-blond, teenaged sons, all smoking and arguing loudly in Finnish. But they quieted without his asking. The whole time Thomas sorted through his hastily packed duffel bag, scrubbed his face with a wet wipe, changed his shirt, and tried to settle on top of the blankets, the Finns stayed silent. When he laid back, one of the sons wordlessly flicked off the light. And so, for a few minutes, wedged into a rut in the hard mattress as if anchored to a cliff face, Thomas imagined he might sleep. Then the party broke out in the corridor.', 'Poles, mostly, he thought, listening to their laughter streaming under the bottom of the cabin door along with their cigarette smoke. Some Czechs or Slovaks, too. Kids, mostly. When Thomas sat up, he was surprised to see his cabinmates in their bunks, all of them sleeping or at least motionless.', ' he wondered. And then, ', 'want ', 'Suddenly, he was out of his berth and back in his sneakers. As quietly as he could—silly, really, given the racket from outside—he edged open the door and stepped into the hall.', 'Almost immediately, the gaggle of students edged away down the corridor, taking up spots at the next windows down, throwing those open to the cold, the whipping wind. They laughed as clouds of snow whirled into the train, exploding against the walls like birds smacking into glass. Smoking and shouting and drinking and laughing, the students ignored Thomas completely.', 'It was absurd, of course, to expect any different, except that Thomas ', '. After all, he’d seen so much that they hadn’t, done so much that they hadn’t: won a yearlong study fellowship to St. Petersburg State, then, with Vasily’s help, almost immediately slipped his minders (mostly, admittedly, because why would they have bothered minding him much?) and joined Vasily’s crew of expats and expelled students and poseurs and rabble. For nearly a year, they’d wallpapered windowless squatters’ digs with daisies in abandoned St. Petersburg buildings and left them for no one to find; put on silent concerts, lip-synching and gyrating, in the middle of parks in the middle of the night; rowed a convoy of johnboats festooned with homemade Big Mac wrappers down the Volkhov, under the pedestrian bridge into the thousand-year-old heart of the Novgorod Kremlin, and then set the boats on fire as the waiting ', ' closed around and finally arrested them; back home in Germany, he had ripped whole concrete chunks out of the Wall with his bare, bleeding hands and danced to “Afterlife” atop it on the very night it fell, then fled police and soldiers from both Germanys into the alleys of the West, which had seemed, to his terrified surprise, so much darker and more frightening than those in the Berlin he’d grown up knowing.', 'Somehow, because he really had done those things (though in another life), he’d expected these kids on this train to welcome him into their conversation, and never mind his not-so-cheap sneakers, his dry-cleaned slacks, and neat, salt-and-pepper professor’s beard.', ', he thought, not without satisfaction. He looked at the brunette girl closest in the corridor, shivering in shirtsleeves against the open window, beautiful with her cigarette clutched against her lips. She turned toward him, and he saw what was on her shirt.', 'For a single, ludicrous moment, Thomas was angry. A Plastic People of the Universe ', ', with a fist and flowers, and the words CHARTA 77 stenciled in rainbow letters underneath.', ', Thomas wanted to shout at her. ', '. Those savage, magical nights in the crypts of Leipzig churches with AuSSchlag and some stolen guitars and rotten beer, or, during his St. Petersburg year, with Zoopark and a single overloaded, half-blown amp in one of the crumbling buildings Putin had now “saved”—rescuing it from ruin and squalor and the free and dreaming young—with the authorities always coming, with vodka bubbling in their bloodstreams as though from an oil vein they’d tapped themselves, he and Jutta (who had won the same fellowship he had) and Vasily’s crew and some fugitives from the Baltics hurling themselves together, flinging their voices out broken windows to be spirited off down the Prospekts into the Neva All his friends from then scattered or gone now, that whole world reduced to slogans and images, useful only for silk-screening onto oblivious young people’s T-shirts.', 'Then, even more ludicrously, Thomas wanted to ask where he could order such a shirt.', 'Turning away, he let himself laugh at himself. And that felt good, only right. It’s what they were always in danger of forgetting, had always had to remind each other about, constantly: how funny it all was. How much fun.', 'He moved a little ways down the corridor toward a window he could have to himself. He was still standing there hours later, staring out at the glass towers, the already-jammed roads around the half-constructed S8 as the train glided into Warsaw through the early morning gray. Everything out there looked so clean even in the sleety overcast of the morning: the squares, the rails sparkling with winter wet, the bundled-up commuters with their briefcases and ear buds. Nothing like the Poland he’d heard such grim tales of in his youth, from the few Poles he’d known then. Warsaw was just another anywhere now, even its formidable ghosts roped off, penned in their carefully preserved ghetto habitats, exactly as threatening and sad as snow leopards at a zoo.', ', he wondered, ', 'Later, to his surprise, Thomas actually managed to sleep. He awoke to an empty cabin and, from the bustle in the corridor, understood that the train was already arriving at Vitebsk Station. He shrugged hurriedly into his coat, stuffed last night’s shirt into his bag, sucked at the thin, nicotine-tinged film of sleep on his teeth, remembered that taste, and realized abruptly that he was there.', 'Instantly, his gloom lifted like something he’d dreamed (', 'the reality, ', 'his world, where he most belonged). Stumbling over his untied shoes in his excitement, Thomas exited the cabin, worked through the clumps of sleepy travelers, showed his invitation letter and hastily arranged tourist visa to a glazed-eyed customs official who barely even glanced at them, and ducked across the platform to emerge at last into the Vitebsk main hall. For a while, he just stood on those palatial stairs, staring up into the domed iron ceiling, his hand on the chipped marble of the banister, listening to the snarl of this least Russian of Russian cities sweeping across the grand checkerboard tile to greet him.', 'Though he’d packed little, he decided to check his bag into luggage storage until he had some idea where he might be staying. Then he realized he was starving, and wondered where the closest place might be to find a slab of ', 'and some black coffee. Descending the stairs, he kept accidentally bumping into people who bumped him in return, glowering as he grinned back. The wind whistling in the open front doors was freezing, somehow white even when it wasn’t visible, laced with ice. Head down, hurrying, now, Thomas pushed out onto Zagorodny Prospekt and threw his arms wide to the winter. He lifted his watering eyes into the wind, turned for the metro, which was right where he’d remembered it, and saw the bear.', 'He froze, held still. The muscles in his back cleaved to his spine, yanking hard, as though someone was running a flag up him. He waited for the bear to lurch to its feet, for his own lips to unlock themselves, let him shout.', 'But the bear…', 'It was less than twenty feet away, not leashed as far as Thomas could see, not attached to anything or anyone, but aligned in the exact center of the parking space closest to the building. ', 'in the center, perfectly between the lines, as though it had been parked there. It had its huge, shaggy head on its paws, its legs folded beneath it, and it was watching people and cars go by with enormous brown eyes, muzzle down, mouth invisible. Snow settled on its fur and accumulated, and no one seemed even to glance at it. Thomas thought he might be looking at a lifelike statue, something animatronic, even, until the bear shuddered, shook the snow off its thick coat, and settled again.', 'A bear.', 'Other than Thomas, the only people paying even the slightest attention seemed to be children who tugged at their parents’ hands, pointed with their mittens. The parents barely bothered glancing around. One man stopped in front of Thomas to snap a picture with his phone before darting back inside the station.', 'Only then, exhausted and starving, did Thomas come to the full realization that he had no idea where to go. He had nowhere to stay, no one to call. No one to yell “', '” to. In the wild Yeltsin years, when Vasily had somehow cajoled his shady new friends into forging Thomas travel documents and luring him back, he’d always somehow arrived with an address or a name, or else he’d come with somebody. Or maybe he’d just ', ' somehow: which abandoned building, which warehouse-turned-improvised-workspace/gallery, which bridge over which canal.', 'And now he thought maybe he did know where to start, after all: the place they’d always come back to, sooner or later, no matter how many times they’d gotten rousted or arrested there.', 'Yes. He knew where to begin, assuming it was even there anymore: Malevichskaya, where it really had seemed, for those few brutal, brilliant years right before and after the Wall fell, that the world—or ', 'world, anyway—was being born. Reborn.', 'If nothing else, Thomas still knew roughly where that was. To reorient himself, he set off toward the canal, burrowing through wind that was even colder than the wind he remembered. He marveled at the icicles dangling like pendants from parking signs and awnings, but even more at the crowds of bundled-up Russians bustling about their business. At a buzzing, Starbucks-colored café, Thomas gave up hunting ', 'and settled for a western-style latte and a dry scone. He sat at a tiny table by the window for a while, watching snow swirl over and around everything, as though the whole Earth had been given a long, hard shake. He watched the Russians passing. The Russian ', 'passing. He remembered the joke—which was really a truism—they’d all used to pass around, when members of Vasily’s loose collective poured into St. Petersburg from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Estonia and Germany and the Ukraine and Lithuania and Hungary:', 'How do you tell the real Russians? Look for the cheapest clothes.', 'Not anymore. Thomas felt more like a spectator at a Paris runway show (albeit an icy one): woman after woman with hair flowing long under elegant fur and faux-fur coats and hats, gliding over the ice in thigh-high black boots with six-inch heels like winter gazelles. It was disorienting, also mesmerizing. He was about to get up when, right in front of the window, one of those miraculous women slipped, banged hard against the glass before him, caught herself, and pushed upright. He caught a glimpse of red cheek, bright blue eye under an oil gush of black hair. Then the woman gazed straight into the window, straightened her coat, saw him staring back…and smiled.', 'This beautiful young Russian woman, striding through her city, and it was clearly ', 'city now. And she was laughing at herself, smiling at him.', 'A magical, almost unimaginable moment, Thomas thought, something that would never have happened in the nervous, battered St. Petersburg he’d known. Yet again, he wondered why he’d come, what he was doing there, how anything he could offer, even as a spectator, could possibly matter now, in the world as it had become, which bore so little resemblance either to the one he remembered or the one they’d all convinced themselves they’d been creating.', 'He was standing now, half-thinking he might catch this woman before she left, actually speak to her, just to be speaking to someone. He’d lifted his hand to try to catch her attention when the bear reared up behind her.', 'The woman didn’t see it, not at first, and she didn’t see Thomas grab the table, reach out to hammer a warning on the glass, and then think better of that. ', ', Thomas thought, heart thundering, then realized that was ridiculous.', 'It wasn’t even the same bear; at least, he didn’t think so. This one was blacker, also bigger, or maybe that was just how it looked up on two legs, towering over the sidewalk, swaying, ribs protruding through its patchy fur, almost more stray cat than bear except for its size.', 'And behind it—all around it—the Russians, in their heels and hoods, with their briefcases and smartphones, just kept walking, funneled around the bear and the woman and never even looked up.', 'Again, Thomas reached to bang the glass, and again he didn’t, for fear of scaring the bear or making it angry. He watched its head sink, noted the look in its eyes—not vacant, just…not ', '…and then it reached out one spike-clawed paw and touched the woman’s shoulder.', 'With a gasp Thomas saw rather than heard, the woman startled, whipped around, shrank back. And then, instead of cowering, dropping into a ball at the bear’s feet, or screaming for help, she spun on her spiked heel and hurried away, folding herself fast into the crowd. In seconds, she was gone.', 'And the bear, dropping to all fours, loped after her, or at least in the general direction she’d gone.', 'Not even bothering to button his own coat, pulling on his gloves as he moved, Thomas exited the coffee shop into the brilliant white light, the white wind, this impossible St. Petersburg of fairy tale women shadowed by bears. His next idea seemed to drop on him out of the whitening sky: ', '? He didn’t ask; he just acted. It seemed, to what was left of his old instincts, the thing to do. ', ', he was thinking. Remembering. ', 'The bear was already a full block ahead, only intermittently visible and mostly as a bubble in the crowd, a floating space the pedestrians avoided. Thomas hurried after it, trying to get closer, but for all its lumbering, the bear moved quickly, and the crowds slowly. At street corners, it paused on all fours at the edge of the curb with its paws in the slush, as though waiting for the light. But then it would just stagger out into the street, and cars would honk, stop in a spray of muck, and wait. And no one—not the drivers, not the pedestrians surging around it—seemed even to look. Or rather they looked, but blankly, as though the bear were a newspaper box or a fire hydrant, something that had always been there. Something not to trip over.', 'At the corner of Nevsky Prospekt, the bear lurched into a stumbling gallop, caught up to a bus, and boarded as the doors closed. The bus rumbled away over the canal toward the city center. And for a shivering moment, Thomas just stood, watching the traffic, feeling as alone as he’d ever remembered feeling, almost bereft, practically in tears.', ' he wondered again. He realized he needed to call Jutta, knew that wouldn’t help right thisatis second, and left his phone in his pocket.', 'It was too cold just to stand, though, too cold even to be out here much longer. He’d had only one other idea about where to go, and he didn’t know what he would find or whether there would be any open doors waiting for him when he got to Malevichskaya. Assuming he could still find it.', 'He found it easily enough. As it turned out, there were signs.', '. And not just signs, but banners strung like flags from the sides of buildings, catching and flapping in the never-ending wind. Mostly, the banners featured scrawled graffiti, black and white, the words in German, Swedish, ', ', for God’s sake. ', ', and ', ' and ', ', and when Thomas saw that, he felt an absurd surge of pride. The words were in English. But they’d been brought there by a German artist, for one of the first “exhibits” officially allowed at Malevichskaya. And they stood out—rang out—still.', 'It was the red Russian words underneath, though, printed in large, almost Stalinesque block lettering, that rattled Thomas most, so much, in fact, that he had trouble recognizing them at first. He parsed them out slowly.', 'Non-Conformist. Art. Center', 'It was a relief, strangely, to turn off Nevsky and immediately find the crowds thinning, then vanishing altogether. The buildings seemed to gray with each passing block, almost to shudder back in time to a darker, lonelier, more familiar Russia. What windows there were had drawn curtains in them. The banners advertising the Center and the exhibit on current display there disappeared as Thomas approached the Center itself. He wondered if there would be more signs out front, carpeting, perhaps a few of those craggy, hunched Russian women the state had always planted inside and at the doors of every museum he’d ever been to in this country, to glower at attendees, daring anyone who crossed their path to ask a question, disturb the silence.', 'To his relief, he found none of those things. In fact, he somehow walked right past the shadowed, brick breezeway that led off the street and through to the old courtyard of condemned buildings. He only realized his mistake half a block later and had to double back. At the mouth of the breezeway, he stopped once more. He looked, and he listened.', 'There was more flapping in there, though whether of banners, clotheslines, whirling bits of refuse, birds, Thomas had no idea. There was one sure way to find out, and he really did have nowhere else to go, no other signal he could send to alert anyone he’d once known that he had come as instructed.', 'He moved into the breezeway, which swallowed the winter light. There were shadows aplenty in there, the wind whining as it sluiced through, stinking like sewage in a pipe. Thomas heard more flapping but no voices. Head down, he burrowed forward, wanting out of the dark, back in the light, and then he was indeed out, standing at the mouth of his old courtyard, staring up at that beautifully maintained bust of Lennon—John, of course—over the crumbling stone archway. Введите в любви, he read, the lettering and the arch of the words perfect mimics of the Arbeit Macht Frei over the gates of Auschwitz. Vasily’s idea, from decades ago. Thomas had never liked it. Vasily had assured him that was the point. Or, one possible point. Thomas could still see him posing underneath, dark eyes glittering with mischief, close-lipped smile splitting his beard like a fault line, hand in the air with a paint brush poised in his fingers like a baton.', '“But ', ' words,” Thomas had protested, just the once. Meaning ', ' “Surely, those are nothing to laugh at.”“What else could one possibly do with them?” Vasily had answered, his grin furrowing even farther than usual up his cheeks, as though he were splitting in half right there in the courtyard. Twenty-five years and both of their countries ago.', 'Thomas opened his mouth to call out now but caught himself. New Russia, Putin’s Russia, Center for Non-Conformist Art this all might be. But it was still Russia. He could feel it. Reaching up, brushing the bottom of Lennon’s chin with his fingers as he passed, he slipped through the archway.', 'Wherever the new Center was, Thomas couldn’t see it, and there weren’t any more signs. The courtyard looked almost precisely as he remembered: two conjoined, condemned buildings where all of their studios had been, sagging into themselves like old loaves of bread, their cracked windows tilting together, the cobblestone chipped and worn underfoot, all the doors shut, daring anyone who’d come to knock.', 'Except that in his time—at least, in the times when anyone living and working here wasn’t being arrested or hiding from being arrested—anyone who ', ' knock got invited in immediately, got a tour and ', ' and whatever cheap vodka was handy. Got to sit and play music, if they played any, or sing along to some if they didn’t. Got to stick on clown noses and fuck drunkenly in stairwells, go off on gallivants to free-climb the sides of abandoned buildings when no one was looking, set paper boats festooned with flags or little origami figures of Gorbachev and Gromyko in kimonos drifting down the Neva toward whoever might be stirred or startled or offended or amused by them.', 'Today, though, his knocks brought only more silence. More flapping, which mostly came from the single, tattered banner strung like drying laundry from one of the high, leaning windows. FREEDOM IS SPACE FOR THE SPIRIT', ', he thought. For himself more than for her, he really needed to call Jutta. He did want to talk to her, let her put the phone to her belly so he could whisper to their unborn child. Tell the child where he was.', 'But he just couldn’t. Not yet, not here. Not in the empty echoes of this Center of nothing, which had been his Center once.', 'The place wasn’t just empty, he realized. It was abandoned. Thomas took in the blank, cracked windows, the black space behind them, the warped wooden doors shut tight, artful paint spattered down them like decorative bloodstains, all of it motionless and meaningless as a diorama in a museum. Which is precisely what this was.', 'For sentiment’s sake only, Thomas wandered a bit, shivering as the wind whistled over him, catching snow on his tongue and in his ears. He only went up the leaning, wooden staircase at the back left because his and Vasily’s room had been up there once, and he only went to the door at the end, which hadn’t been their door, because he could see something stuck to it, flapping almost silently, uselessly, like a clipped wing.', 'A poster, he thought at first, but there was more than one sheet of paper, a little packet clipped together and stuck to the door with a single strip of blue masking tape across the top.', 'An eviction notice, perhaps? Good God, a ', ' of an eviction notice?', 'Absently, he reached out, tugged the papers from the door, and turned them over. Then he just stood in the shadows of the overhang, shivering and staring.', 'FROM WHERE, he read, in English, a smudged, reduced copy of the front page of one of those odd St. Petersburg newspapers published by and for some loose-knit or imaginary community of expats. FOR WHOM, OR WHAT?', 'Underneath the headline was a grainy photograph of a bear actually splayed on a bench, right in the middle of the Field of Mars, its head turned idly away from the camera toward the people passing on the paths, not a single one of them looking back in its direction. In the corner of the photograph, tiny but unmistakable thanks to the red ink in which it had been written, was the word FISTS', 'Which wasn’t a word, of course, but an acronym, Thomas realized. Freedom is Space for the Spirit.', 'And that meant that this had been left here for him. By Vasily.', 'Maybe.', 'Turning the papers into the light, Thomas read fast, then faster. Then he went back to the beginning and started again.', 'None can even say when we first saw them. One day, they were just among us, as though they always had been, and now they always are. They’re on our buses, our metro cars. We glimpse their reflections in mirrors, out windows, as we sip our Arabian coffees in insulated paper cups and eye ourselves in our sleek new Italian shoes. They shamble from alleys and wander in and out of churches and the museums we have at last been granted access to, like creatures escaped from a Levitan landscape, bringing the mood of those landscapes with them. They prowl the canals and the garbage-strewn, teeming alleys around Sennaya Square at evening, bumping against harried shoppers haggling over apples, trailing bits of discarded ribbon or cloth in their claws or on the pads of their feet. Silent, hulking, aimless, they drift among us, not just toothless but mouthless…', '\\xa0', 'At that, Thomas startled, glanced at the grainy photo, but he couldn’t quite make out the bear’s face. He thought furiously back, remembering the creature he’d seen in the parking space outside Vitebsk, and the second one brushing and sniffing at the smiling woman’s shoulder outside the coffee shop.', 'He didn’t know, hadn’t noticed. Surely, if that were true, he would have seen.', 'With an increasing sense of urgency, even alarm (though why, really, should he be alarmed?) he scanned the rest of the article. It revealed little. The bears had appeared only in St. Petersburg, as far as the writer knew, and only a few weeks before. There had been momentary panic, a few clumsy ', ' attempts at “roundups” that, according to the article, had felt and looked more like arrests than animal control. Almost immediately, following a brief and embarrassing episode with Tasers, captured by dozens of citizens on their sleek, new cell phones, the roundups had stopped. A ', 'official had given a brief press conference and said his force had limited resources and would be devoting them to “more pressing and concrete threats such as Chechen guerillas and homosexuals.” And from then on, the bears had been left to wander. They’d simply become part of the cityscape. An advertising gimmick, some guessed, though no one knew for what. A practical joke, but on whom, by whom?', '“A work of art?” the article’s author postulated.', 'The Great Bear of Russia gone toothless and old, or wild and free, or gentle and loving to its own people at last? The shambling emblems of a Russia that even Russians have long since ceased to dream?”', ', Thomas thought.', 'The copy of the article was smudged, the lettering along the bottom virtually unreadable except for the journalist’s name—Yelena Alyakina—and the name of the paper. That was enough. Thomas would start there.', 'Folding the packet into his coat pocket and leaving his freezing hands there, Thomas hurried down the steps, across the empty courtyard, through the breezeway, and back out toward Nevsky Prospekt. At an internet café, he paid for fifteen minutes of computer time, located the newspaper office (which was annoyingly far, well out of the city center, but reachable by metro and a long, cold walk), and set off immediately again into the flurries.', 'The farther he got from the canals, from the banners on lampposts and the glittering displays in frosted shop windows, the more the streets started to look like the streets he remembered: faceless buildings hulking and gray, though even those looked different now, had most of their windows, for starters; the downturned, inward-aimed faces of passersby huddled into their tatty scarves and old galoshes, none of them catching one another’s eyes or stopping at windows to gaze at reflections or flash smiles at lonely strangers. Every ten blocks or so came one of those giant, glitzy chrome-and-neon post-Communist neighborhood centers that had sprung up all over what had once been the East when it was East no longer, complete with market, pool hall, district office, electronics stands.', 'Too long, while the wind worried and nipped at his insufficient coat and his thin Berlin gloves, Thomas walked, trying to leap the dirty slush pooling at every crumbling curb without bumping anyone, ducking back against buildings as Hungarian-built, Soviet-era buses lumbered past, spewing diesel fumes into the air to mix with the snow. Wheezing like bears, Thomas thought. Then he thought of Vasily, wondered where he was. And he remembered something, or almost did. Whatever it was made him feel even more lost. Also, it made him nervous, in a way he couldn’t even begin to name.', 'he thought. ', 'The newspaper office was housed in a single linoleum-tiled room on the ground floor of a particularly faceless neighborhood center, divided from a post office by a crumpled, folding plastic screen. The heat in the building apparently wasn’t working, despite the occasional clanking of pipes in the walls and overhead. Every time anyone in the winding, endless postal line—something else that clearly ', 'changed since Soviet times—or behind one of the scattered newspaper desks spoke, more breath streamed into the air, the clouds of it floating up toward the ceiling, muffling sound and making the whole room feel like the lounge of some nineteenth-century opium den. At a black wooden desk at the front of the newspaper office, a gray-haired woman with her forehead in her hand nodded into a telephone, occasionally growled terse responses in Russian, and didn’t so much as look up when Thomas approached. He’d been standing there a good three minutes before she stuck a finger in the air that he assumed was for him and read as a signal to wait. He looked around for a chair or a bench, found none, felt instinctively that he should step back, give the woman space. But in his head were bears, and the dead, shadowed stairwells at Malevichskaya, and the packet of paper in his pocket. He stayed where he was.', 'After another ten minutes, when the woman still hadn’t so much as made eye contact, Thomas decided he should just stroll past her. He had never liked this about Russians, new or old: the way they dared you to challenge, would despise you if you did, would ignore you if you didn’t. He glanced out the window at the sprawling, empty lot across the street, strewn with paper cups, piles of discarded wooden planks, broken glass. ', 'was the St. Petersburg he had known. Towering over it all was a billboard with fresh, red Cyrillic lettering, the letters dripping as though still wet, though they weren’t, not with anything but sleet.', 'Slowly, Thomas parsed out the unfamiliar word. Then, startled, he glanced at the desk and was surprised to see the gray-haired woman openly watching him. Her eyes behind the glasses were that impossible, transparent blue he’d only ever seen in Russian women’s faces. Lake Baikal blue, he’d always told himself, though he’d never actually been to Lake Baikal, and anyway had no idea where people with eyes that color came from. How beautiful, he thought, this person must once have been. Still was, for anyone she allowed to see her face.', 'She was holding the phone away from her ear and gazing openly at him. Better, and more unlikely, still, she was…not exactly ', '; that would be overstating. But for a Russian far from St. Petersburg’s bustling, cosmopolitan, tourist-swarmed heart, trapped behind a desk across a room from a post office, she was coming dangerously close.', 'Thomas gestured out the window at the empty lot. In his clumsy Russian, he asked, “Does that really say…', '?”', 'Then the woman just up and did it, grinned outright. “Welcome to the New Russia.”', 'Grinning back, Thomas unfolded the copy of the article from his coat pocket and held it out, pointing at the writer’s name. “I want to see—”', 'But the woman was up, shoving her chair from the desk, walking away with the grin expunged from her face. She moved straight to the back of the room, hissed furiously at the little bald man back there behind the tumbling, collapsing stacks of paper on the room’s largest (though by no means newest) desk. The man stood, nodding. The top of his head barely reached the woman’s shoulders. He nodded again, patted the woman’s hand, knocked back the vodka in the well-used glass atop the nearest stack of papers, and moved toward Thomas. The woman stayed at the back, arms folded, watching through those glacial blue eyes that had been watching, Thomas thought, for a thousand years. Oh, yes, he knew that look. That mix of outrage, annoyance, and nervousness verging on terror. He’d known it all his life, though it had been years, now, since he’d last seen it.', '“', ',” said the bald man. He didn’t offer Thomas a hand, and indeed didn’t even stop at the woman’s desk. Instead, he stepped toward the front door, then through it onto the sidewalk. He hadn’t brought a coat, and he didn’t stop for one. Thomas followed him out.', 'The moment the door closed and they had taken up positions under the inadequate overhang, the bald man whirled on Thomas, an accusatory finger punctuating his words. “You’ve upset Larisa.”', ', Thomas thought. Meaning ', '. He couldn’t remember why or how he knew that. Probably because he’d known several Larisas once. Then. Even one or two cheerful ones.', 'Casting about, Thomas tried to call up the Russian for ', ' but couldn’t. ', 'there Russian for ', '?', '“I apologize,” he tried instead.', 'To his surprise, the bald man switched instantly into perfect German. “You just walk in here, waving that?” His finger stabbed at the unfolded papers Thomas still held. “What do you want with Yelena Alyakina?”', 'Thomas blinked, took a breath. “Want? I wish to… I just want to speak to her. About this article.”', '“Why would you be interested in that?”', 'Abruptly, Thomas was annoyed. Or maybe that was his alarm increasing. “Weren’t you? Or were these published by mistake?”', '“Who are you?”', '“What?”', '“Who ', 'you?” The man actually poked him, hard, right under the scarf along the collarbone.', 'Even after all these years in the West, Thomas instinctively recoiled at that question. And because he did, he thought he understood this newspaper’s man reaction after all. This was caution, plain and simple, instinctive and learned the hard way.', 'Wind whistled through him as though he wasn’t even there, was a dead tree sprouting from the cracking sidewalk.', 'He was nothing here. ', '.', 'Thomas almost walked away. What he really wanted to do was call Jutta, catch the next train home. But the bald man was staring at the unfolded papers in Thomas’s hands. And now he mostly looked sad. Maybe.', '“I’m…” Thomas started, and realized he didn’t even know how to explain. “I was once… I am looking for them. For Vasily Litvinov—you know him?—and his… I’m just trying to find my friends.” In frustration, Thomas rubbed at his frozen cheeks and forehead with his gloved hand. The skin of the glove felt even colder than his own. “I wondered only if I could speak to…” He held up the paper, pointing out the name of the journalist once more.', 'All at once, the bald man burst out laughing. He folded his arms across his substantial chest, perhaps just against the cold. When he spoke, his voice was gentle and perhaps a little proud. “That would be difficult,” he said.', '“Sorry?”', '“I can not help you. And neither can Yelena Alyakina.” He nodded once more toward the article. “She is gone.”', '“Gone.”', '“I sent her away. For her own safety, you understand. Just in case. If you want to come back next month, perhaps—”', '“No,” said Thomas. “No, I don’t understand. Safety from what?”', '“From what do you think?”', '“But…for this? For bears in the street? Who would be upset about… And anyway, isn’t this the New Russia?”', 'The bald man stopped laughing, kept smiling. But this was a smile Thomas recognized. Every Russian he’d ever met had a version of it. “New Russia. Old Russia. The price is the same for both. I’m sorry. I hope you find your friends.”', 'With that, the editor left him in the street and returned to his office. Thomas watched through the window as he nodded curtly at Larisa and made his way, head down, to his desk.', 'And now, Thomas realized, he had absolutely nothing. Maybe he’d been on the wrong trail all along, and none of this had anything to do with Vasily’s telegram. The telegram itself, he realized, could have been the joke. The art. Maybe the project had been prying one-time friends from their far-away, comfortable, bourgeois lives with a few taps of tired keys and a tossed-in, worn out acronym. A cryptic STOP.', 'Fumbling with frigid fingers, Thomas found his cell phone in his pocket. He would call Jutta, make his way back toward the Winter Palace, perhaps drift once through the Russian Museum, stop at the market outside the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood and be a good capitalist and buy his wife one of the kitschy Stalinist chess sets she sometimes used in her own art. Then he would catch the night train back to Berlin. This time, he’d be so tired, he might even sleep, partying Poles in the corridors or no. He had already turned away in the direction of the bus stop when another hand slid into the pocket he’d just emptied.', 'His reaction was old, instinctive, born in industrial Berlin warehouses in the shadow of the gutted Wall, in the strobing, strafing lights and hash haze and raw hunger of those impossible nights in the winter of 1989, 1991, when the beats blasting off turntables seemed to be—really were—rattling kings off thrones and girders off buildings, when bodies and minds were hurling themselves together, combining, recombining, the people of a dozen collapsing nations smashing themselves together as though thrown into a continent-wide supercollider, charged and aroused, blindly groping and exploring and igniting. Picking each other’s pockets for pennies for food.', 'Slamming his own elbow against his ribs, he trapped the hand in his pocket, heard its owner cry out, whirled hard on her, and used the motion of his body to drive her to a knee in the snow. Then he stared down in surprise and alarm.', '“Ana?” he said.', '“Let me go,” she snarled in Russian, ripped her hand free, and stood up. She was a full foot taller than he remembered, and of course she would be; he’d last seen her when she was perhaps twelve years old, sitting where she most loved sitting, on her Uncle Vasily’s lap, smearing his beard with the paint on her fingers.', 'How had he even recognized her? Because she was still Ana the black-haired and black-eyed, and her face had always stuck with him. She looked like some Native American chief’s daughter, he’d always thought, with only a storybook basis for the thought: her skin a deep tan, hair wild and dark. She glared up at him now with tears in her eyes.', '“Ana, I’m sorry.” He drew her to her feet, but she shoved away from him. “What are you doing here, and—”', '“You have to find him,” she hissed. The knees of her shabby corduroy pants were wet through, and she slapped at them once with her hands.', '“I know,” he said. “I will. That’s why I’ve come. I—”', '“Something’s wrong.”', 'Thomas realized he knew that, too. More than anything, he wanted to lift a hand to Ana’s face, wipe the tears not quite leaking from her lashes. But she wasn’t letting those tears fall, and he knew better.', '“How did you—”', '“Yelena Alyakina.”', '“You know her?”', 'Despite the unshed tears, Ana rolled her eyes. “At your service.”', '“Wait. ', '”', 'Ana was as much spitting as speaking, and Thomas wasn’t sure he was catching it all. Apparently, whenever the paper had a story that the editor felt might endanger the writer, that story got the byline ', '. And then Ms. Alyakina got sent to Turkey for a while.', 'Thomas was still sorting all of that out when he realized Ana had long since stopped explaining and was instead jabbing a finger at his coat.', '“Your pocket. Thomas, now. ', '.”', '“My…” Thomas glanced down at his coat, and the wind whipped snow in his face. Until that moment, there had been sun somewhere overhead, out of sight but there, which was why the world had seemed so white. But now, it was graying as he breathed.', '“I was putting something ', ',” Ana said more slowly, as though ', ' were the child. “Not taking out. After Vasily gave me the story…or, after Alyosha made him—”', '“Alyosha?”', 'Ana stamped a booted foot hard enough to crack the ice atop the sidewalk. “Before they went into hiding. Vasily left that for you. In case you ever came. I don’t think he really thought you’d come.”', '“He didn’t?” Thomas murmured. Then he shook his head. It didn’t matter. “Why not just give it to me?”', 'Ana’s voice came out bitter, mocking, not at all the way he’d ever heard her address or talk about her uncle. “Just following instructions. He thought you’d appreciate the game. He’s seven years old and always has been.” The tears almost escaped this time, but she beat them flat with her lashes. “Also, something is wrong.”', 'In his pocket, Thomas found the crumpled scrap of brown paper Ana had stuffed there. It wasn’t stationery or even from a sketchbook; it had been cut from a bag. On it was a sketch, crude, very much indeed like something drawn by a seven-year-old. ', ', Thomas remembered. ', 'At first, Thomas couldn’t even figure out what the sketch represented. The moment he did, words he’d forgotten he even knew spilled from his mouth, as though Vasily had reached through the paper and nicked him. “Koltooshy Pavlovo,” he said.', '“', '” Ana whispered, and from her whisper, he suspected she felt the same tremor of unease he did. He wondered if she knew why, because he wasn’t at all sure he could explain.', '“I…” In frustration, Thomas shook his head. “How’s your German?”', 'Ana shook her head. “Not enough.”', '“English?”', '“Yes. Okay.”', '“It’s a gorilla,” Thomas said, in English. “He… We were walking there once. In the woods, out by the Pavlov Institute. Someone we knew was holed up out there. Hiding out, I think. We couldn’t find the apartment, and there were many abandoned buildings, or maybe they weren’t actually abandoned, but anyway, we couldn’t find anyone. And in the woods—not even in a clearing, it was just leaning on this hillside, like it had dropped from a plane—was this miserable iron cage. Maybe…” He held up his hands, illustrating the size. “Two meters by three? Maybe? And inside it…” The shiver that had been building under his ribs rippled across his skin, and the wind kicked up and spirited it away, taking a part of him with it. “Inside it, there were two gorillas.”', 'Ana looked as though she might shove him into traffic. She had always been Vasily’s favorite, all of their favorite, really. Their little collective’s mascot. Hers was the ferocious, black-eyed face of the blazing future none of them had actually believed was coming. Not really.', '“The gorillas were pathetic, Ana. You could see ribs. Their hair was falling out. It was like they’d been there, by themselves, for years. Just maybe left out in the woods. Part of some experiment that had been discontinued. Or maybe they’d escaped. That was your uncle’s joke. They’d maneuvered their cage off the back of a truck and tumbled down this incline and come to rest there.”', '“That joke isn’t funny.”', '“Very few of Vasily’s jokes were funny.”', '“Alyosha,” Ana mouthed, or at least, that’s what Thomas thought she mouthed. Certainly, she was tearing up again.', 'Thomas spoke slowly. He felt as if he were edging up to something, peering over the edge of something. “That was the day he told me about the bear ceremony.”', 'Ana jerked, looked up, stumbled half a step back. For a few seconds, she just glared at him.', '“Ana, what—”', '“There’s a bus,” she snarled. “Come ', '!” Grabbing his hand, she did indeed tug him straight out into the road, and then they were splashing across it, ankles-deep in slush as boxy, rusted Russian cars blared at them and drivers screamed obscenities through closed windows. The bus driver, wrapped up tight in a hooded parka, glanced in their direction—Thomas saw him register them—closed the bus doors, and started pulling away from the curb.', 'And Ana darted right into the bus’s path, stopped dead, and aimed that glare of hers straight through the blowing snow and diesel smoke into the bus’s front window.', 'Then, to Thomas’s amazement, the driver laughed. He honked hard and opened the door. Ana pulled Thomas around the side and up the bus steps.', 'Fumbling in his pockets again, Thomas said, “Ana, I don’t have… I don’t even know the correct…”', 'But Ana had already paid. She received two tickets back from the scowling, balaclava-clad ticket woman standing next to the driver and started shouldering through the old men blocking the path toward the back of the bus. Thomas followed. The bus lurched into traffic through a black cloud of its own exhaust, and Ana pulled up short, tipping back against him. He put out an arm to steady her, glanced up, and so came face to face, at last, with a bear.', 'For a long, surreal moment, he just stood there. Bodies bumped wordlessly against him, no more apologetic or even sentient than boats in a marina. No one else turned around, or dove for the front of the bus, or screamed. As far as Thomas could tell, only he and Ana even bothered looking. Everyone else was pointedly looking elsewhere. Anywhere but at the bear.', 'And it really was a bear, not a man in costume. It was up on two legs, well over six feet tall, hunching to fit under the roof. Once, it shook itself, blowing air out its snout. The snout itself was black and wet, the mangy fur falling out in patches, flecked with snow and dirt. What looked like a scrap of tissue was stuck to one twitching ear, as though the creature had nicked itself shaving. Under the snout, it had more patchy fur but no teeth. No ', ', even, where a mouth could have been, which made the face look… ', ' was the only word that popped into Thomas’s mind. Not just bare but stripped. Like a wall scraped of a mural. Like Malevichskaya with no one in it. Like an empty lot, cleared even of rubble.', 'But it was the eyes that he would remember most. They did, occasionally, swing down toward him or brush over him, deep brown and full of feeling, but not any feeling Thomas recognized. At some point, it occurred to him—absurdly, because given the absurdity of the entire situation, why would this matter?—that the time of year was wrong. That whatever was happening had been ill conceived, right from the beginning.', '“Shouldn’t you be sleeping?” he said softly, to the bear, in Russian.', 'Ana was no longer clinging to his arm, though she’d edged back alongside him, as close to clear of the animal as she could get without leaving his side. Thomas could feel her gaze on him, but he ignored it for the moment.', 'The bear’s ears twitched. It gazed back, or maybe just gazed, not as though it understood or would answer if it could. Twenty minutes before the bus reached Koltooshy Pavlovo, at the edge of some sort of military compound ringed with woods, the animal abruptly stirred, dropped to all fours, bumped Thomas and Ana and the old men aside, and lumbered out of the bus. Before Thomas could even see where it went, the bus pulled away.', '“He was gone so long,” Ana murmured, seemingly to herself.', 'Thomas closed his eyes, tried to blink away the animal’s face, to fight down the feeling that he was drifting farther by the second from anywhere he had ever imagined or wanted to be. When he opened his eyes again, he saw woods, snow slanting sideways as it turned to sleet, Russians huddled around benches at exposed bus stops, motionless as crows on wires.', '“Vasily, you mean? Where did he go?”', '“East. Home, he said. Bullshit, as usual, because he’d never even been there. We don’t have relatives there, now, none that anyone I know has ever spoken of. I don’t even know if there are Nivkh—our people—there anymore. But that’s where he went. Way out in the taiga somewhere. For years, Thomas. He’s been gone for ', '. He left no number, no address, no way to reach him. He never wrote. He never called. And I don’t mean just us, either. I’ve run into most of your old, idiot crowd. Yakov. Timofeev. Larisa.”', 'The names chimed in Thomas like bells rung for the dead, even though he had no reason to think any of them had died. They’d just stopped being who they were, same as he had. Grown up, given in, gotten married, gotten tired, gotten sane.', '“How are they?” Thomas asked.', '“Old,” Ana snapped. Once again, she looked as though she wanted to slap him.', '“And Vasily?”', '“Vasily.” If they’d been outside, Thomas was fairly certain she would have spit. “I actually thought we’d never hear from him again. ', ', I wish we hadn’t.”', 'Thomas wondered. If it had, she got control of it immediately.', '“Then, one day…” She balled her gloved fists against her chest. “Not more than three months ago…there he was. Just plunked in one of those new, overpriced cafés near Dom Knigi, with an entire tray of ', 'piled up in front of him that he was devouring by the fistfuls, as if he hadn’t eaten during the whole time he’d been away. As if he’d been in a gulag and just gotten released.', '“Also, already, it was like the old days. Except instead of you and Jutta and Yakov and Timofeev and Larisa, he had a whole new set of…what is the English…acolytes ringed around him, lapping up his every lunatic word.” She glanced up, grabbed Thomas’s eyes with her own. “Sorry. ‘Friends.’”', '“', ' is fine,” Thomas muttered. “', ' is probably right.”', '“Ridiculous people. Bearded students from St. Petersburg State, or bums from the street. A whole new generation of so-called artists.” Her voice dropped so low that Thomas almost missed the last bit. But he heard her all right. ', 'artist,” she said.', ', he thought.', '“They all laughed when he laughed. They nodded along while he rambled and dribbled crumbs all over himself. Same ', 'black beard, probably dyed, now. Same beady little bird eyes.”', 'Again, as the bus shook her against him, Ana looked up at Thomas. In her, though, Thomas saw feelings he ', 'recognize and in fact knew all too well. “Don’t misunderstand, Thomas. Please. I loved Vasily. I loved my uncle. I ', 'him. But he’s a fraud—”', '“Not always.”', '“—and he’s a clown. And he has always considered everyone he ever met as pawns. You understood this, yes?”', '“I…understood that. Yes.” He hadn’t always. Certainly, he had at the end.', '“And when he called to me, that day he reappeared, he didn’t jump up to hug me. He was excited to see me, all right. He was even more excited because he was sitting there with my…with Alyosha. With my friend. He wanted me to see that. So, naturally, I was the last piece he needed.”', '“Yes,” Thomas said, already comprehending. He marveled at Ana’s clarity. She was Vasily’s niece, for sure. “You were the audience.”', '“I was someone to tell.”', 'Yet again, Thomas felt that shudder of apprehension that had plagued him ever since his arrival. Only, now it had intensified. “Okay. So. What did he tell you?”', 'Sucking in her cheeks, she did a pretty fair impersonation of Vasily’s excited, reedy whine. “‘', '’ That’s what he said, and that’s all he would say, and Alyosha wouldn’t say any more either. He just laughed when my uncle did. Three weeks later, I saw my first bear.”', 'In the sleet, the bus had slowed, its single working windshield wiper slapping at the cracked front glass, more like a whapping cat’s tail than a blade. Around him, people seemed to have settled as the clusters of riders thinned, looking down in their laps and eying each other sidelong. Almost no one else on the bus seemed to be speaking.', '“Ana,” Thomas said after a time, partly just to keep from leaping off the bus, from running, though he had no idea where he would go or why he felt so sure he should go there quickly. “You think Vasily has something to do with the bears.”', 'She shrugged. “The night after I saw my first bear—at the market, next to an onion stand—Vasily showed up at my flat. I… He was so drunk, he could hardly even stand. He’d already thrown up all over himself, probably more than once. And he was spouting such nonsense. ', '. ', 'There was something about some military complex. Or zoo. Or laboratory. All those things, actually. ', '’ he kept shouting. ', '’ Then he threw up on my floor, on my new rug, and I threw him out on the street and told him to come back sober. I remember he laughed at that, so I said, ', '.’ And he said, ', '“The next day, Alyosha called and woke me up to say he was going off with V. ', ', he said, as if anyone ever called my uncle that. He said they’d be underground for a while, that he’d call as soon as he was back. And that was the last I heard from either of them.”', ', Thomas thought. ', ' “I don’t understand,” he finally said. “Why would even Vasily want—”', '“We’re here,” Ana said abruptly. “', '” To the driver, she snapped, “', '.”', 'The bus lurched to a stop, eliciting glares from turned-up faces all around them. An old woman in a balaclava barked something at Ana, and she laughed as she tugged Thomas off the bus. Before Thomas had even gotten all the way free, the doors were sighing shut. The bus plowed back into traffic, spraying muck and slush.', '“What did that woman say?” Thomas mumbled, bending to wipe at least some of the sleet off his pants before realizing it was hopeless. He was wet through.', '“She said, ', '’”', 'Still hunched, Thomas glanced up. “You’re kidding.”', '“This is not something I do,” Ana said. If she’d smiled then, he might have gathered her to him, held her, told her it would be all right.', 'Instead, she looked past him down the sidewalk at the pedestrian bridge that angled away from the community center, across a little reservoir into surprisingly dark and tangled woods. “Thomas? I think we should hurry.”', 'Without another word, they started toward the bridge. Sleet swept across them, stitching the air into a grimy gray curtain that rippled with their passing, brushing wetly against them. A very few locals, sticking to the muddy track from the apartment complexes up the hill, scurried by with their heads down. The bridge’s railings were weirdly white wood that looked almost plastic, and on the rippling surface of the little reservoir, a single duck floated, its feathers Soviet-housing-complex brown and mottled. By the time Thomas and Ana reached the trees, water was rilling down their necks into their coats. It felt frigid, and worse, gummy. More like mucus than rain.', 'Under the scant cover of a bare hemlock tree, Ana pulled Thomas to a stop, and they stood for a moment, listening to the forest rattle with the patter. Just visible through the snarled bushes and dead hemlocks ahead, Thomas could already make out the hulking brick buildings of the Pavlov Institute, where the great man himself had made that most Russian of scientific discoveries: that living things are slaves to their patterns, and do what they are conditioned to do.', '“Okay,” Ana said, wringing her hair. “Where?”', 'Shivering, Thomas eyed her. “What?”', '“You brought us here. You said you’d been here with Vasily. This is where he sent you. ', '”', 'She was getting ready to shove or yell at him again. It was almost funny in a terrible sort of way. In a way Vasily would have found funny. “Ana. I have no idea. How would I…” His voice trailed away.', 'He ', ' been here once. But he was fairly certain that except for the Pavlov Institute buildings, which they hadn’t entered, few or none of the other structures around them had even existed then. And the woods had seemed wider and wilder, less like an overgrown yard, more like somewhere gorillas, or bears, might be…', '“This way,” he said abruptly, and stepped back out into the sleet. ', ' He didn’t. But here he was, leaning into the wet, wild wind with his nose in the air like a dog. Like Pavlov’s dog. Vasily’s dog.', 'Shoving aside branches, ignoring the freezing water streaming down his neck into his sweater, he moved left, then forward, past buildings, down a little slope he didn’t exactly remember, but there was something in his brain, a scent, a memory of a sight, something.', '“Thomas?” Ana said, and her voice now was the one she’d had when he’d known her last. When she was a little girl. “The bear ceremony. What did Vasily tell you about the bear ceremony?”', 'Mostly, Thomas was watching the woods, staring into each not-quite clearing, each shadowed wild place in the lee of those brooding, lightless buildings that had been lightless then, too, that he and Vasily had imagined were lightless always but vibrating with sound, not at all unlike their squatters’ studios at Malevichskaya. In fact, they’d imagined these buildings haunted by Pavlov and his dogs, ringing and barking to each other in the dark.', '“I don’t remember, Ana. Nothing, I don’t think. That…bears were important? That your people—”', '“Our ', ',” she snorted.', '“—picked a bear. Every winter, right? And invited guests. Lots of guests, from far away.” ', ', he thought, noting and then suppressing the thought with a shudder.', 'And then he realized that he ', 'sure: whatever was happening here, Vasily had done it. Even the time of year was right, after all. Vasily had told him, years ago: the Nivkh bear ceremony was a winter festival. A feast involving ritual dancing, some sort of teasing of the bear (', '). A celebration.', '“There,” he said suddenly, and stopped ankle-deep in a rutted row of muck plowed some indefinite time before by some sort of multi-wheeled military something.', 'Without waiting for Ana, he plunged off the path, down another surprisingly steep incline, through an accidental—no, ', '—hedge of tall, dead bushes, their thorns brittle, breaking against his coat sleeves like old brick, like chunks from the smashed-in Wall. He burst into a little copse, not so much a clearing as a half-open space under two towering dead hemlocks, like an amphitheater tipped up on its side. In the center of the copse, right where the shadows met the light, propped between half-visible, centuries-old underground roots, sat the gorilla cage.', '“This is ', ',” he whispered, as Ana burst through the hedge and reached him. “We found it.”', 'Together, they stared at the rusting black iron bars of the cage. The door hung open, half off its cracked hinges, as though whatever had been in there really had escaped. The idea thrilled Thomas, somehow: those two bedraggled, shriveled apes loose in these woods, maybe crouched right over their heads on the dead branches. He remembered the gorillas’ eyes, their alien, animal gazes, not so close to human after all, and he shuddered and glanced up. Of course, there was nothing above but empty sky, sleet slanting down.', '“Found ', '?” Ana said, her voice furious, exhausted, disgusted. To Thomas’s alarm, she sank to her haunches, dropping her head into her gloved hands. With her wet, black hair streaming down her back, she looked at once peaceful and wild, crouching there. Like a gorilla, or a bear. She looked up. The wildness in her did not dissipate. “Is that all he told you?”', '“About this?” Thomas said. “About what we’re doing here? He didn’t tell me anything, remember? He drew me a gorilla on a bag and you—”', '“About the bear ceremony. I’m gathering he didn’t tell you the end.”', '“It has an end?”', '“It has…” Ana snatched up some sticks in her fist and snapped them between her fingers. “I hardly remember. These were children’s stories, you understand. Something my ', ' and my ', 'taught us. My parents didn’t even want them talking about it after we moved to Moscow. They had a huge fight about it once. My parents wanted us to be ‘proper Russians.’ I think ', 'actually attended one, one time. She said at the end, they—”', '“Oh, ', '!” came a snarl from up the hill. “Shit, shit, shit. What are the chances?”', 'Half-stumbling, half-plunging down the hill on the other side of the copse came a gray-haired dwarf in a splotchy green overcoat, spectacles in one hand, what looked like—and, indeed, turned out to be—an iPad in the other.', 'He had both arms flung wide for balance, and not until he’d reached Ana and Thomas did his hood slide back so they could see his face.', '“Uncle ', '?” Ana breathed, stood, and started forward.', 'But he was already past her, diving into the gorilla cage, yanking the door shut with a clang, spinning in what seemed six directions at once as he gathered a pencil, a notebook, a stained gray rug, and a bunch of browned bananas out of the mounds of dead leaves on the floor of the cage. Plopping himself on the carpet, Vasily opened his iPad case, pulled free a single banana and half-peeled it, slid the pencil behind his ear and the spectacles onto his face. Only then did he look up.', '“Oh. ', ', Ana. Thomas. You got my messages.” He spoke mostly English, with sprinkles of Russian, then German.', 'Thomas stared at his friend. Even grayed—and he was all the way gray, and also beardless, clean-shaven as a little boy—and even sitting in a gorilla cage in the middle of the woods, Vasily looked only like himself. It was the eyes, Thomas thought, it had always been the eyes: expressive but also unfathomable, mesmerizing. Rasputin without the power-lust. Situationist Rasputin.', '“You were supposed to find me this way,” Vasily said, grinning. “I’ve been sitting out here for days, waiting. And so of course, I get up to use the toilet in that building there and replenish my banana supply, and ', 'when you show up. Come in here! Let me embrace you.”', 'For one ridiculous moment, Thomas didn’t want to enter the cage. Then he started forward, and as he did, Ana bumped him aside, grabbed the bars, and rattled them. “Uncle Vasily, where’s Alyosha?”', 'Just like that, Vasily forgot Thomas was there. Thomas watched it happen. At this moment, Ana was the better audience. Therefore, she was the center of Vasily’s world.', '“Ahh.” He spread his hands, shrugged, and smiled. “How would I know?”', '“He’s not with you? He said he was with you.”', '“He did? When?”', '“Uncle Vasily. Please. Where are they hiding?”', 'Vasily just grinned wider, his mouth like a red rip in the gray day.', 'Ana shook the bars, still more snarling than pleading, but not much more. “Where is Alyosha?” She sank back to her crouch, meeting his gaze at eye-level.', '“Vaska,” Thomas said, stepping up beside Ana but instinctively staying outside the cage, in her world, not his.', 'Mouth full of banana, Vasily ignored them both. Many times, Thomas had seen him like this. Asking direct questions would be pointless, counterproductive. He would only discuss what he wanted to discuss. And what he wanted to discuss was his art.', '“Vaska. This… Your bear ceremony. That’s what this is? You learned it in the East?”', '“Learned it? Well. I ', 'it there. Yes.”', '“From—”', '“From just being in that world, Thomas. Oh, you should have come. You should have seen—you would not believe—how those people still live. In those villages, way out in the taiga, with winter coming in. Half-dark all the time except when it’s completely dark. Snow so deep that it took me weeks, once I got back, to walk right again. It was as if I’d been on a ship and couldn’t get my land legs. Most of them still live in these little, tiny huts with wood stoves, except the ones who live in the one giant Soviet apartment monolith they built for the Party members and oil workers’ families in the middle of the only square in what they call a town. So, what do they do at night, when they’re not working? When no one’s watching?”', 'It took Thomas a moment to realize Vasily actually expected an answer. Ana, he suspected, was close to leaping through the bars to wring her uncle’s neck. On the path above them on the other side of the hedge, people tramped up and down through the muck. The sleet had eased some, softening into ordinary, white St. Petersburg snow.', '“I don’t know, Vasily. What do they do? Play snow football?”', '“Hah. Yes. Sometimes. Also, they have an annual Stalin’s head ice-sculpting contest. That’s quite something to see.”', '“You’re kidding.”', '“The better question is, are ', 'kidding? I was among them for four years. Still have no idea. Wonderful. But mostly, I am sorry to report, what they do at night is watch.”', '“Watch. You mean storms? The ice?”', 'He snorted. “Their cell phones. They have a brand-new tower. They watch a lot of ', '.” Taking another bite of banana, Vasily grinned again. “They…what’s the American phrase…they ', 'watch. They drink. They have drinking games based on plot twists. Very inventive. Very amusing.” His voice dropped to a whisper, and he poked a single index finger up in the air. “And then—only sometimes, and only very late at night, when they’re huddled around their stoves or their radiators, and a brand-new wind comes howling down off the Pole, and they think no one else alive could possibly be watching or listening—do you know what they do, Thomas? They pray.”', '“Pray.”', '“Such prayer, Thomas. Do you remember going to Orthodox masses with me? Just to watch all those people stand in their nooks, their private corners, for hours and hours, while priests chanted and stepped out among them and went back up on their stages or whatever they call them, doing all those incomprehensible, ritualized things? Well, ', 'praying makes that look…” For the first time, Vasily met Thomas’s gaze straight on. There were tears in his eyes. Here was the Vasily Thomas had known, marveling at and even loving the world. Thomas had forgotten he could do this. That this was the very center of his art, of his whole being.', '“', ',” Vasily breathed. “Young. Diluted. What the Orthodox do…what we do, any of us…it’s like the ', 'of prayer. The atavistic ', ' of prayer.”', '“Vaska,” Thomas said. “Tell me about the bear ceremony.”', 'At that, the tears in Vasily’s eyes actually spilled over. His hand rose to his cheek, spread across his stubble-free cheek as though feeling the wall of a cave. As though Vasily had never felt such a cheek before. “Oh, Thomas. The bear ceremony. Such an inadequate name.”', '“', ',” Ana hissed, clutching the bars.', '“I only saw the one,” Vasily said. “But such a one. And afterward…I learned. I ', ', Thomas. I talked to the shamans. They’re all shamans-by-night now, of course. Grocery clerks or oil field worms by day, if you can call what they have up there day. I went to their huts or their flats. I brought them vodka, and vodka, and more vodka. And I listened while they talked. I heard what they knew, all the forgotten things they know. And eventually, when they realized that I was learning, they started teaching me. And I realized, at last, what gift I could bring back to poor, confused, mafia-infested, Starbucks-infected, Putinized, brutalized, baffled, beautiful St. Petersburg: a memory from an even more savage, beautiful time we’ve all forgotten, or denied, or repressed, or dreamed. A kiss—my kiss—to the northernmost city in the world, from the far East they’ve forgotten is even there.”', 'Abruptly, he giggled. “Or it would be a kiss. If not for what happened with the damn mouths. Oh, my poor students. Your poor Alyosha, Ana. I didn’t intend that.”', '“Poor Alyosha?” Ana whispered. Abruptly, she stood. Reared, really. Anyone but Vasily would have lunged for the cage door, smashed it shut, prayed it locked, to keep Ana out. “Where is he?” she said.', 'Only then did Vasily seem actually to register the question. He met her gaze straight on. “You’ve probably seen him more recently than I have.”', 'Understanding dawned so fast in Thomas, and so softly, it was like awakening, or remembering. Ana understood too, he suspected, because she hadn’t lunged, had gone frighteningly quiet. Maybe she’d somehow guessed all along.', 'Ana gave the bars one more feeble rattle, banged her forehead against them. “Uncle Vasily,” she said. “Just say it.”', 'Thomas started to ask how, realized that was always the wrong question, with all art but especially with Vasily’s. Also, what did it matter? It had happened. There were more important questions now: What did it mean? Was it meant to be temporary?', 'Could any of them be saved?', '“Vaska. How long have they…since you did this? Since ', 'ceremony? If you did this…', 'them…and if they have no mouths…”', 'Vasily was up, now, striding back and forth through the leaves, waving the last nub of banana like some fat stub of lecturer’s chalk. “It’s the most wondrous part, really, isn’t it? The best part. Because, Thomas, Ana, ', ' Did I do it wrong? Did I misunderstand the instructions they gave me? Or did they leave something out? This could be ', 'art. Do you understand? ', 'joke. The grocery-clerk shamans of the nowhere-East, conjuring fairy-tale man-bears with no mouths, tricking a madman”—he stopped in mid-babble, whirled, did a little curtsey, and went right back to pacing, waving the banana—“into turning them loose to wander and wonder and slowly starve to death on the streets of the city Russians built to connect them to the world that isn’t Russia. That whole winking world of marvels beyond the Urals, across the Black Sea, that we never have quite made sense or become part of…”', 'Reasoning with him, Thomas knew, was useless. It was also the only possible or sane course. The only chance. “Vasily. These bears. These…', '. ', 'students.”', '“They participated willingly, Thomas. Gleefully. They gave themselves to the moment, as we all learned to do. I told them exactly what was going to happen. Except for the mouths. I didn’t know about the mouths.”', '“And the ending,” Ana said, her voice no longer angry, spilling from her lips in a haze of heavy, white breath. “I am thinking you didn’t mention the ending.”', '“So, you ', 'remember,” Vasily said, practically dancing. “Ana, you probably know more about the Nivkh bear ceremony than I do; your grandparents actually grew up there and—”', '“I remember my ', '’s stories. You monster. ', '. I remember the ending.”', '“The ending?” Thomas asked, and Ana turned to him. Her expression seemed so far away and fragmented, it was as though he were viewing it through a kaleidoscope.', '“Of the bear ceremony,” Ana said flatly. “When the shamans murder and dismember the bear.”', 'Vasily had snatched up his iPad, and now he was staring into it, waving his finger and talking to it like a wizard over a cauldron. “Ooh,” he said. “Look! They’re gathering.”', 'He held up the iPad. On it was displayed what Thomas first took for some sort of game screen, a grid with little dots moving over it. Then—by the blue veins of the canals—he realized he was looking at St. Petersburg, a street map of the city center. And then he understood what the dots were.', '“What…” Ana started, but Thomas waved her to silence.', '“Bears?” he said. He didn’t have to manufacture any of the wonder Vasily expected when his acolytes addressed him. Wonder was certainly one of the things he was feeling. “How did… You’re tracking them?”', '“GPS,” Vasily crowed. “In little pendants around their necks. Like pet tags.” He beamed.', 'Transformed, mouthless man-bears under a shaman’s spell. Their every aimless, hopeless movement tracked via satellite. Old-world magic, new-world magic. New Russia and old. As art, Thomas thought…as Situationist prank…it was…', '“I think maybe you better hurry,” Vasily said to Ana, his voice suddenly soft, almost human. Almost an uncle’s, and with real love in it. “', '. I think perhaps it is ending.”', 'Pounding her fists once more against the cage, Ana whirled and ran. For a single second, Thomas hesitated, thinking there was something he should say to Vasily, do for or maybe to him. But Vasily was just standing amid the leaves, not even looking at Thomas anymore, and suddenly, he seemed so small. Forgotten, older, soon to be old, as empty of purpose or thought or hope—whatever that might be or once have been—as the gorillas they’d once glimpsed here, all those years ago.', 'Spinning away, Thomas stumbled up the incline and after Ana through the flurrying snow.', 'Of course, this being St. Petersburg, not Paris or London or New York or, God knew, Berlin—and the sprawling outskirts of St. Petersburg, at that—it took them almost two hours, by bus and then metro, and then another metro to reach Nevsky Prospekt. By the time they reemerged onto the street, the day had already darkened. Flurries filled the air, winking against the glowing streetlights and the brilliantly lit Winter Palace like migrating snow sprites swarming over the rooftops and street stalls and buses, settling on the drawn-up hoods and scarves of all the people—the dozens, the hundreds of people—surging, seemingly as one, toward the Palace Embankment.', 'Shivering in the cold, Ana grabbed his hand. “Oh, Thomas,” she breathed, the first words she’d uttered other than Russian curses and her Alyosha’s name since they’d left the woods around the Pavlov Institute.', '“Come on,” he said, pulling her along through the crowd.', 'They couldn’t run—there were too many people—but they moved fast, angling sideways, cutting between couples and families, darting around parked cars and between idled buses stranded in the surge of pedestrians. They rode the surge. It felt, Thomas realized, surprisingly like those last days at the Wall. Or rather, those first days of Wall-lessness, with people massing like water at the lip of a crumbling dam, sloshing over it, exploding through it.', 'Except without the joy, somehow. Without the convulsive release.', 'Without the hope, he understood abruptly. Which had probably been imaginary, or at least ephemeral, even then. But it had been there. Whereas this…this was just about seeing now. About being there to see. That was all anyone, East or West, hoped for anymore.', 'The crowd hustled them forward, spilled out onto the Palace Embankment where traffic had stopped dead, the few cars along it seeming to float in the roiling river of people like unmanned gondolas. Still clutching Ana’s hand, Thomas pulled her forward, nudging and bumping bystanders aside, until he somehow found them a spot right up against the stone wall separating the streets from the Neva. Not until Anna was safely ensconced alongside him did he look up. And not until she gasped did he see what she had seen.', 'The bears—all of them, if Vasily’s tracking devices had been working properly, two dozen, at least—were on the bridge. On Troitskiy Most. Some of them were just lying in the center of the traffic lanes, muzzles down. Two had draped themselves over the stone barrier facing the Winter Palace, heads slumped, like pelts hanging themselves out to dry. The rest were staggering aimlessly around up there, thudding into each other, stumbling to their knees and lurching back onto their feet. Occasionally, one turned fully in Thomas’s direction. It was those moments he would never afterward shake from his dreams: those eyes, devoid of everything but life; those blank, mouthless spaces, which should have rendered the faces friendlier, like stuffed things, but instead just made them ridiculous. Paper creatures ripped from some giant’s pop-up book, impossible to put back, impossible to sustain or corral or save. Of no tangible worth to anyone.', 'At either end of the bridge, police had established roadblocks and barriers, and they were making a great show of waving rifles around, though even they seemed confused about where to aim, whether their purpose was to keep people away or bears on the bridge. Around them, almost everyone but Thomas and Ana had cell phones out, and they were snapping photos silently, checking the photos on their screens.', 'For a long moment—Thomas would remember it as barely a breath—the whole city froze, as though posing for a portrait: snow in streetlight, the Neva and the palaces and the Peter and Paul Fortress and the long blue muzzles of the guns glittering in the blue-black dark, and the faces, dark and light and European and Mongolian and old and even older and, very occasionally, young, all massed together, as individual as snowflakes and also as fractal. One face.', 'Then—not slowly—one of the bears draped over the stone barrier reared up, swaying on two feet. As one, all the rifles at either end of the bridge and all the raised cell phones along the embankment swung toward it, locked in. The bear paid no attention, seemed instead to be staring up at the stars, and it was shaking, its whole body shuddering and rippling.', '“It’s roaring,” Ana murmured, her voice seeming to wisp apart as it streamed into the air.', 'And Thomas realized she was right. Not that he’d ever seen this happen before, or ever would again, but there was no question: that, right there, was how a mouthless bear roared. And now, it was doing it harder, positively bellowing its…whatever it was—frustration? Hunger? Desperation? Loneliness?—in absolute silence.', 'Right beside that bear, two more rose up, and there was a thunderous, impressively unified ', ' as a hundred safety catches popped off a hundred rifles. But no one shot, and the silence rippled and resettled with the snow as more bears rose in twos and threes.', 'Then they were all up, swaying, shuddering, heads thrown back, muzzles straight up in the air. For at most five seconds, all of them shuddered and strained together, as though a whole bear-forest had somehow sprouted right in the center of Trinity Bridge.', 'Did one of them slip? Knock into the others? Thomas would never be sure. All he knew with any certainty was what he saw, as Ana clutched his hand, sobbed silently beside him, hung there, leaning into the night over the Neva:', 'The first bear, the one who’d risen, gave a last heaving, soundless bellow. Then—as though it had somehow roared itself out of its skin—its body sagged all the way forward, its legs bumping the stone barrier as it tumbled off the bridge into the air. Before it had even landed, other bears followed, tipping forward one after another like lemmings, plummeting into the river and sending up spumes of icy spray that drove the crowd ducking and shouting backward.', 'But Thomas and Ana stayed where they were, watching bears surface one by one, the water bearing them up, ferrying their broken, motionless bodies down the canals, through the snow-draped night and out of St. Petersburg toward the Gulf of Finland.', 'There should have been…Thomas wasn’t even sure what. A collective wail. A chorus of gasps. A moment of silence, just to mark that something had happened. Was passing. Something living.', 'Then the police whirled on the crowd. Briefly, Thomas panicked, thought they might open fire, worried he could end up trapped—or shot—against this wall in the midst of a riot, a mindless surge.', 'Instead, with astonishing speed, the crowd along the embankment dissolved into its thousand separate parts, its couples and tour groups, its office mates and solitary travelers bumping and cutting behind and in front of one another. This wasn’t a surge, just a separation. And by the time he realized that, got himself steady on his feet, and cleared his head, Ana was gone.', 'Gone. Where?', '“', '” he called, just once, thought he saw her across the street, head down, black hair streaming as she burrowed through the throng. ', ', Thomas thought', 'with a smile so faint that the first movement of his head melted it off his face, ', '.', '“Turkish?” he heard a laughing voice say, in English, right next to him.', 'Surprised, he turned, started to answer, “German,” and realized the man—kid, really, college kid—was talking to the speckle-faced, green-eyed, laughing redhead he was tugging behind him.', 'Food, Thomas realized. They were talking about food.', '“This place is ', ',” the girl said. And then they were gone too. And Thomas was practically ripping his gloves off his hands, pulling out his phone and punching at the speed-dial.', '“Jutta?” he said before she’d even spoken, had barely even answered. “Jutta, it’s me.”', '“Yes, I hear that,” she said. Laughing.', 'His wife, laughing. Thomas almost hung up on her, too, almost threw the phone into the Neva, let it follow the bears. The dead and beautiful bears.', '“And so?” Jutta was saying, her laughing voice filling his ear. “Did you find him? What has he got up to now?”', ', Thomas very nearly answered. ', ' ', '“Can I talk to our son?” he said.', '“Can you…” Jutta started, and Thomas thought she’d actually heard, understood. But of course she hadn’t. She was still laughing. “Here he is.”', 'Of course, Thomas had nothing to say to him, either. Except, in the end, “Hello.” And so, he said that. Then he said it again. And he went on doing that, in his mind, out loud, to his son, all the way back to Vitebsk Station to catch the next train home.', '\\xa0', '“Freedom is Space for the Spirit” copyright © 2016 by Glen Hirshberg', 'Art copyright © 2016 by Greg Ruth']}\n"

The post-apocalyptic wasteland is awash with violence and injustice, and the genrenauts’ own King must step in and show precisely why There Will Always be a Max.', '\\xa0', 'In a world running on fumes, hope is priceless.', 'King opened up the throttle, shifting into higher gear as the Force Runner tore across the broken remnants of what used to be a road. Overhead, the sun beat down on the Kalahari.', 'Used to be, this region was Beta team’s beat. But you pick up a team member from a region, it ends up your problem from then on—it’s just how it is. Part of the payment, the back edge of recruiting from story worlds instead of Earth Prime.', 'King never set out to recruit Roman, but in King’s world, when you came across a broken man at the end of his rope, a man who’d rather walk off into the eternal stretch of featureless sands than let people in, who chose death over community, you did something.', 'Roman swore he’d never come back, not unless there were no other choice.', 'And that put King behind the wheel, with a car full of guns and ammo, tanks of water and hardtack, wearing the beaten leather jacket.', 'It fell to King to step into the legend, to find and address the breach. Since Roman’s departure, breaches broke harder there, the region deprived of a hero. So, instead of inserting himself as a helper, more often than not, King had to carry the story himself. Every mission, he danced the razor’s edge between failure and causing as much damage through gross action as he was addressing.', 'Ahead, the road was bare, sun dropping toward sunset. He’d be able to cover another hundred, hundred fifty miles that day, zigzagging across the Wasteland, looking for signs of life.', 'In this region, breaches didn’t advertise themselves well. You were lucky if you got a reading within a hundred square miles.', 'But there were only so many stories in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Someone comes to town, someone leaves town (usually in a box). Someone takes what you have, you try to get it back (usually with force).', 'Someone needs help, and only one person can help them.', 'The Max.', 'King had first come up with the theory ten years before, cross-training with Mendoza’s team to round out his territory knowledge. A team leader needed to know as many worlds, as many regions as possible. He couldn’t count on his procedural knowledge to cross over into every situation. Time on-world was essential to stay on top of the game.', 'A dark shape moved against an ocean of yellow-orange brightness, popping with the glimmer of sunlight on metal.', 'King pulled on the wheel and went off-road, the car roaring over the water-starved earth. Dust rolled up behind him, signaling his presence to anyone for miles around.', 'Raiders would come soon enough. But good money said he’d find the breach first. That’s how it went. This region ached for stories like it ached for water.', 'He saw the glint again, a mile away, something metallic tucked into rocks, sand dunes on either side. The place was half-buried. But only half.', 'Dots and specks surrounded the building. Wreckage or ruins.', 'The car rumbled over the rough ground. King leaned over and grabbed the shotgun out of its sheath on the passenger’s-side door, wishing for the fiftieth time that this region was anything resembling friendly to groups.', 'But here, a lone rider could do three times as much as a full complement of Genrenauts.', 'A group was competition, rivals for resources.', 'But one man…one man could be a legend, a savior.', 'Coming closer, King started to piece together the story. Smoky wreckage. Bodies. A trio sitting beneath a hastily made lean-to. A trailer half-loaded with machinery of some kind.', 'But no tow truck, no car.', 'They’d been stranded. Probably half-killed by raiders, maybe a few of them stolen away.', 'He hadn’t pegged an enclave anywhere in the area, nothing on his map, so whoever they were, they were far from home, far from help.', 'And that’s when he felt it at the back of his neck, beneath the sweat and the already caked-on dust. It had all the right makings—group down on their luck, away from an Enclave, under imminent threat.', 'This was the breach.', 'A football field away, King let off the throttle and applied the brakes. “Be the story.” His words were invocation and affirmation at once, a tip Roman had passed on for the first time King deployed back to this world after recruiting the post-apocalyptic knight errant.', 'King stopped a hundred feet away, stepped out of the car without visible weaponry. He had a high-caliber revolver in his jacket, two knives in his boots, and a pair of holdout pistols, but left the shotgun inside, the stock pointing toward the driver’s-side window. Ready and available, but not in hand.', 'The trio gathered themselves, an older woman with white hair hiding behind the other two. Before her was a girl, almost a woman, tall but gangly, clothes hanging loose, her skin nearly onyx with cool undertones. She held a rifle like she knew how to use it but hadn’t. Her form was tight. Too tight. Roman, Shirin, Mendoza, all the veteran fighters he knew had an ease to their grips. The Italians called it sprezzatura.', 'Here, it was just grit.', 'The third split the difference, mid-thirties probably, though he looked older. Everyone did here. This region rode people hard, chewed them up and spat them out desiccated. He had a pistol held high—too high, breaking the line of his wrist. It’d be a hell of a kickback if he fired.', 'King raised his voice, made it carry across the sand separating them. “Looks like you folks could use some help.”', '“Who the hell are you?” called the girl.', '“I’m Max.”', 'Even a hundred feet away, King could see the words strike home. The people here didn’t talk about Maxes, but each time he’d invoked the name, he could see the subconscious adjustment—like he slid into place in their minds.', '“So what?” the girl said. “You ain’t no one to us. The Skull Boys rule here. No stopping them.”', 'A Max rode solo, just him and the car, with a jacket. He arrived just in time to change the course of events to protect those that couldn’t protect themselves.', 'Maxes were this world’s guardian angels. Post-apocalyptic tricksters, culture heroes. King’s presentation to the High Council figured Max stories as this region’s equivalent to Jack tales from European folklore. They weren’t always named Max, King had found, just the first one, which gave the archetype its name. But every time he’d visited the region for a mission, there was either a Max figure in the story, or it had broken down because there wasn’t a Max figure. Like this one.', '“I’m Max,” King said, the repetition as much affirmation as insistence, “and I’m here to help. What happened?”', 'Now sixty feet away, King already had an answer to his question about what had happened to the group.', 'A crashed motorcycle. Dead body beside it, cracked cow’s-skull helmet caved into its wearer’s face.', 'Dead woman, maybe forty, in leathers and muslin like the survivors, grays and browns. Armored, but it hadn’t helped. Her body was riddled with bullet wounds and long gashes from blades. Her arms wrapped around another Skull Boy, body slacked.', 'She’d gone down fighting, had taken two of them with her. But they’d lost their ride, maybe some of their party.', 'But the cart—that had something interesting. He had his guess of what it could be but wanted to hear it from them.', 'Maxes were messengers, wasteland psychopomps. They got you where you needed to be to live your life, to make your own story.', 'This was the life Roman had walked away from. Constant danger, itinerant heroism without end.', 'He had a family now, a home.', 'But this world would always need a Max.', 'The older woman stood up from behind her protectors.', '“We came here for supplies. Xiao spotted this place, but the Skull Boys caught us while we were loading up.”', '“There were six of them, a raiding party. Four bikes and a war buggy. Artemis killed two, and they skipped out with our ride. Left just me, Sarah, and little Bo.”', '“I ain’t little,” Bo said with all the petulance of a teen trying to play older than their years.', 'King waved to the cart. “What supplies?”', 'The woman, Sarah, said, “This was an aid station. We found a mobile water filtration system. One of these can make two hundred gallons an hour when it’s working right. Triple filtration—minerals, muck, and breather deaths, all of it. Everything. We haven’t had clean drinking water in years.”', '“What about filters?”', '“Got filters, too,” the man said. “Enough for a lifetime.”', 'King approached, hands open. “Here’s the score. We load up as much as we can, hook the trailer to my rig, and then we drive as fast as can be for your Enclave. How far?”', 'Bo answered. “A hundred miles, down and up a valley, over a canyon. The Skull Boys don’t like to go past the canyon—too much sand and dust down there. It’s dirty.”', 'The woman added, “Irradiated.”', 'King nodded. “But you went through.”', '“We ain’t exactly flush, ', '.” The girl spat his name like a dart. She wasn’t sold on him as their savior. Not yet.', 'She was right to doubt. Maxes weren’t infallible—they lost their way, got swallowed up by the wasteland like Roman almost had been. They’d only trust King as far as they could use him, if that.', '“I can get you there. Payment in gasoline. Enough to get me back here, plus some extra. And some of those filters.”', '“Done,” Sarah said.', 'Xiao turned at her, doubt-wracked. “Can we trust him?”', '“You can trust me, or you can walk home. Even with a filter, you’ll need storms to get that far back, and more food than I ken, ’less you’ve got some cows inside all stealth-like.” King heightened the post-apocalypse cant to put them at ease, show that he was apart but not unlike. He belonged here as much as they did. Even if it was all a lie.', 'The three whispered. The girl waved the gun around, forgetting muzzle discipline in her passion. King flinched every time her arm swung around, the gun’s barrel crossing the line of his body.', 'They’d say yes. That’s how this story went. What wasn’t certain was who would survive. Who’d walk across the finish line, and with how much gas or blood or water remaining. This region wasn’t known for its clean endings.', '“Fine,” Sarah said. “We’ll pay your price, Max. Now get us home.”', 'King nodded, then started barking orders. “You, kid, you’re Bo?”', 'She raised her jaw. “Bo, daughter of Artemis, daughter of Lenae.” A lineage, and one to be proud of, judging by the child’s tone.', 'King nodded. “You keep watch. But not just the way they came from. Every which way. Put a swivel on.” Pointing at Xiao, he said, “You help me hook up the tow winch.” Then to Sarah: “Make sure everything’s loaded, and sort out whatever bullets and bangers you’ve got left. We motor in five.”', '\\xa0', 'Bo rode shotgun, head swiveling to watch the horizon in all directions. Xiao rode the still-functional motorcycle left by the Skull Boys. Sarah sat in the back with the spare guns and ammo.', 'The car’s engine moaned a complaint, dragging nearly a ton of extra weight between passengers and the cargo.', 'But it was still a Force. The Max always drove a Force. It was part and parcel with the guns, the jacket. Every legend had its raiment, its icons. But the raiment alone wasn’t enough to channel the legend.', 'King had worked four missions on this world, one before Roman, one with, then another two after Roman had joined the team. Two times as a Max. And not a single time had he come back without at least one broken bone or two pints down.', 'Stories patched hard in this world, just like everything else. Nothing came for free.', '“Eyes?” King asked.', '“No Skull Boys. Sandstorm in the distance; it’ll pass us by, most like. Jump to if not; we’ll be blasted.”', 'King looked at the storm in the distance. It was going the wrong way, but winds could change. “Gallon of diesel says it passes us by.”', '“No take, no take,” Bo said. She put up a good front, but she’d been biting her nails since they hit the road. They’d wrapped the dead and put them in the trunk, not willing to leave them for buzzards. Another three hundred pounds in his trunk. The closure was worth the ballast. Assuming they made it. If not, they’d all ride to the boneyards together.', '“How’re we for ammo?” King asked. He knew, but keeping them busy, their minds occupied, would do them good. He was the calm at the center of the storm. They revolved around him, carried in the wake of a Max.', '“Same as last time. Ten shells, three magazines for Bo’s popper, and fifteen shots for the hand cannon.”', 'King looked ahead. A few miles ahead was a rent in the earth, probably from an earthquake or the like. It looked like something from during the world’s breaking, not before.', '“Drought-damn-rad-faak!” Bo said, looking back.', '“What you ken?” King asked.', '“Skull Boys on our tail, motoring.”', 'King looked through the rear- and side-view mirrors but caught nothing.', '“How many, Bo? And where’s the road down the canyon?”', '“To the right, beneath the triangle rock,” Sarah said.', 'King spied the rock and pulled the wheel. But crossing would cost him time, and the Skull Boys would be faster. If he could get onto the incline before they caught up, it’d limit their options. But then he’d be pushing the engine to its limit getting them back up.', 'Soon enough, he saw the Skull Boys. Three bikes, then a dune buggy with a scrap-metal hull, jagged edges and amateur welds, shaking as it slalomed over the broken road.', 'He could handle three.', 'One eye on the road, King flashed Xiao a closed fist, the signal for him to keep the Skull Boys from flanking the car. They’d had all of minutes to work out signals, and he hoped they’d stick in a crisis. These people lived on the edge every day, but adrenaline and fear made for a dangerous cocktail.', '“Scissors means flank them. Rock means keep them from flanking me. Paper means stay tight. One finger means go ahead of me. Four means drop back.”', 'Xiao dropped back behind the Runner, ready to veer either way to keep the Skull Boys at bay.', 'But first, they’d go down the ramp.', '“How sharp can I take the curve?”', '“How good are you?”', '“How sharp?” King asked, an edge in his voice.', '“Forty at most, unless your tires are made of glue.”', 'The tires weren’t glue, but they were as good as anyone got in that world, but not so good they’d stick out.', 'Which meant slowing down. King swung wide and started the curve before hitting the ramp, slowing as the car kicked up a cloud of dust.', 'The ramp was worn down, but only just. On horseback, it’d have been easy. Maybe even on bikes. But in a four-wheeler with a trailer, they rocked and bobbed and shook. His skull vibrated, hands straining as he kept the wheel steady, forearms straining.', 'The Skull Boys took the turn sharp, a leader with a massive mane, fur or wig, catching dust and flaring like a monstrous mandorla as he lobbed a Molotov cocktail.', 'It had something in it for extra kick, making a spider web of his back windshield. But the window held.', '“That shield goes out, you duck down, stay out of view. Bo, eyes back; start taking potshots. You ken?”', '“I ken. Ma taught me to shoot grace-like. I’ll pop ’em.”', '“You do that. Pop ’em for your ma.”', 'Bo shifted, turning backward, using the seat as her rifle stand. “No good. Too far. They zooming, weaving.”', '“Wait for them to close in. They’ll stop weaving.”', 'A beat. Then a nod. She wasn’t quite ready to believe.', 'Switchback ahead. There’d be an opportunity to gain time, but not for him. No way to jump that corner without damaging the cargo. He threw the parking brake and pulled a bootleg turn. The cart scraped along the side of the cavern but righted itself, on too short a swivel to overcorrect the other way. King dropped the brake and hit the gas halfway down toward the valley.', 'The valley was bone-dry, all the water sucked up long before. The ground floor was rubble, half-cleared to make a road.', 'Which meant cover.', 'One of the bikes made the jump, took the landing hard on its shocks, wobbling, but they came after, no more than ten feet back. They’d jumped past Xiao entirely. The scout popped off shots from his pistol, but he was a rider, not a shooter, and the bullets went wide around the more experienced driver.', 'Another Molotov shattered the windshield, a flash of heat and dust piercing the air as the car’s weak seal broke. Dust and air and howling wind and the roar of tires on dirt filled King’s ears.', 'It was on. He pulled down the goggles, motoring ahead into the half-cleared path. Scrapes and bangs rattled up as the car rumbled over the rough terrain.', 'The window broken, King pulled the shotgun from the sheath by his left foot. He leaned out the window, gun first, taking a quick left-handed shot at one of the bikers, trusting himself to keep the Force on the road with one hand. The Skull Boy turned sharp, ramping up onto the broken earth, but the shot missed. King corrected and fired again, aiming down at the front wheel.', 'The buckshot hit the motorcycle like a bowling ball, mangling the machinery. The Skull Boy bailed out, taking the fall well.', '“Reload!” King passed the shotgun back to Susan and returned his focus to the road.', 'A few seconds later, the dismounted Skull Boy’s companion drove up and picked him up. Once settled, the passenger loaded a crossbow and the bolt punched through the door frame behind King’s head. Not quite behind. The back of his heat felt hot. He moved slightly to test. Just a graze.', 'Where was Xiao?', 'The scout and his bike appeared as King swerved right to stay on the path. Behind and to the right, Xiao leaned into the bike to stay out of the clutches of the dune buggy. The passenger in the car had a wicked scythe, leaning out of the car and swiping at the bike.', '“Take out that cutter!” King commanded. Bo shifted, taking aim. She fired once, twice, three times as the buggy and bike danced along the narrow road, Xiao driving with great skill taxed to the desperate end. The buggy was better equipped for the broken valley floor, powerful shocks compensating for the bike’s greater speed.', '“Ready!” Susan said, the stock popping into King’s peripheral vision.', 'He grabbed the gun and leaned into a turn, stilling his mind as he lined up a shot. The world slowed, action-hero cinematic adrenaline giving him the time he needed to aim an otherwise-impossible shot.', 'Even in a region of action world, King didn’t often get slow-mo. Roman could tap into it far better, but he wasn’t there. King took his blessings where they came and fired, shattering the scythe mid-swing.', 'But even with the blade shattered, the pole was long enough, the swing true.', 'The pole slid through and cracked in the rear wheel of the bike, sending Xiao flying.', '“Xiao!” Bo cried, firing faster now.', '“Breathe. Aim. Kill,” King instructed. He looked away from the wreck and brought the car out of the turn. Ahead was a straightaway stretch, several hundred feet before the so-called road curved back around toward the ramp up to the far side of the valley.', 'The two-rider bike came up on him, the pair leaning into the turn. The bolt bounced off his hubcap mere inches from the tire.', 'King juked the car back and forth, stones scraping and cracking on the door as he dodged. But it wasn’t enough.', 'A tire popped, and the car slumped, dragging. They’d hit the tire.', '“Pop that crossbowman now, kid!” King called, straining to keep the car on-track. The Runner had run-flats, but they weren’t perfect. Especially not with that much cargo.', 'Bo hit the driver, sending the bike wobbling as the crossbow-man tried to steady his companion.', 'King pushed the car forward, testing its limits with the run-flat tire. The choking sound and straining of belts told him this was as fast as it went.', 'Couldn’t speed up, couldn’t dodge and weave as fast as them. Which meant it was time for the explosives.', '“Sarah. Grey bag,” he said, eyes on the road, watching the side-view mirrors. “Pull the pins and then you have a five count. Throw on two; make sure they’re at least twenty feet away from us or the gear. You ken?”', '“I ken,” she said, rummaging.', 'Sarah eyed the Skull Boys out the shattered rear windshield, throwing on two as instructed. The first grenade caught the two-man bikers as they struggled to keep up, consumed in a plume of flame and dust.', 'That left one biker and the buggy. If they could wreck the last bike, maybe they’d be able to get away once they hit the bridge.', 'King felt options narrowing with each grenade thrown, each bullet spent, every mile they drove.', 'It’d have to be enough.', 'The ramp up the far side of the valley began with a full switchback. The weight and repetition of thousands of wheels had packed down the earth for a wide approach, which King took, riding the edge of what the Runner could handle with a run-flat and a thousand pounds of cargo.', '“Hang on!” he called as they hit the ramp, and King pulled the parking brake and then hauled on the wheel with his entire body.', 'The tires squealed as the car swung around, centripetal force slamming King and his passengers to the right. Bo crashed into the passenger’s-side window, and the entire back-seat, from ammo to engineer, lurched and scattered, shells rattling against the window like hail.', 'King released the brake and put the pedal to the metal, willing the car forward. “Come on, come on.”', 'The remaining bike took a jump off of a stack of rocks and arced up and up and directly onto the ramp ahead of their car.', '“Shit.” King leaned out the driver’s-side window, firing the shotgun, trying to catch the rider before he’d settled out the momentum from the jump.', 'But the biker dodged right, running up the side of the valley and ramping back onto the path.', 'King dropped the shotgun behind him, calling, “Reload!” He picked up the pistol and took aim.', 'The sights pointed directly at another Molotov, which exploded against the front windshield. Shards caught King in the shoulder and grazed his face.', 'The car lurched left as he flinched in pain, heading for the cliff.', 'King hit the safety, dropping the pistol into his lap to put both hands on the wheel again while his vision went red with blood.', '“Damnit. Bo, do you have a shot?” he asked, muscling the car to stay on the ramp as it scaled ever upward.', '“Dune buggy’s right behind us. Shoot forward or back?” Bo asked.', '“Forward!”', 'Ahead, the biker dropped a satchel full of something. In this region, “satchel full of something” was never good news.', 'Concussive force rocked the car as something exploded below. A high-pitched whistling joined the cacophony. A line burst or shredded.', '“What was that?” Sarah asked.', '“Don’t know. Can’t deal with it now. How’s that reload?”', 'Something appeared by his left ear. He reached up and took hold of the shotgun once more. He had two bad options. Steer with the wounded arm or fire with it. He chose bad option A.', 'Half-standing out the window, King leaned over, open air and hundreds of feet of nothingness beneath him.', 'The Skull Boy let loose with a crossbow bolt, which buried itself in the windshield right at his head level. That was going to be a problem.', 'But not just yet.', 'He blinked the blood out of his eye, exhaled, and fired.', 'The buckshot hit the Skull Boy in the shoulder, and the biker slumped, taking the motorcycle racing off the edge of the path and down to a rocky end.', 'King sat back into the seat, faced with an opaque spider-webbing of cracked glass before him. But he could see well enough to know road from not road.', 'For now.', '“Reload!” he said, passing the shotgun back to Sarah.', '“Dune buggy coming up!” she answered.', '“Poppers for shite! Won’t but crack their glass!”', 'King watched the buggy. “Go for the tires.”', 'The Skull Boys leaned out his window and fired another crossbow bolt.', 'Sarah cried out. Rearview told King she’d taken it in the shoulder, several inches in from the joint, right at the top of where her lungs might be.', '“Sarah!” Bo said, her gun forgotten.', '“Keep firing,” King said. “Best way to help her is to end the fight.”’', 'Sarah slumped in the back seat, the shotgun forgotten. King grabbed the pistol. But he wasn’t half the driver he’d need to be to drive and fire a sidearm backwards. His shoulders were too broad, arms too short. Some people had gorilla arms, incredible reach, like Roman. King was not one of them. He could look over his shoulder and fire inside the car, but that’d deafen them right quick.', 'Which meant Bo was their only shooter remaining.', '“Keep firing, Bo. Nearly there, ken?”', 'Bo’s gaze was locked on Sarah, the older woman bleeding out on the leather seats.', 'Crossbow bolts kept flying. They kept Bo pinned down, firing every other time she did, spoiling her shots and keeping her afraid.', 'They came up to another switchback, and King had to brake in order to take it without losing the cargo. As it was, the cart slammed into the wall, several smaller pieces falling loose of the crossbars of the trailer’s cage.', '“Almost to the top. Keep firing, Bo. You can do this. Your mother would be proud. But you have to be the fighter now. You have to protect us.”', 'Bo shook in her seat, holding the rifle close. She was flailing, looking for something, anything to hold onto. To lose your mother, to see such violence all at once, right when she thought she was ready, when she thought she wanted to step into the role.', 'It was one thing to want to be a fighter, to train.', 'It was something else to walk the path, to pull the trigger.', 'But Maxes weren’t just guardians; they were inspiration. They called people to their better natures. “You can do this, Bo. I need your help. We’re none of us getting home unless we do it together.”', 'King put the car through one more turn and pulled up onto the plateau. Ahead was a narrow stone bridge, no more than twenty feet wide. And it looked like it got narrower at the top.', '“Heading for the bridge now. We need to keep them behind or get them dead,” King said. “Whatever you think of me, know that I need you to step up. You come from a line of heroes. Their blood runs in you. It’s fuel; use it.”', 'Bo straightened, her posture set, relaxed. She’d found her grit. She leaned out the window and started firing, even as the crossbow bolts clanged inches from her face.', 'King pushed the car to its limits, thumping growing louder as the outer tire continued to shear, threatening to take the inner tire with it.', 'On the straightaway, the dune buggy revved and started to catch up.', '“Stop them, Bo. They’re coming up on my side!”', 'It was smart. Put the shooter on the far side of their own car, come up on King’s side where they could attack him directly.', 'The car thumped up onto the bridge, racing for the apex, where the bridge narrowed to ten, maybe fifteen feet. Not nearly enough for two cars abreast.', 'Bo fired off one more shot and then cursed as the buggy passed out of her range. King fired out the window, the pistol rounds doing a whole lot of nothing. Everything shook too much for him to land a good shot through the window.', 'Then, out of nowhere, a bike came roaring up onto the plateau behind them, moving at top speed.', 'But the rider wasn’t a Skull Boy. It was Xiao. The left side of his face was covered in blood, but even from a hundred feet away, he had determination in his eyes.', '“Xiao’s alive!” King said. “We can do this!” he shouted, as much to himself as his passengers.', 'Xiao and his bike closed the distance, the bike undamaged, unlike the hobbled Runner and battered buggy. But rather than harrying the buggy from behind or shooting up the middle to try to force the buggy off, he took the wide way, sliding in on the buggy’s left, bike riding the razor’s edge.', 'King tried to signal the biker, to make a plan.', 'But Xiao already had a plan. The cars closed on one another, the passenger Skull Boy slashing at King with a knife. King leaned inside the car, raising the windshield. The Skull Boy grabbed the raising windshield and shoved it down, leaning on it with arms thick with muscle, the wrists of a road veteran.', 'A signal.', 'Xiao gave the signal to break, then counted down. Three fingers. Two. One.', 'He jumped out off of his bike and grabbed the wheel of the dune buggy, pulling the car left.', 'King hit the brakes, dropping behind the dune buggy. The Skull Boy driver slashed Xiao’s arms with a jagged bone knife, hauling the wheel the other way.', 'Too far. Without the Force Runner to stop its movement, the dune buggy, going seventy miles an hour, chewed up the width of the narrow bridge before the Skull Boy could even out the wheel. The dune buggy shot right off, Xiao holding on even though he was plummeting to a doom of his own design, watching as King and the Runner drove on unimpeded.', 'The bridge was already too narrow for repairs, so King hit the throttle again.', 'They were safe. They were through. Xiao had seen to it. The Max had inspired another champion, borne witness to their deeds, and he would see them home.', 'King hit the throttle, and guided the Force on the last leg of the journey to the Enclave.', '\\xa0', 'The car was beat to hell and running on fumes by the time they made it to the enclave. He’d lost probably a unit of blood down his front, jacket and pants soaked, seat too. The car’s fuel line had been shredded; it’d need patching. But they’d made it.', 'They passed a watchtower ahead of a gate drawn across the narrow path leading up to a plateau inset on a butte. Naturally defensible, a good spot, dug into the cliff. It had the marks of an engineer’s work—Sarah.', 'The group was greeted by a half-dozen tired and scared survivors.', 'King carried Sarah up to them—not many people would slit your throat when you were carrying wounded, even if you were a half-deaf stranger whose hands wouldn’t stop shaking, whose heart kept pounding.', 'Roman was an adrenaline junkie, a natural-born Max.', 'King was just playing the part.', '“What happened?” an older survivor said, leaning on a hand-carved cane as King approached.', 'Bo ran up to the group, talking a mile a minute.', 'A pair of younger men took Sarah from King and laid her out on a flat, clean rock. Another woman ran up with a bag, gauze and tubing and supplies. They had a proper doctor, or close enough.', 'Bo relayed their trip, the ambush, King’s arrival, and their escape. She didn’t stop moving, one hand touching the rifle at all times, like a talisman she was afraid would disappear if she let it go.', '“Max,” the leader said, turning to King. “Thank you. You’ve saved us.”', '“Couldn’t save everyone.”', '“You did plenty, Max,” Bo said. “Just like you said.”', 'The leader nodded. “Please, stay. I can fix you up. We have food, water, and gasoline to see you off.”', 'The group grew closer, watching him like he was an elephant in a zoo. Children peeked out from behind their parents’ tattered clothes, hair wild, eyes wide.', '“We ain’t seen someone like you in years. Just Skull Boys,” said a dust-covered girl with 4c hair and umber skin.', '“Thought maybe there weren’t nobody brave enough to be a Max left.” A boy, East Asian heritage, his hair clipped short.', 'A taller boy with fair skin, wrapped in cloths but still sunburned. “Or they’d all died out.”', 'King walked back to his car, unlatched the trunk. His cargo was still there.', '“Did what I could. And I’d be honored to eat with you all. But first, we oughta bury the victorious dead.”', 'King stayed the night. He shared stories of his exploits—mostly Roman’s exploits, and the survivors shared their few stories of other heroes, none of them newer than three years. Were the Genrenauts the only ones willing to be Maxes anymore? Something to put in his report. Or maybe their interference had colonized the archetype, edged out the region’s ability to generate its own heroes.', ', he told himself.', 'The next morning, Sarah brought him three jugs of crystal-clear water. He refused two of them—he’d be returning to HQ, and they’d need it more than he did. Bo brought him a hand-carved wooden car that read Max along the top.', 'They filled his tank and gave him a fresh wheel. The rest of the repairs took until noon.', 'Once the heat broke, they saw him off with grateful waves and a teary Bo.', 'That’s how it was when you were a Max. Never staying, never settling.', 'King might never be truly comfortable in the role. But as long as he still breathed, as long as he could still drive and fight?', 'There would always be a Max.', '\\xa0', '“There Will Always Be a Max” copyright © 2016 by Michael R.

      "{'Title': ['Terminal'], 'Author': ['Lavie Tidhar'], 'Body': ['“Terminal” by Lavie Tidhar is an emotionally wrenching science fiction story about people, who, either having nothing to lose or having a deep desire to go into space, travel to Mars via cheap, one-person, one-way vehicles dubbed jalopies. During the trip, those in the swarm communicate with each other, their words relayed to those left behind.', '\\n', '\\xa0', 'From above the ecliptic the swarm can be seen as a cloud of minute bullet-shaped insects, their hulls, packed with photovoltaic cells, capturing the sunlight; tiny, tiny flames burning in the vastness of the dark.', 'They crawl with unbearable slowness across this small section of near space, beetles climbing a sheer obsidian rock face. Only the sun remains constant. The sun, always, dominates their sky.', 'Inside each jalopy are instrument panels and their like; a sleeping compartment where you must float your way into the secured sleeping bag; a toilet to strap yourself to; a kitchen to prepare your meal supply; and windows to look out of. With every passing day the distance from Earth increases and the time-lag grows a tiny bit longer and the streaming of communication becomes more echoey, the most acute reminder of that finite parting as the blue-green egg that is Earth revolves and grows smaller in your window, and you stand there, sometimes for hours at a time, fingers splayed against the plastic, staring at what has gone and will never come again, for your destination is terminal.', 'There is such freedom in the letting go.', 'There is the music. Mei listens to the music, endlessly. Alone she floats in her cheap jalopy, and the music soars all about her, an archive of all the music of Earth stored in five hundred terabytes or so, so that Mei can listen to anything ever written and performed, should she so choose, and so she does, in a glorious random selection as the jalopy moves in the endless swarm from Earth to Terminal. Chopin’s Études bring a sharp memory of rain and the smell of wet grass, of damp books and days spent in bed, staring out of windows, the feel of soft sheets and warm pyjamas, a steaming mug of tea. Mei listens to Vanuatu string band songs in pidgin English, evocative of palm trees and sand beaches and graceful men swaying in the wind; she listens to Congolese kwasa kwasa and dances, floating, shaking and rolling in weightlessness, the music like an infectious laugh and hot tropical rain. The Beatles sing “Here Comes the Sun,” Mozart’s Requiem trails off unfinished, David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” haunts the cramped confines of the jalopy: the human race speaks to Mei through notes like precise mathematical notations, and, alone, she floats in space, remembering in the way music always makes you remember.', 'She is not unhappy.', 'At first, there was something seemingly inhuman about using the toilets. It is like a hungry machine, breathing and spitting, and Mei must ride it, strapping herself into leg restraints, attaching the urine funnel, which gurgles and hisses as Mei evacuates waste. Now the toilet is like an old friend, its conversation a constant murmur, and she climbs in and out without conscious notice.', 'At first, Mei slept and woke up to a regiment of day and night, but a month out of Earth orbit, the old order began to slowly crumble, and now she sleeps and wakes when she wants, making day and night appear as if by magic, by a wave of her hand. Still, she maintains a routine, of washing and the brushing of teeth, of wearing clothing, a pretence at humanity which is sometimes hard to maintain being alone. A person is defined by other people.', 'Three months out of Earth and it’s hard to picture where you’d left, where you’re going. And always that word, like a whisper out of nowhere, Terminal, Terminal…', 'Mei floats and turns slowly in space, listening to the Beach Boys.', '“I have to do this.”', '“You don’t have to,” she says. “You don’t have to do anything. What you mean is that you want to. You want to do it. You think it makes you special but it doesn’t make you special if everyone else is doing it.” She looks at him with fierce black eyes and tucks a strand of hair, clumped together in her perspiration, behind her ear. He loves her very much at that moment, that fierce protectiveness, the fact someone, anyone, can look at you that way, can look at you and feel love.', '“Not everyone is doing it.”', 'They’re sitting in a cafe outdoors and it is hot, it is very hot, and overhead, the twin Petronas Towers rise like silver rockets into the air. In the square outside KLCC, the water features twinkle in the sun and tourists snap photos and waiters glide like unenthusiastic penguins amongst the clientele. He drinks from his kopi ice and traces a trail of moisture on the face of the glass, slowly. “You are not ', ',” she says, at last, the words coming as from a great distance. He nods, reluctantly. It is true. He is not dying, not immediately anyway; only in the sense that all living things are dying, that there is a trajectory, the way a jalopy makes its slow but finite way from Earth to Mars. Speaking of jalopies, there is a stand under the awnings, for such stands are everywhere now, and a man shouting through the sound system to come one, come all and take the ultimate trip—and so on, and so forth.', 'But more than that, implicit in her words is the question: is he dying? In the more immediate sense? “No,” he says. “But.”', 'That word lies heavy in the hot and humid air.', 'She is still attractive to him, even now: even after thirty years, three kids now grown and gone into the world, her hair no longer black all over but flecked with strands of white and grey, his own hair mostly gone, their hands, touching lightly across the table, both showing the signs of gravity and age. And how could he explain?', '“Space,” he tries to say. “The dark starry night which is eternal and forever, or as long as these words mean something in between the beginning and the end of spaceandtime.” But really, is it selfish, is it not inherently ', ' to want to leave, to go, up there and beyond—for what? It makes no sense, or no more sense than anything else you do or don’t.', '“Responsibility,” she says. “Commitment. Love, damn it, Haziq! You’re not a child, playing with toys, with, with… with ', ' or whatever. You have children, a family, we’ll soon have grandkids if I know Omar, what will they do without you?”', 'These hypothetical people, not yet born, already laying demands to his time, his being. To be human is to exist in potentia, unborn responsibilities rising like butterflies in a great big obscuring cloud. He waves his hand in front of his face, but whether it is to shoo them away or because of the heat, he cannot say. “We always said we won’t stand in each other’s way,” he begins, but awkwardly, and she starts to cry, silently, making no move to wipe away the tears, and he feels a great tenderness but also anger, and the combination shocks him. “I have never asked for anything,” he says. “I have… Have I not been a good son, a good father, a good husband? I never asked for anything—” and he remembers sneaking away one night, five years before, and wandering the Petaling Street Market with television screens blaring and watching a launch, and a thin string of pearls, broken, scattered across space… Perhaps it was then, perhaps it was earlier, or once when he was a boy and he had seen pictures of a vast red planet unmarred by human feet…', '“What did I ask,” she says, “did I complain, did I aspire, did I not fulfil what you and I both wanted? Yes,” she says, “yes, it is selfish to want to go, and it is selfish to ask you to stay, but if you go, Haziq, you won’t come back. You won’t ever come back.”', 'And he says, “I know,” and she shakes her head, and she is no longer crying, and there is that hard, practical look in her eyes, the one he was always a little bit afraid of. She picks up the bill and roots in her purse and brings out the money and puts it on the table. “I have to go,” she says, “I have an appointment at the hairdresser’s.” She gets up and he does not stand to stop her, and she walks away; and he knows that all he has to do is follow her; and yet he doesn’t, he remains seated, watching her weaving her way through the crowds, until she disappears inside the giant mall; and she never once looks back.', 'But really, it is the sick, the slowly dying, those who have nothing to lose, those untied by earthly bonds, those whose spirits are as light as air: the loners and the crazy and worst of all the artists, so many artists, each convinced in his or her own way of the uniqueness of the opportunity, exchanging life for immortality, floating, transmuting space into art in the way of the dead, for they are legally dead, now, each in his or her own jalopy, this cheap mass-manufactured container made for this one singular trip, from this planet to the next, from the living world to the dead one.', '“Sign here, initial here, and here, and here—” and what does it feel like for those everyday astronauts, those would-be Martians, departing their homes for one last time, a last glance back, some leaving gladly, some tearfully, some with indifference: these Terminals, these walking dead, having signed over their assets, completed their wills, attended, in some instances, their very own wakes: leaving with nothing, boarding taxis or flights in daytime or night, to the launch site for rudimentary training with instruments they will never use, from Earth to orbit in a space plane, a reusable launch vehicle, and thence to Gateway, in low Earth orbit, that ramshackle construction floating like a spider web in the skies of Earth, made up of modules, some new, some decades old, joined together in an ungainly fashion, a makeshift thing.', '\\xa0', '…Here we are all astronauts. The permanent staff is multinational, harassed; monkey-like, we climb heel and toe heel and toe, handholds along the walls no up no down but three-dimensional space as a many-splendoured thing. Here the astronauts are trained hastily in maintaining their craft and themselves, and the jalopies extend out of Gateway, beyond orbit, thousands of cheap little tin cans aimed like skipping stones at the big red rock yonder.', 'Here, too, you can still change your mind. Here comes a man now, a big man, an American man, with very white face and hands, a man used to being in control, a man used to being deferred to—an artist, in fact; a writer. He had made his money imagining the way the future was, but the future had passed him by and he found himself spending his time on message boards and the like, bemoaning youth and their folly. Now he has a new lease on life, or thought he had, with this plan of going into space, to Terminal Beach: six months floating in a tin can high above no world, to write his masterpiece, the thing he is to be remembered by, his ', ', damn it, in which he’s to lay down his entire philosophical framework of a libertarian bent: only he has, at the last moment, perhaps on smelling the interior of his assigned jalopy, changed his mind. Now he comes inexpertly floating like a beach ball down the shaft, bouncing here and there from the walls and bellowing for the agent, those sleazy jalopymen, for the final signature on the contract is digital, and sent once the jalopy is slingshot to Mars. It takes three orderlies to hold him, and a nurse injects him with something to calm him down. Later, he would go back down the gravity well, poorer yet wiser, but he will never write that novel: space eludes him.', 'Meanwhile, the nurse helps carry the now-unconscious American down to the hospital suite, a house-sized unit overlooking the curve of the Earth. Her name is Eliza and she watches day chase night across the globe and looks for her home, for the islands of the Philippines to come into view, their lights scattered like shards of shining glass, but it is the wrong time to see them. She monitors the IV distractedly, feeling tiredness wash over her like the first exploratory wave of a grey and endless sea. For Eliza, space means always being in sight of this great living world, this Earth, its oceans and its green landmasses and its bright night lights, a world that dominates her view, always, that glares like an eye through pale white clouds. To be this close to it and yet to see it separate, not of it but apart, is an amazing thing; while beyond, where the Terminals go, or farther yet, where the stars coalesce as thick as clouds, who knows what lies? And she fingers the gold cross on the chain around her neck, as she always does when she thinks of things alien beyond knowing, and she shudders, just a little bit; but everywhere else, so far, the universe is silent, and we alone shout.', '“Hello? Is it me you’re looking for?”', '“Who is this?”', '“Hello?”', '“This is jalopy A-5011 sending out a call to the faithful to prayer –”', '“This is Bremen in B-9012, is there anyone there? Hello? I am very weak. Is there a doctor, can you help me, I do not think I’ll make it to the rock, hello, hello—”', '“This is jalopy B-2031 to jalopy C-3398, bishop to king 7, I said bishop to king 7, take that Shen you twisted old fruit!”', '“Hello? Has anyone heard from Shiri Applebaum in C-5591, has anyone heard from Shiri Applebaum in C-5591, she has not been in touch in two days and I am getting worried, this is Robin in C-5523, we were at Gateway together before the launch, hello, hello—”', '“Hello—”', 'Mei turns down the volume of the music and listens to the endless chatter of the swarm rise alongside it, day or night, neither of which matter or exist here, unbound by planetary rotation and that old artificial divide of darkness and the light. Many like Mei have abandoned the twenty-four hour cycle to sleep and rise ceaselessly and almost incessantly with some desperate need to ', ' all of this, this one-time-only journey, this slow beetle’s crawl across trans-solar space. Mei swoops and turns with the music and the chatter, and she idly wonders of the fate to have befallen Shiri Applebaum in C-5591: is she merely keeping quiet or is she dead or in a coma, never to wake up again, only her corpse and her cheap little jalopy hitting the surface of Mars in ninety more days? Across the swarm’s radio network, the muezzin in A-5011 sends out the call to prayer, the singsong words so beautiful that Mei stops, suspended in mid air, and breathes deeply, her chest rising and falling steadily, space all around her. She has degenerative bone disease, there isn’t a question of starting a new life at Terminal, only this achingly beautiful song that rises all about her, and the stars, and silent space.', 'Two days later Bremen’s calls abruptly cease. B-9012 still hurtles on with the rest towards Mars. Haziq tries to picture Bremen: what was he like? What did he love? He thinks he remembers him, vaguely, a once-fat man now wasted with folded awkward skin, large glasses, a Scandinavian man maybe, Haziq thought, but all he knows or will ever know of Bremen is the man’s voice on the radio, bouncing from jalopy to jalopy and on to Earth where jalopy-chasers scan the bands and listen in a sort of awed or voyeuristic pleasure.', '“This is Haziq, C-6173…” He coughs and clears his throat. He drinks his miso soup awkwardly, suckling from its pouch. He sits formally, strapped by Velcro, the tray of food before him, and out of his window he stares not back to Earth or forward to Mars but directly onto the swarm, trying to picture each man and woman inside, trying to imagine what brought them here. Does one need a reason? Haziq wonders. Or is it merely that gradual feeling of discomfort in one’s own life, one’s own skin, a slowly dawning realisation that you have passed like a grey ghost through your own life, leaving no impression, that soon you might fade away entirely, to dust and ash and nothingness, a mild regret in your children’s minds that they never really knew you at all.', '“This is Haziq, C-6173, is there anyone hearing me, my name is Haziq and I am going to Terminal”—and a sudden excitement takes him. “My name is Haziq and I am going to Terminal!” he shouts, and all around him the endless chatter rises, of humans in space, so needy for talk like sustenance, “We’re all going to Terminal!” and Haziq, shy again, says, “Please, is there anyone there, won’t someone talk to me. What is it like, on Terminal?”', 'But that is a question that brings down the silence; it is there in the echoes of words ords rds and in the pauses, in punctuation missing or overstated, in the endless chess moves, worried queries, unwanted confessionals, declarations of love, in this desperate sudden ', ' that binds them together, the swarm, and makes all that has been before become obsolete, lose definition and meaning. For the past is a world one cannot return to, and the future is a world none has seen.', 'Mei floats half-asleep half-awake, but the voice awakens her. Why ', ' voice, she never knows, cannot articulate. “Hello. Hello. Hello…” And she swims through the air to the kitchenette and heats up tea and drinks it from the suction cup. There are no fizzy drinks on board the jalopies, the lack of gravity would not separate liquid and gas in the human stomach, and the astronaut would wet-burp vomit. Mei drinks slowly, carefully; all her movements are careful. “Hello?” she says, “Hello, this is Mei in A-3357, this is Mei in A-3357, can you hear me, Haziq, can you hear me?”', 'A pause, a micro-silence, the air filled with the hundreds of other conversations through which a voice, his voice, says, “This is Haziq! Hello, A-3357, hello!”', '“Hello,” Mei says, surprised and strangely happy, and she realises it is the first time she has spoken in three months. “Let me tell you, Haziq,” she says, and her voice is like music between worlds, “let me tell you about Terminal.”', 'It was raining in the city. She had come out of the hospital and looked up at the sky and saw nothing there, no stars no sun, just clouds and smoke and fog. It rained, the rain collected in rainbow puddles in the street, the chemicals inside it painted the world and made it brighter. There was a jalopy vendor on the corner of the street, above his head a promotional video in 3D, and she was drawn to it. The vendor played loud K-pop and the film looped in on itself, but Mei didn’t mind the vendor’s shouts, the smell of acid rain or frying pork sticks and garlic or the music’s beat which rolled on like thunder. Mei stood and rested against the stand and watched the video play. The vendor gave her glasses, embossed with the jalopy sub-agent’s logo. She watched the swarm like a majestic silver web spread out across space, hurtling (or so it seemed) from Earth to Mars. The red planet was so beautiful and round, its dry seas and massive mountain peaks, its volcanoes and canals. She watched the polar ice caps. Watched Olympus Mons breaking out of the atmosphere. Imagined a mountain so high, it reached up into space. Imagined women like her climbing it, smaller than ants but with that same ferocious dedication. Somewhere on that world was Terminal.', '“Picture yourself standing on the red sands for the very first time,” she tells Haziq, her voice the same singsong of the muezzin at prayer, “that very first step, the mark of your boot in the fine sand. It won’t stay there forever, you know. This is not the moon, the winds will come and sweep it away, reminding you of the temporality of all living things.” And she pictures Armstrong on the moon, that first impossible step, the mark of the boots in the lunar dust. “But you are on a different world now,” she says, to Haziq or to herself, or to the others listening, and the jalopy-chasers back on Earth. “With different moons hanging like fruit in the sky. And you take that first step in your suit, the gravity hits you suddenly, you are barely able to drag yourself out of the jalopy, everything is labour and pain. Who knew gravity could hurt so much,” she says, as though in wonder. She closes her eyes and floats slowly upwards, picturing it. She can see it so clearly, Terminal Beach where the jalopies wash ashore, endlessly, like seashells, as far as the eye can see the sand is covered in the units out of which a temporary city rises, a tent city, all those bright objects on the sand. “And as you emerge into the sunlight they stand there, welcoming you, can you see them? In suits and helmets, they extend open arms, those Martians, ', ', they say, over the radio comms, ', ', and you follow, painfully and awkwardly, leaving tracks in the sand, into the temporary domes and the linked-together jalopies and the underground caves which they are digging, always, extending this makeshift city downwards, and you pass through the airlock and take off your helmet and breathe the air, and you are no longer alone, you are amongst people, real people, not just voices carried on the solar winds.”', 'She falls silent then. Breathes the limited air of the cabin. “They would be planting seeds,” she says, softly, “underground, and in greenhouses, all the plants of Earth, a paradise of watermelons and orchids, of frangipani and durian, jasmine and rambutan…” She breathes deeply, evenly. The pain is just a part of her, now. She no longer takes the pills they gave her. She wants to be herself; pain and all.', 'In jalopies scattered across this narrow silver band, astronauts like canned sardines marinate in their own stale sweat and listen to her voice. Her words, converted into a signal inaudible by human ears, travel across local space for whole minutes until they hit the Earth’s atmosphere at last, already old and outdated, a record of a past event; here they bounce off the Earth to the ionosphere and back again, jaggedy waves like a terminal patient’s heart monitor circumnavigating this rotating globe until they are deciphered by machines and converted once more into sound:', 'Mei’s voice speaking into rooms, across hospital beds, in dark bars filled with the fug of electronic cigarettes’ smoke-like vapoured steam, in lonely bedrooms where her voice keeps company to cats, in cabs driving through rain and from tinny speakers on white sand beaches where coconut crabs emerge into sunset, their blue metallic shells glinting like jalopies. Mei’s voice soothes unease and fills the jalopy-chasers’ minds with bright images, a panoramic view of a red world seen from space, suspended against the blackness of space; the profusion of bright galaxies and stars behind it is like a movie screen.', '“Take a step, and then another and another. The sunlight caresses your skin, but its rays have travelled longer to reach you, and when you raise your head the sun shines down from a clay-red sun, and you know you will never again see the sky blue. Think of that light. It has travelled longer and faster than you ever will, its speed in vacuum a constant 299,792,458 meters per second. Think of that number, that strange little fundamental constant, seemingly arbitrary: around that number faith can be woven and broken like silk, for is it a randomly created universe we live in or an ordained one? Why the speed of light, why the gravitational constant, why Planck’s? And as you stand there, healthy or ill, on the sands of Terminal Beach and raise your face to the sun, are you happy or sad?”', 'Mei’s voice makes them wonder, some simply and with devotion, some uneasily. But wonder they do, and some will go outside one day and encounter the ubiquitous stand of a jalopyman and be seduced by its simple promise, abandon everything to gain a nebulous idea, that boot mark in the fine-grained red sand, so easily wiped away by the winds.', 'And Mei tells Haziq about Olympus Mons and its shadow falling on the land and its peak in space, she tells him of the falling snow, made of frozen carbon dioxide, of men and women becoming children again, building snowmen in the airless atmosphere, and she tells him of the Valles Marineris, where they go suited up, hand in gloved hand, through the canyons whose walls rise above them, east of Tharsis.', 'Perhaps it is then that Haziq falls in love, a little bit, through walls and vacuum, the way a boy does, not with a real person but with an ideal, an image. Not the way he had fallen in love with his wife, not even the way he loves his children, who talk to him across the planetary gap, their words and moving images beamed to him from Earth, but they seldom do, any more, it is as if they had resigned themselves to his departure, as if by crossing the atmosphere into space he had already died and they were done with mourning.', 'It is her voice he fastens onto; almost greedily; with need. And as for Mei, it is as if she had absorbed the silence of three months and more than a hundred million kilometres, consumed it somehow, was sustained by it, her own silence with only the music for company, and now she must speak, speak only for the sake of it, like eating or breathing or making love, the first two of which she will soon do no more and the last of which is already gone, a thing of the past. And so she tells the swarm about Terminal.', 'But what is Terminal? Eliza wonders, floating in the corridors of Gateway, watching the RLVs rise into low Earth orbit, the continents shifting past, the clouds swirling, endlessly, this whole strange giant spaceship planet as it travels at 1200 kilometres an hour around the sun, while at the same time Earth, Mars, Venus, Sun and all travel at nearly 800,000 kilometres per hour around the centre of the galaxy, while ', ' this speed machine, Earth and sun and the galaxy itself move at 1000 kilometres per ', ' towards the Great Attractor, that most mysterious of gravitational enigmas, this anomaly of mass that pulls to it the Milky Way as if it were a pebble: all this and we think we’re ', ', and it makes Eliza dizzy just to think about it.', 'But she thinks of such things more and more. Space changes you, somehow. It tears you out of certainties, it makes you see your world at a distance, no longer of it but apart. It makes her sad, the old certainties washed away, and more and more she finds herself thinking of Mars; of Terminal.', 'To never see your home again; your family, your mother, your uncles, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins and second cousins and third cousins twice removed, and all the rest of them: never to walk under open skies and never to sail on a sea, never to hear the sound of frogs mating by a river or hear the whooshing sound of fruit bats in the trees. All those things and all the others you will never do, and people carry bucket lists around with them before they become Terminal, but at long last everything they ever knew and owned is gone and then there is only the jalopy confines, only that and the stars in the window and the voice of the swarm. And Eliza thinks that maybe she wouldn’t mind leaving it all behind, just for a chance at…what? Something so untenable, as will-o’-the-wisp as ideology or faith and yet as hard and precisely defined as prime numbers or fundamental constants. Perhaps it is the way Irish immigrants felt on going to America, with nothing but a vague hope that the future would be different from the past. Eliza had been to nursing school, had loved, had seen the world rotate below her; had been to space, had worked on amputations, births, tumour removals, fevers turned fatal, transfusions and malarias, has held a patient’s hand as she died or dried a boy’s tears or made a cup of tea for the bereaved, monitored IVs, changed sheets and bedpans, took blood and gave injections, and now she floats in freefall high above the world, watching the Terminals come and go, come and go, endlessly, and the string of silver jalopies extends in a great horde from Earth’s orbit to the Martian surface, and she imagines jalopies fall down like silver drops of rain, gently they glide down through the thin Martian atmosphere to land on the alien sands.', 'She pictures Terminal and listens to Mei’s voice, one amongst so many but somehow it is the voice others return to, it is as though Mei speaks for all of them, telling them of the city being built out of cheap used bruised jalopies, the way Gateway had been put together, a lot of mismatched units joined up, and she tells them, you could fall in love again, with yourself, with another, with a world.', '“Why?” Mei says to Haziq, one night period, several weeks away from planetfall. “Why did you do it?”', '“Why did I go?”', 'She waits; she likes his voice. She floats in the cabin, her mind like a calm sea. She listens to the sounds of the jalopy, the instruments and the toilet and the creaks and rustle of all the invisible things. She is taking the pills again, she must, for the pain is too great now, and the morphine, so innocent a substance to come like blood out of the vibrant red poppies, is helping. She knows she is addicted. She knows it won’t last. It makes her laugh. Everything delights her. The music is all around her now, Lao singing accompanied by a khene changing into South African kwaito becoming reggae from PNG.', '“I don’t know,” Haziq says. He sounds so vulnerable then. Mei says, “You were married.”', '“Yes.”', 'Curiosity compels her. “Why didn’t she come with you?”', '“She would never have come with me,” Haziq says, and Mei feels her heart shudder inside her like a caged bird, and she says, “But you didn’t ask.”', '“No,” Haziq says. The long silence is interrupted by others on the shared primitive radio band, hellos and groans and threats and prayers, and someone singing, drunk. “No,” Haziq says. “I didn’t ask.”', 'One month to planetfall. And Mei falls silent. Haziq tries to raise her on the radio but there is no reply. “Hello, hello, this is Haziq, C-6173, this is Haziq, C-6173, has anyone heard from Mei in A-3357, has anyone heard from Mei?”', '“This is Henrik in D-7479, I am in a great deal of pain, could somebody help me? Please, could somebody help me?”', '“This is Cobb in E-1255, I have figured it all out, there is no Mars, they lied to us, we’ll die in these tin cans, how much air, how much air is left?”', '“This is jalopy B-2031 to jalopy C-3398, queen to pawn 4, I said queen to pawn 4, and check and mate, take that, Shen, you twisted old bat!”', '“This is David in B-1201, jalopy B-1200, can you hear me, jalopy B-1200, can you hear me, I love you, Joy. Will you marry me? Will you—”', '“Yes! Yes!”', '“We might not make it. But I feel like I know you, like I’ve always known you, in my mind you are as beautiful as your words.”', '“I will see you, I will know you, there on the red sands, there on Terminal Beach, oh, David—”', '“My darling—”', '“This is jalopy C-6669, will you two get a room?” and laughter on the radio waves, and shouts of cheers, congrats, mazel tov and the like. But Mei cannot be raised, her jalopy’s silent.', 'Not jalopies but empty containers with nothing but air floating along with the swarm, destined for Terminal, supplements for the plants, and water and other supplies, and some say these settlers, if that’s what they be, are dying faster than we can replace them, but so what. They had paid for their trip. Mars is a madhouse, its inmates wander their rubbish heap town, and Mei, floating with a happy distracted mind, no longer hears even the music. And she thinks of all the things she didn’t say. Of stepping out onto Terminal Beach, of coming through the airlock, yes, but then, almost immediately, coming out again, suited uncomfortably, how hard it was, to strip the jalopies of everything inside and, worse, to go on corpse duty.', 'She does not want to tell all this to Haziq, does not want to picture him landing, and going with the others, this gruesome initiation ceremony for the newly arrived: to check on the jalopies no longer responding, the ones that didn’t open, the ones from which no one has emerged. And she hopes, without reason, that it is Haziq who finds her, no longer floating but pressed down by gravity, her fragile bones fractured and crushed; that he would know her, somehow. That he would raise her in his arms, gently, and carry her out, and lay her down on the Martian sand.', 'Then they would strip the jalopy and push it and join it to the others, this spider bite of a city sprawling out of those first crude jalopies to crash-land, and Haziq might sleep, fitfully, in the dormitory with all the others, and then, perhaps, Mei could be buried. Or left to the Martian winds.', 'She imagines the wind howling through the canyons of the Valles Marineris. Imagines the snow falling, kissing her face. Imagines the howling winds stripping her of skin and polishing her bones, imagines herself scattered at last, every tiny bit of her blown apart and spread across the planet.', 'And she imagines jalopies like meteorites coming down. Imagines the music the planet makes, if only you could hear it. And she closes her eyes and she smiles.', '“I hope it’s you…”', '“Sign here, initial here, and here, and here.”', 'The jalopyman is young and friendly, and she knows his face if not his name. He says, perhaps in surprise or in genuine interest, for they never, usually, ask, “Are you sure you want to do it?”', 'And Eliza signs, and she nods, quickly, like a bird. And she pushes the pen back at him, as if to stop from changing her mind.', '“I hope it’s you…”', '“Mei? Is that you? Is that you?”', 'But there is no one there, nothing but a scratchy echo on the radio; like the sound of desert winds.', '\\xa0', '“Terminal” copyright © 2016 by Lavie Tidhar', 'Art copyright © 2016 by Richie Pope']}\n"

      "{'Title': ['Dune Time'], 'Author': ['Jack Nicholls'], 'Body': ['Isolated in the desert with his brother, Hasan learns that there is more to the legends of the dunes than he initially believed.', '\\n', '\\n—The Holy Quran, Sura 70.4', '\\xa0', 'When he arrived, the dunes were singing.', 'It wasn’t just the wind, though there was that too, a steady whine that filled his ears with sand. But laid over that was a low-pitched vibration that rose and fell like the call of the muezzin—insistent and magnetic. It came from the west, where the crests of the orange dunes swirled. Tariq felt a long way from home.', 'Hasan was waiting for him beneath the awning of his concrete hut on the edge of the desert. He had grown his beard since Tariq had seen him last year, and thinned out beneath his white robe. He looked like an imam. Tariq’s own jeans and T-shirt were already drenched in sweat.', '“Salaam alaikum,” said Hasan, extending his arms. “Welcome, little brother.”', '“Alaikum, salaam,” replied Tariq, a little weirded out by the formality. The old Mercedes taxi, his last link to civilization, turned and began to nose its way back along the track to town.', 'Tariq crunched across the sand and into the shade of the awning. Hasan drew him into a tight embrace and they kissed four times, twice on each cheek. Then Hasan drew back and ran his hand over the racing stripes Tariq had carefully shaved above his temples.', '“Not so little anymore,” he said.', 'Tariq slapped his hand away. “It’s only been, like, six months.”', '“It goes fast at your age\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” Hasan murmured. They lapsed into uncomfortable silence. Tariq felt the sting of sand grains against his bare arms.', '“So, what do you think of your new home?” asked Hasan, with a proprietary gesture across the sand.', 'Tariq looked around. The road from town petered out here, on the shore of the Sahara. The hut was depressingly basic, though at least it had a solar panel rigged up on its roof. Two bunks within; a laptop closed on the table; an independence-era rifle hung in brackets on the wall. A hammock was strung under the awning. Beside the house, Hasan’s jeep was a ghost beneath weeks of desert dust.', 'And then there was the desert itself. Humming, impossibly orange and wind-sculpted into shapes more fantastic than anything his friends at home had ever managed with their hair. He had expected the dunes of the erg to rise slowly, but they sprang fully formed from the stony earth and filled the horizon. They looked Photoshopped. It was the strangest and most beautiful place he had ever seen.', '“It’s all right,” he conceded. “What’s that noise?”', '“The Berbers say it’s spirits, calling to each across the desert,” Hasan said. “The land is haunted by the Ghaib, the unseen.”', 'Tariq raised a withering eyebrow. Hasan held a poker face for a few moments until the old lopsided smile finally broke through. “Come on, I’ll show you the camera,” he said, picking up a plastic water bottle.', 'About a hundred meters from the house, there was a rickety metal tripod concreted into the sand. It was approximately three meters high, with a suitcase-sized black box at its apex that was reachable by a steel ladder. Facing the dunes was a dark lens behind a thin sheet of transparent plastic. Standing beneath it, Tariq could see a fishbowl reflection of his head, with the desert curving up like wings behind him.', '“That’s a Kumai X5 DSLR camera in there,” said Hasan. “Very expensive. It’s how we film the dunes moving.”', 'Tariq’s reflection looked sullen and tired after two days of bus and taxi rides. He straightened his posture and waved into the lens. “Sand doesn’t move, donkey,” he said.', '“Yes it does—very slowly, like your brain. The camera takes a photo every three hours while there’s light. Then the BBC can run them together to make a time-lapse film of the desert at noon, or sunset, or whatever.”', '“Does it have a Bluetooth connection?”', '“Yes, back to the house. We can check the photos on the laptop they gave me.”', '“So this is the big job you told us about? You watch a camera watch the desert? I can see why you needed a man of my talent. This is heavy stuff, Hasan.” As he spoke, Tariq drew his phone out to check his messages. One bar, no Internet coverage. He frowned at it, feeling the familiar tightness in his temples that came on whenever he was cut off from the world.', '“Hey!”', 'Hasan’s irritated clap was like a gunshot. “You think I needed you down here? Mum ', 'me to look after you, to get you out of the city. This is a serious job, all right? This is going to be on international TV. We’re working for Mr. ', '! And it means more money in nine months than Dad could make in five years—unless they fire me because they find out that my little brother is in trouble with the police.”', '“So you think I’m a criminal, then? I suppose the independence fighters were all criminals too? Do you care that the government is snatching people off the street and torturing them? Do you care about freedom? Do you even vote?”', 'Hasan turned to stare out across the sand, debating something with himself. Then he laughed softly. “You’re a clueless donkey.”', 'Before Tariq could retort, Hasan’s phone beeped. He glanced at it, then relaxed.', '“Prayer time,” he said, unscrewing the top of his water bottle. He poured a little into his hands and splashed himself, then offered the bottle to Tariq. He unrolled his simple tan mat and laid it on the sand, checking the angle to Mecca on a plastic compass he drew from his pocket. Hasan was always on top of that kind of detail.', 'He spread his arms and looked out toward the cobalt horizon. “Allahu Akbar,” he intoned.', '“Allahu Akbar,” Tariq repeated sulkily. The desert swallowed the ritual words, made them seem small. Hasan fell to his hands and knees and, after a self-conscious moment loitering above him, Tariq knelt and pressed his forehead to the hot sand. The sun beat down mercilessly on his back.', '“Glory to God,” Tariq whispered. The grains were hot and coarse against his nose and forehead and they stuck to his lips. With his face pressed against the sand he could feel faint vibrations, like a tiny earthquake beneath his fingers or a vast one, hundreds of miles away. The singing of the sand.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', '“Tariq.”', 'He opened his eyes. Hasan stood above him, wrapped in shadow. The air was bitterly cold.', '“What?”', '“There’s someone outside.”', 'Tariq half-rose, bunching the sheets around him. Out the window the darkness was smeared with cold stars. Hasan had taken up the rifle and moved to the doorway. All Tariq could hear was the distant desert hum, like the sound of the surf. ', '“I don’t hear\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” he began, but Hasan bolted out the door.', 'Tariq groggily fumbled out of his blankets. There was a flashlight somewhere, but he couldn’t find it, so he snatched his phone and ran outside shining its screen ahead of him like a lantern.', 'The stars overhead were disorienting in their brightness, but their light sank without a trace into black desert. Tariq strained to pinpoint his brother’s form. He directed his phone at his bare feet, terrified of scorpions emerging into the tiny circumference of blue light it gave off.', '“Come on!” shouted Hasan, chasing shadows into the dunes.', '“Wait!” called Tariq, but the wind snatched at his words and bore them away into the darkness. Moments later, he heard his own cry distantly repeated from upwind, as if his voice were spinning around him like an eddy of fluttering paper.', 'Tariq struggled after Hasan. The sand that had seemed as smooth as glass by day now flowed beneath his bare feet like a river. He dug his toes in for purchase, and beneath the crust the underlayer was still hot with yesterday’s warmth.', 'Hasan had reached the ridge of the nearest dune. Tariq could make him out now as a deeper black silhouette against the radiance of the stars. Hasan raised the rifle toward the sky, and the sound of a shot broke across the desert. Memories of tear gas and street fights flashed across Tariq’s mind and he found himself diving to the slope for protection.', 'The shock of it seemed to silence the hum of the desert for a moment, then it washed back like a wave. Tariq spat sand from his mouth and crawled up to the ridgeline, where Hasan was crouched with his head cocked intently.', '“Can you hear them?” Hasan whispered.', 'Hasan’s fear seemed to people the void before them with menacing figures, black against black beneath the vibrating stars, but Tariq could only hear the sand, the wind, and his own strained breathing. He lay against his brother, shivering in the darkness.', '“We must have scared them off,” Hasan said at last. “Probably kids trying to boost the camera.”', 'He led them to the camera tower and took Tariq’s phone to examine the equipment, pointing with satisfaction to a confusion of scuffed sand beneath the tower, although Tariq couldn’t tell if it was made up of their own tracks or someone else’s. There was no sign of damage to the camera or its case.', '“We can’t risk any tampering with the equipment,” Hasan said firmly. “We’ll have to sleep out here from now on, in shifts.”', 'Tariq wrapped his arms around himself. He was shivering, and not just from the cold—the thrum of the desert was more overwhelming at night, like helicopters patrolling the sky.', '“I am not sleeping here,” he said.', '“Then I will,” said Hasan, staring blankly into the dark. “We have to do our job.”', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'Hasan was serious about guarding the equipment. He kept his bedroll and rifle by the camera, just out of sight of its lens, and slept under the stars. He would wake with sand in his hair and nostrils and wash himself from a bucket of cloudy water before dawn prayer. In the afternoons he had taken to disappearing on long walks along the tops of the dunes. Tariq would think his brother was reading one of his ', ' magazines in the chair behind him, then be startled to see a shadow stalking along the ridgeline high above the house.', 'Tariq was struggling not to sleep through prayer times. He had built himself a nest of cushions, power cords, and water bottles in the hammock outside the door, and rarely stirred from it. He would swing in the hammock, obsessively checking his phone’s Wi-Fi like a fisherman angling for a catch that never came. The cloud was as remote and elusive in the desert as its namesakes above.', 'Some days it was so silent that he could hear the tiny shutter-click of the camera every three hours. Other times, the horizon hummed like a field of locusts. It was just vibrations from wind rolling sand grains down the slopes, Google told him, but it was unnerving, and he kept his earphones in at those times.', 'Today there was something wrong with the music on Tariq’s phone. The beats of all his songs had sped up, the singers sounded like chipmunks. He experimented with settings and playback for five minutes until he gave up and threw the phone into the sand with a curse.', 'The drone of the wind bored into his head. Hasan seemed unfazed by the sound. He sat in a sagging deck chair beside Tariq, peacefully contemplating the dunes.', '“Hasan, let’s sing. Remember when we did our own version of ‘Buffalo Soldier’? ', '”', 'He sang the verse out into the sky, then waited for Hasan to chime in on the chorus.', '“I don’t remember,” said Hasan, after a pause. “I don’t listen to music much anymore. Sorry.”', 'Tariq rolled his eyes. He picked up one of the ', 'magazines, flipped through it, flung it back down.', '“You act like an animal in a cage,” Hasan commented, without turning his head. “What happened to your love of freedom? This is as free as you have ever been. Rich Westerners pay thousands of dollars to come to the desert.”', '“It’s a desert of shit.”', 'Hasan glanced at him pityingly. “In the old days, caravans used to take fifty-two days to cross the Sahara. Without phones. Out there, it’s just you and God. The Tuareg say that the journey puts you in a trance, that you can wake up in the evening and not remember anything from the day. They call it Dune Time.”', '“This whole country’s in a trance! I should be helping my friends, not hiding down here.”', '“You should be as far away from those friends as possible. They’re not looking to make things better, they just want to be martyrs. How does throwing rocks at the police help your cause?”', '“The police broke Ali’s fingers!”', '“The police are people. Some good, some bad. They need to earn bread for their family. When was the last time you put family first?”', '“Everyone putting their own family first is the whole reason the country is messed up.”', 'Like a reclining imam, Hasan flung his arms out in mock admonishment, “Be maintainers of justice, bearers of witness for God, though it may be against your own selves, your parents, or your relatives.”', '“There you go, then,” said Tariq. “It’s clear.”', '“So clear, so clear.” Hasan repeated, drumming his fingers on his knees. Then, abruptly—“Did you know that Dad had a visit from the police last month? They threatened to close his business down if he didn’t pull you into line.”', 'The wind hissed between them for long moments. At last Tariq said, “Why didn’t he tell me that?”', '“I’m telling you now.”', 'Tariq turned away, onto his side. “Well, I’m sorry I’m such a disappointment to you all,” he said bitterly.', 'Hasan sighed. “You’re not a disappointment, Tariq. Why do you think Dad didn’t say anything? We’re all proud of you. You just need to gain some perspective.”', 'Tariq held his silence.', '“Things will get better,” Hasan went on. “We just need to show the world we’re responsible, that we can do the same jobs as Westerners and the Chinese. The government will adapt to keep the investment flowing. Trust in God.”', '“And just hope that happens before we die of old age?”', '“Inshallah,” said Hasan.', 'His family’s favorite way to shut down a difficult conversation. Tariq gave his hammock a few passive-aggressive swings and watched a ball of dead grass blow up against the dune and roll back again.', 'The sun glinted on the casing of his phone, taunting him. He retrieved it and blew the sand from its screen. This time it showed the elusive one-bar signal.', 'Hasan forgotten, Tariq started circling the house, waving his arms in the air. The bar came and went. Desperate, he put his foot up on the window ledge and chased the signal onto the blistering concrete of the roof. And there, wedged beneath the solar panel for shade, he could finally reach the life-giving waters of the information sea.', 'Tariq felt the tension ease from his shoulders as his browser loaded. While the signal lasted, he opened as many tabs as he could. He checked Al-Jazeera and the BBC. There had been more unrest since he’d gone into exile, and the government had backed down on its proposed curfew law. His friends’ Twitter feeds were exultant. He should be there.', 'A pop-up blinked at him. Freedom21 had come online. Ali. Tariq eagerly called him and leaned in toward the screen.', 'Ali’s image appeared, pixelated and bleached of its normal color. He squinted at his screen uncertainly for a moment, then relaxed into a grin.', '“Hey, the Bedouin is back! How’s the desert?”', 'There was a bad lag in the visual, giving a creepy de-synchronization effect. When Ali’s voice did come through it sounded hollow and far away, like he was at the bottom of a well.', '“It’s as exciting as watching my fingernails grow. What’s happening there?”', 'Ali spread his hands—', '“We need you, man! The walls are crumbling, but there’re rumors that the army is going to come back in. Fucking pigs. We need men on the street!”', 'According to Ali, the walls had been crumbling for three years now. Tariq could see a mound of comic books piled behind him on his bed. “I can’t, I’ve got to stay low,” he said.', '“Because of that warrant? Don’t worry about it; we’ll hide you in the medina. And remember, ‘Under a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.’”', '“It’s not that, brother.”', '“Then what?”', '“The police threatened my parents. If I got in trouble again.”', 'Ali shrugged. “Sorry, man. But it just goes to show that we have to keep going, you know? This is ', ', Tariq', '”', '“So’s my family!”', 'The pixelated Ali looked taken aback. Tariq paused, embarrassed at the way his voice had boomed across the emptiness. He glanced down, but Hasan sat with his hands behind his head and showed no signs of having heard.', '“Shit, man, of course they are. Sorry.”', '“I’m sorry too. Can you tell me more about what’s happening?”', 'He saw Ali rub his chin doubtfully and glance at something offscreen. “I don’t know, man, it’s been crazy. Things are moving so fast. Look, I have to go; we’ve got a strategy meeting soon. I’ll let everyone know you’re doing good, eh? Salaam, brother.”', '“Salaam,” murmured Tariq. Ali switched off the connection and his image withdrew five hundred miles to the north.', 'Tariq sat back glumly and let the heat soak through his shirt. From up here he could see long fingers of sand reaching out from the dunes toward the distant road. Someone had erected little palm leaf fences to slow the desert’s advance, but they were already half-buried. There were a few tooth-like clouds in the sky now, drifting aimlessly out into the erg.', 'With a pang of conscience, Tariq tapped out a short email to his family: ', ', etc. Then he halfheartedly browsed for another hour until the Internet stuttered out, and he became aware of just how dehydrated he was becoming. He rolled to the edge of the roof and lowered his head below the awning.', 'Hasan was kneeling at his prayer mat again, bowing to the western dunes. Tariq hopped down beside him.', '“Miss me?”', 'There was no response for a moment, then Hasan turned his head slowly and looked up at him, squinting against the glare.', '“What do you mean?” he asked.', '“I’ve just been on the roof for two hours,” Tariq said. “Where did you think I’d been?”', '“I didn’t notice.”', '“Sure,” said Tariq. “You know, Mecca is that way,” he added, pointing east. Hasan blinked up at the sky, then shifted his prayer mat around.', '“You know, if I have to be here, I can at least help maintain the camera.” Tariq said. “You’re crap at the tech stuff anyway.”', 'Hasan nodded vaguely, not really listening.', '“You’re sandcracked,” Tariq told him, and retreated to the hammock to await the coming of another night.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'The weeks stretched out interminably as the days bled into each other. Tariq learned to distinguish the hiss of a sand eddy from the scrape of grains rustling through the thorns of the acacia trees. He took to dozing in the afternoon heat and staying up into the cool night, illuminated by the blue glow of the laptop as he clicked back and forth through the photos of the dunes.', 'There were enough photos that Tariq could run about ten seconds of film now; the pockmarked sand hills undulating across the screen like a caravan of ghosts. In the foreground the desert surface bulged and rippled like muscle flexing beneath skin. It gave him chills.', 'The photos were designed to be grouped in their respective time blocks for morning, noon, or afternoon footage, but he preferred to run them all together so that the alternating lines of shadow flickered back and forth like strobe lighting. He looped them to songs, obsessively updating the makeshift music videos every few days to add in the latest footage.', 'On nights when the hypnotic film had lulled him into a half-sleep, Tariq often thought he saw Hasan pacing the crest of the dunes in the moonlight. Those moments, detached from the time around them, flowed seamlessly into dreams of home. Dreams of his family, of girls, of the terror and exultation of the square. Or worse. He walked through an endless nighttime desert like the bottom of a vast deep sea; the dunes frozen waves poised to crash over him and drive him down among the creatures swimming the depths below. Above him the stars whined like feedback from a broken speaker.', 'Tariq woke with a start into choking heat, his skin prickly and goose-pimpled, as if his body didn’t know if it was cold or hot. A tinny rendition of a dated pop hit was sounding out across the sand; Hasan’s ringtone. His brother was prostrate in the heat a few meters away, head bowed toward the dunes.', '“Hasan. Your phone.”', 'Hasan remained deep in prayer. ', ', moaned the stupid ringtone.', 'Tariq heaved himself out of his nest and ran across the sand, nudging Hasan in the backside. “Hasan!”', 'No reply. Tariq could hear him whispering something to the ground. The phone began its kitschy little loop again, and Tariq fished it out of his brother’s sun-bleached robe. The caller ID read ', ' ', '. Shit. He answered.', '“Hello, Hasan?” came a man’s voice speaking English. Young, confident, impatient.', '“No, this is Tariq\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. I’m his brother. I am assisting on the project.”', 'There was a doubtful silence from Michael BBC. Tariq clamped a hand over his free ear to block the whistling of the wind and tried to think of what he could say next to prove his professionalism. “I do the IT work,” he hazarded.', '“Is Hasan there?”', 'Tariq covered the mouthpiece and crouched by his brother. “Hasan!” he hissed, giving him a savage poke in the ribs. Hasan straightened slowly and gave him a blank, sleepwalker’s stare. There was sand encrusted on his cheek.', 'Tariq straightened again and said, “Hasan is on-site, examining the equipment. We’re getting some lovely shots here. Panoramic views.”', '“Panoramic?”', '“Very panoramic,” Tariq emphasized, walking back to the house. “We don’t have much Internet out here, but I’d be happy to bring them into town and email you the pictures. Or to Mr. Attenborough—is he there with you?”', 'The voice was amused. “No, Mr. Attenborough is in London. Yeah, if you could get Hasan to send some footage my way, that would be great. No other problems at your end? You don’t need more crew?”', 'Tariq glanced back at Hasan, who was whispering something to the horizon. “Uh, no. Thank you. Things are tip-top.Tip. Top.”', '“All right, great. Tell Hasan that I’m not going to be able to swing by as planned, but we’ll try to schedule something for next month. Cheers, mate.”', '“Cheers,” said Tariq rotely. The phone went dead, and he wiped the sweat from his forehead. After his panic subsided he felt a surge of fury at his brother. He grabbed a water bottle and strode back outside. Hasan was sitting cross-legged on the mat, eyes unfocused.', '“What’s wrong with you, donkey?” demanded Tariq, handing his brother the water. “You leave me to do the business? You want them to think we’re amateurs? That you’ve brought your family down to squat here?”', 'Hasan rubbed his faced and took a slow gulp. “I was praying, Tariq. Something you should do a bit more of.”', '“Praying?” Tariq glanced at his phone. “It’s 3 p.m.!”', '“There are some things more important than money,” Hasan said dully, staring out at the horizon. “Can’t you feel God’s presence here?”', '“Weren’t you the one who told me we needed this job? Hasan? Hasan!”', 'Hasan didn’t answer.', '“I don’t think you should sleep out here anymore,” Tariq said. He looked at the sun. It balanced on the distant line of dunes, poised to roll away into night. “I don’t think either of us should.”', 'After a lengthy pause, Hasan said slowly, “Thank you, Tariq. I’ll come back inside soon.”', '\\xa0', '***', 'BANG.', 'The cursor flickered.', 'His lips were dry. So dry. The roof of his mouth felt scoured and ribbed. When he breathed the inside of his throat shrank from the hot air.', 'Forcing numb legs into action, Tariq staggered to their stash of water bottles. He drained one, opened another and sipped it. How long had he slept? His phone was dead, but outside the sun was only just past its height.', 'BANG. BANG.', 'It was the screen door, swinging on its hinges in the wind. A dented line in the paintwork marked where the frame was hitting the table. Long fingers of sand reached across the step, brushing against Tariq’s sneakers. On the table, the pages of Hasan’s Quran ruffled back and forth.', 'BANG.', 'Tariq stepped gingerly outside, fumbling in his pocket for his sunglasses. He pulled the door shut behind him, scraping a wave of sand back onto the porch. More sand weighed down the wipers of the jeep.', '“Hasan?”', 'The camera tower shimmered in the distant heat. Tariq jogged over to it and looked for a sign of his brother. He found something half-buried in the sand and nudged it with his foot—it was Hasan’s phone. There were no footprints and if there had been the dancing grains would have obliterated them in minutes. The dunes swirled and hummed.', 'The camera lens reflected his own frightened image back at him. In the reflection of his sunglasses was a miniature image of the camera again reflecting him reflecting it, tumbling down through eternity.', 'Tariq shouted Hasan’s name until he was hoarse, but the wind whipped his cries away. His nerve broke and he turned to run back to the hut, childishly terrified to peer back over his shoulder.', 'Back in the hut he felt dizzy. He had to lean against the table to steady himself. He couldn’t call the police; he was on their hit list. And how did he even know how long Hasan had been gone?', 'The BBC camera. The photos were time-stamped. Thankfully, the laptop was still plugged in and charged. Tariq blew the sand from its keyboard and opened the photo folder.', 'He clicked incredulously through the series. He’d fallen asleep on the evening of the 11th. There were eight photos since then, the latest stamped for midday on the 13th. He’d been unconscious for forty hours.', 'But he’d found Hasan.Twelfth September, nine a.m. Hasan was kneeling on his prayer mat, looking out across the erg. His arms were raised in supplication; he teetered as if the camera had caught him at the moment of falling into his own shadow.', 'Three hours on, the shot was almost identical. Hasan was still frozen in exactly the same position. But his shadow had pooled around him now and he was shrunken, a dwarf.', 'Tariq cupped his face in his hands, breathed deeply, then looked again. Hasan wasn’t smaller, he had just receded from the lens—he had moved into the background. There were no tracks in the sand behind him.', 'Six p.m. Now Hasan knelt on the lip of a background dune, a tiny shadow against the setting sun. His silhouetted arms still flung wide as the desert sucked him outward.', 'That was it until this morning, a gap of twelve hours. The desert in the photo was empty. Tariq had to magnify the image to its maximum to find what he was looking for—a tiny, bright cross in the distance. Hasan, swept far out across the sand sea.', 'The most recent photo showed only the dunes.', '“There is no god but God,” Tariq whispered, and began to cry.', 'He pressed the arrow keys back and forth, scrolling hopelessly through the few frames. Hasan had been lost for more than a day. He could already be dead from dehydration.', 'They had no printer. There were no features in the photos from which to take a bearing except the curves of the sand, and Tariq wasn’t going to put any trust in that. He could only make the most general estimate as to which direction Hasan had vanished.', 'He opened the desk drawer and rifled through old food wrappers and loose playing cards until he found Hasan’s compass. He pocketed it, snatched the rifle, and ran back to the tower.', 'In approximately the spot where the first image of Hasan had been visible, facing the dunes, Tariq laid the compass on the swirling sand. The needle spun idly once or twice and he felt a fresh surge of nausea. But at last it settled on north.', 'Sweat trickling down his temples and sides, Tariq dragged the butt of the rifle in a wide arc where it would be visible from the camera’s nest. Once the line was distinct, consulting the compass, he carefully crossed it with dozens of lines radiating out at all angles to the west. Beneath each line he marked its bearing. 255 degrees. 260 degrees. 265 degrees.', 'The heat and exhaustion dried his tears and his breath was ragged by the time he was done. When he was satisfied that the marks were clear, Tariq sprang up the ladder to the camera aerie and opened its case. Then, with his finger on the button, he manually photographed the scene.', 'The wind chased him back to the house, lashing sand across the back of his calves. Back at the computer desk, he refreshed the folder and opened the new file. It had worked—he had an identically positioned photo of the erg, but with rough compass bearings like a child’s writing scratched into the foreground.', 'Now, at least, Tariq was in control. He opened Photoshop and layered the frames of Hasan on top of each other, with the compass shot uppermost. A few tweaks of the fade and transparency settings gave him an eerie multiple exposure of four Hasans, shrinking like babushka dolls toward the horizon. He dragged a red line through them. They aligned perfectly, and he had his bearing: 266 degrees.', 'Water. Hasan would need water. Tariq filled a backpack with bottles, wrapped a scarf around his head, and froze. Something had changed while he’d been working.', 'It was the silence. The door hung still, the wind dropped.', 'He crept out into the bleached landscape. The sand was pristine again, his compass lines vanished.', 'He stalled the jeep in under thirty seconds, its wheels spinning uselessly against the slope. There was no hope of getting it over the dunes. Compass and rifle in hand, the water bottles bouncing against his shoulders, he chased the sun into the desert.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'The stillness was absolute. Not a grain of sand stirred across the erg, and the whispers of Tariq’s footsteps floated up into the azure sky as he threaded his way between the great dunes.', 'Coming to rest in the shadow of a long, low hill, Tariq heard the tiny clicks of individual sand grains rolling against each other. A lone scarab beetle was marching lengthwise along the dune. Its wavering six-footed track extended as far along the sand as he could see. Tariq watched it pass and then lifted his gaze to the wall of sand towering above him. He had to climb it. He’d never be able to find Hasan without a proper vantage point.', 'He climbed slowly, leaning on the rifle for support. The crust held firm under the compression of his tread, then collapsed into shallow holes as he lifted his foot away. He wanted to run, but as soon as he tried his legs sank up to the ankle, so he toiled step by slow step. His thighs burned and his sneakers grew heavy with sand. He was still just in view of the camera, and he imagined himself as it saw him, a scarab-sized speck inching up an orange wall.', 'At last he reached the knife-like rim. It disintegrated as he grasped it, running like liquid gold between his fingers. From here he could see that the dune was a crescent, its arms reaching out ahead of him to the desert. Its moon shape repeated itself endlessly to the horizon. Unchanging.', 'Tariq closed his eyes, willed himself to remember his schooling. “And He withholds not a knowledge of the unseen,” he whispered. He looked again to the west.', 'Far away, a few solitary pixels of white against the yellow. A flaw in the image. Hasan.', 'Tariq sat like a child on the corrugated ridgeline and pushed off with his hands, sliding diagonally downward in a shower of sand. Around him, a whole sheet detached from the dune. The cascade of grains sang him down its slope and moments later the nightmare hum echoed back to him from the surrounding ridges.', 'The sound cocooned him. Like the picture of the impossible staircase, it climbed and climbed in intensity without ever changing. Or were there patterns there, but too slow for him to notice? Even as he thought it the pitch seemed to rise—a hysterical sustained whine that blanked his mind and pulled him onward.', 'The next line of dunes was far, and then it was close. The rifle was a heavy burden on his shoulder, then it was a distant mark in the sand behind him. His big brother was lost, and then Tariq was beside him.', 'Like an ancient statue, Hasan knelt half-buried in sand, head bowed across outstretched arms. His skin was blistered from sunburn. Sand had piled in waves around him, sucked down his legs, submerged his fingers. Only his face was free, breathing into the hollow made between his arms.', '“Hasan!” Tariq grabbed his brother by the shirt and hauled. The material tore like paper, but he managed to heave Hasan’s head up. His beard glinted with crystalline grains.', 'Tariq forced Hasan’s mouth open, splitting his cracked lips. He jammed a water bottle into his brother’s mouth and poured until Hasan choked and spluttered it back onto the sand. The moisture instantly vanished between the grains. He looked up at Tariq, recognition flaring in his bloodshot eyes.', '“It’s not God,” he croaked.', '“We’re going home,” Tariq told his brother, lifting him to his feet. “Lean on me.”', 'Climbing the dunes by himself had been bad. Trying to walk with Hasan’s weight on him was almost impossible. Once he reached the first slope, each step plunged his legs calf-deep into shifting sand; it was like trying to crawl the wrong way up an escalator. He climbed in a dream. He moved in Dune Time.', 'His shadow wavered, then began to elongate in front of him. It stretched out, staining the sand like a stream finding its bed. Afraid to watch it, Tariq turned his gaze away, and behind him saw the sun fall to the horizon like a stone.', '“So verily, I swear by the planets that recede, by the planets that move swiftly and hide themselves, and by the night as it departs and by the dawn as it brightens.” Hasan whispered hoarsely.', '“Shut up!” groaned Tariq, trying to quicken his pace up the crumbling slope. But above him the cold sky darkened, and moments later the stars burst out in their full radiance, the dunes around him now only visible by the void they cut in the starlight.', 'Tariq grew disorientated. Beneath his thin cotton T-shirt, he felt like he’d been doused in ice water. His mouth felt full of glass, and his skin was raw from the scouring of the sand. Sinking to his knees, he couldn’t stop himself from draining another full water bottle while ahead of him the sky lightened again. The gap in the dunes he’d been aiming at was gone—the sand had closed around them in the night.', 'Hasan stirred against him, and turned his head to look behind. “They are moving,” he whispered. “The Ghaib. The smokeless fire. The djinn.” He gave a gasp. “They’re beautiful.”', 'Tariq turned.', 'They swam through the sand like ripples through a lake. Faces boiled from the dunes, and sand ran from their sockets as they turned their gazes to the seven heavens.', '“Don’t look,” Tariq begged, hauling them forward another step. The horizon flickered and the dunes shrieked. He fumbled in his backpack for the last water bottle, and his hands closed around something small and hard. His phone. Sanity.', 'With shaking fingers, he drew it out. It still had a charge in it. He spun the selection wheel on his favorites and pressed play on “Buffalo Soldier.”', 'There was a burst of white noise in his ear, and then the song select screen appeared again. The battery had dropped to half full. His shadow was slithering toward him as the air heated again.', '“No, no,” groaned Tariq. He selected the song again and closed his eyes. Strained to listen to the patterns. The same few seconds of squealing—this time he discerned a loose pattern to the intensity of the sound. Rise-fall-rise-fall. Verses and choruses.', 'Restart. Select. Play it again. Tariq kept struggling up the hill. Hasan had fallen back into semi-consciousness.', 'There was so much life in the world! In the streets of the cities and the banter of chat rooms, in Coca-Cola and kefta, in music and television. Human time.', 'Restart. He sang as fast as he could, running the syllables together, dropping consonants, just trying to keep up. As soon as he reached the end he gasped and looped back to the beginning. Focus on the words, hear the gaps between the words, stretch it out.', 'The sun stopped its precipitous rise. The buzz of the dunes fell back toward its normal register.', 'Then the screen of his phone went dark. And like a roller coaster which had crested its peak, the sun began to accelerate back down toward the sand.', '“No\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. please,” Tariq sobbed, tapping uselessly at its screen. The surface of the desert sucked at his blistered feet. The song was slipping away.', '“Old camel herdman\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. sand in his turban\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.”', 'It was Hasan. Eyes closed, voice croaky. He pushed Tariq forward up the dune.', 'Tariq picked it back up: “There was an old camel herdman\\xa0. .\\xa0. walking through the Sa-ha-ra.”', '“He gettin’ so thirst-ee\\xa0. .\\xa0.”', '“.\\xa0.\\xa0. He drinkin’ his own pee!”', 'They sang together now, stepping in time, focused on their breathing and the beat.', 'It was working. The sun slowed\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0. was still. And then Tariq’s foot crested the dune and he could see the camera tower on the horizon. Keeping their eyes fixed on it, still singing, they staggered home.', '\\xa0', '***', '\\xa0', 'The car’s engine could be heard for long minutes before Michael BBC appeared out of the haze. Tariq and Hasan stood formally among their wind chimes and loudspeakers, ready to receive him to the bunkhouse. A pot of mint tea steamed on the table, and the sand had been swept well back from the door.', 'The car was a little Renault, not really suited to the rutted road. When he sprang out of it, Michael BBC turned out to be tanned, fit, with a balding head wrapped in a scarf. He grinned at them and clasped his hands together for a friendly ', '.', '“Hasan. And Tariq? Mike. Good to meet you. Lovely country here, isn’t it? What a drive. Sorry it’s taken me so long to get down, the visa was a little rough with everything that’s going on. Wow, you guys have really kitted this place out, haven’t you?”', 'Mike glanced at the wind chimes, the rows of cheap plastic clocks, and at the Quranic verses Hasan had nailed to the doorposts. Months of spiritual fortifications.', '“It’s cultural,” said Tariq.', 'Mike nodded understandingly. Of course.', 'They went inside, poured the mint tea in long cascades, made small talk about the documentary. It was strange to hear another voice after so long. When the cups were down to their dregs, Mike glanced meaningfully at the laptop on the table and asked if they could have a look at the completed footage.', 'Hasan excused himself for a cigarette, leaving Tariq to load up the computer. A gust of hot wind outside set the wind chimes jangling atonally, fragmenting the sounds from outside.', 'They had about thirty seconds of stop-motion footage for each time block. Tariq selected the noon batch and set it running, watching the Englishman’s face rather than the now-familiar imagery.', '“Beautiful,” Mike murmured, the flickering screen reflected in pupils. “Such bizarre patterns. We’ll get a bloody BAFTA for this. You two will be credited, of course. Assistant cinematographers.”', 'Tariq did not respond. If the Englishman could not see them, he wouldn’t point them out. He wondered what would happen when the footage screened on TV.', 'Mike copied the photos onto three thumb drives before pronouncing himself satisfied. “I guess you’ll be off now, too,” he said. “Or have you decided to make a go of it here?”', 'Hasan laughed hollowly from the porch.', '“We’re going into business together back home,” said Tariq. “At the moment everyone is divided: young and old, cities and regions, traditional and modern. Everybody argues, and everybody only hears what they want to hear. We’re going to set something up so all those people can hear each other’s voices.”', '“Like a radio show?”', '“Or a website, or a newsletter. Somewhere people can speak about what kind of country we want, loudly enough that the government can’t ignore it.”', '“You sure you want to get mixed up in that? I could talk to the bosses about immigration visas if you’d rather be out of it.”', '“We’re not running away. Even if we can only change things little by little, the country will move eventually.”', '“One grain at a time,” suggested Hasan from outside.', 'The Englishman nodded his understanding. “Best of luck with it. Seriously, if there’s anything I can do\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.” He stood and made his apologies. He had a plane to catch, needed to be home. Within minutes his dust trail was dissipating over the horizon.', '“Come on then,” said Hasan. “Let’s go.”', '“Coming,” said Tariq. He clicked the video one more time.', 'Once you knew what you were looking for, you couldn’t miss them. Blank-eyed faces emerging and receding, the stirring of hands in glacially slow waves. He watched the djinn make their unhurried pilgrimage through the sand.', '“Where do you think they’re going?” he asked.', '“I don’t know,” said Hasan, taking his hand, “but I suppose they’ll get there in the end.”', '\\xa0', '\\xa0', '“Dune Time” copyright © 2016 by Jack Nicholls', 'Art copyright © 2016 by Mark Smith', '\\xa0']}\n"

The test subject? Her own daughter. A mother-daughter mad scientist story, “The Destroyer” asks how far we’ll go to secure our own legacies — and how far we’ll run to escape them.', '\\xa0', 'Long before my mother destroyed the world, her experiments were quieter, more contained. They did not obliterate continents. They did not rack up the dead.', 'She began as a domestic researcher in the household of an Umbrian merchant, engineering fish with mirrored scales. She told me how he loved to see his own face reflected, one and then a thousand and then another hundred times; how he filled the fountains with so many that there was no room to breathe or swim; how she woke up one morning to find that they had devoured one another, and left the fountains overflowing with blood.', 'He did not recognize her genius. For him she was only a carnival magician: a maker of flower stems that shattered like glass, and three-headed dogs, and the many-faced prisms that years later gave me nightmares of mirrors that did not end. Women’s work, he said. Not science.', 'So she moved on. She spent five years in Friuli, making nuclear lamps that waxed and waned with the moon, and another three in Milan, where she throttled sunflowers until they bore fruit. She sold the formula to a senator’s wife, and in six months’ time the whole Republic stank of them: of that peculiar mixture of honey and raw meat that I associate with her even now.', '“All idiots,” she told me once. “They’d have slurped slop from a trough if they thought I’d invented it.”', 'She worked for provincial governors, for senators; she sold drugs to generals that lured soldiers into the fata morganas of the sands; she provided one of Caesar’s chief ministers with a device that would allow him to press his ear against a cube made of glass, and through it listen to his enemies’ dreams.', '“They didn’t understand,” she used to tell me as she tightened the bolts in my shoulder. “They patted me on the head, slipped me some money. They thanked me and went on their way—and didn’t even think to tell Caesar what I’d done. But I showed them, didn’t I?”', 'In me she found an outlet for her genius. Into me she’d poured all her knowledge, molten with need; she had taken cells from her ribs and fiddled with them under a microscope; five months later, gelatinous and gasping for breath, I was. It made the papers—I was the first parthenogenesis, the daughter without a father, the flesh of my mother’s flesh. I was proof of her greatness.', 'From the beginning, I was taller than she was.', 'For the first six months there were papal picketers outside our laboratory, demanding that I be drowned, and old women in the marketplace swore that when my mother passed them by, they developed boils on the soles of their feet.', '“Of course, they all wanted to know how I’d done it,” my mother said to me. “But I never told them. You’re mine—and only mine. Nobody else knows how to make you.” She used to cradle me against her breasts; it calmed me long enough for her to clean the copper at my wrist.', 'Within three months she had been offered a state position in one of Caesar’s laboratories on the outskirts of the city.', '“It took us five years,” she said. “But he noticed me at last. You see what you’ve done?” She kissed me on the forehead. “You are my greatness. And I love you for it.”', 'So she loved me. On Saturdays she took me to the Hippodrome; she sat in the umbrella shade and watched me as I chased eagles and got mud on my shoelaces. Her suit was blue and her hair was long and light behind her, and when her gaze enveloped me, I knew there was no other woman in the world.', 'My eyes were her eyes. My lips were her lips and my shoulders, too, were hers, and so the world was geometrically composed, and everything I ever was or would become was threaded in me already, and manifest in her.', 'One day she took me to lunch at the senatorial haunt on the Capitoline, where the names of Caesar’s chief scientists were inscribed upon the ministry gates. We sat together in silence, staring at our unfilled plates, and watched the servants scurry as they ferried platters into the back room.', '“Caesar’s in there, I suppose,” my mother said. “They’re always so nervy when he’s around.” She fingered the rose the waiters had left on the table for us, divesting it of thorns.', '“They want to impress me,” she said to me. “They must know who I am.” She considered it. “They think they can impress me with this?” Her laugh was hollow and cruel. “It doesn’t interest me. Just think if each petal were a different color—how much better it would be, then. One lime colored, one magenta, one orange, one black.” She tore them off and pressed them into my hands, and my fingers grew sticky and sickly with the smell. “Get these out of my sight.”', 'That night I crept out of my bedroom and made my way to the garden of our courtyard, and there I uprooted every stem and set them all on fire before the statues of the household gods. My mother found me in the morning, smeared in ash; she said nothing but made us breakfast and spooned extra honey onto my plate.', 'On Sundays we went to the Forum. We sat together on the pillars; she spread cheese on bread and commanded me to play. I clambered over the columns, tripping in the enormity of the spaces between them. We played hide-and-seek around the arches of the Colosseum; she always found me, and there gathered me in her arms.', 'The tourists did not disturb us; Caesar’s guards did not disturb us. Nobody existed there but the two of us, who were really one. In our happiness everything outside us, everything alien to our secrets, was blotted out—or else I do not remember it.', 'When I was thirteen my mother developed an artificial arm. It was opal-pale and gleamed; it could bend without breaking. It could lift four or five hundred kilograms without effort; knives slashed forth from a slit in the palms on command.', '“For protection,” my mother said. She took my hand in hers and pressed the palm to her lips. “I was never so strong, you know,” she said. “My arms were never beautiful. They were freckled.” She turned my hand over, feeling her way through my knuckles. “Yours will be too, in this heat. You’ll have to wear sleeves like mine.” I let her run her fingers through my hair. “You’re so lovely,” she said. “When I was fourteen, maybe I was so lovely too. I don’t remember. It was a long time ago, and I try not to think about it much. But there’s so much I want to give you. If you wanted. Only if you wanted.”', 'I could see no fault in her, nor any ugliness, though I stood naked all night in front of the mirror, looking at my arm from every angle, pressing it up against my ribs to spread the fat like soft cheese across my side. I kneaded the flesh and picked at the skin and in the morning I asked her to give me the arm she had made.', 'She kissed me. “I knew you would understand,” she said.', 'The operation went quickly. I felt nothing, but through the haze I remember that I heard her singing, a song in the vulgar tongue that was spoken only in the provinces, which she must have known as a girl.', 'When I woke, she was holding a hand that now belonged to me—though I did not feel it—and stroking my forehead with the back of her hand.', '“You’re so lovely,” she said, and took me in her arms.', 'She taught me how to use it: how to hoist myself up single-handed on bars of steel, how to throw javelins made of osmium and catch discs weighted down with lead. She watched as I grew coltish and strong, as I shook out my hair and my cheeks flushed pink with intoxicating strength; she watched me and took photographs, measurements, and hung these on her laboratory walls.', 'She sent Caesar a diagram of the arm. Two weeks later he replied—on official letterhead, with the eagle on the seal—to congratulate her.', '“You see what we’ve accomplished?” She framed it on the wall.', 'When I was fifteen, she created an artificial leg.', '“You’re so intelligent,” she said. “And I’m so proud of you. There’s so much you ', ' do, if you only cared a little more about yourself. If you were only willing to put in the time.”', 'I came to her that night and asked her to build me one. It was long and slim, turned up at the heel and impervious to pain.', 'It proved too long—the false foot dragged a few millimeters behind the real one—and so we amputated the other. I grew two inches overnight and found I was taller than she was.', 'My mother supervised my rehabilitation. She took me daily to the Forum, where now I could leap and somersault over the ruins, and challenged me to run faster, to climb to the top of Trajan’s Column, to jump from the three-story Triumphal Arch without wincing in pain.', 'My mother filmed it all and sent the footage to Caesar.', 'This time his answer was handwritten. He thanked my mother for her service and invited us both to a reception on the Capitoline the following Kalends.', 'My mother put her hands on the sides of my face; she tightened at my screws until I yelped; she checked the circuits at my shoulder and polished the metal eagle branded into my forearm.', '“Don’t fidget.” She slapped my left wrist, which was the only one capable of feeling pain. She considered my neck, my breasts, my waist. “It’s only . . .” She passed her fingers over my eyelids. “They’re brown, like mine. You could fix them, you know. If you wanted to.”', 'I told her I didn’t want to. My eyes were her eyes; for her sake I loved them.', '“But you can barely see!” She pulled them open with her fingertips. “You could see perfectly, more than that—we could put a camera in, another lens or two, so you could see things up close . . .”', 'There was nothing noble about my refusal. I was afraid of the pain.', '“Whatever you want,” she said. “It’s none of my business. But when Caesar sees you, don’t blame me if he isn’t impressed with us. He doesn’t invite just anybody to these things, you know.”', 'It wasn’t easy to get an invitation. Caesar didn’t ask people twice. She’d worked so hard—she’d been so proud of me, of my strength, of my speed, of the swannish way I could dance, balancing my whole weight upon a single metallic toe. She only wanted Caesar to see, in his majesty, what she saw already, and what I refused to see.', 'She gave me two blue eyes to replace the ones she had taken out.', 'That night I danced with Caesar. He slid his hand up the side of my thigh; I did not feel it. I let him take me to one of the back chambers, and there I let him open the various panels on my legs, on my forearm, in my back. I showed him where my mother had fused wires together, and where they snaked into veins. He asked me to show him my strength.', 'The next day a member of the senatorial science council was found poisoned, and Caesar offered my mother his place. The following month she improved upon my spine.', 'There was only one part of me my mother refused to operate upon. She would not risk my ability to bear children. “It is the greatest thing I have ever done,” she said to me. “It is the only way I know I am truly alive, knowing that I will live on in you. It means that I will never die.”', 'In the end it didn’t matter. When I was sixteen, one of her refurbishments resulted in infection, and to save my life it became necessary to remove my womb.', '“Never mind,” my mother said then. “I’ll build you a better one tomorrow.”', '\\xa0', 'When I was seventeen Caesar’s chief scientist died; my mother replaced him. We moved to the official residence: a glass-fronted monolith just outside the city walls. From the top floor we could make out the old city in the distance—the Colosseum, the Triumphal Arch, Trajan’s Column—swarming with tramcars. With my new eyes I could even make out the stray cats.', '“It’s happened at last,” my mother said. “This is what we’ve been working toward. They know now what we can do.” She considered me. “You’ve gotten so beautiful, you know.”', 'I was not beautiful; nevertheless, I commanded attention. Men stared at my legs in the street, marveling at their symmetry, sometimes suspecting. There were rumors among the political classes—whispers of senator’s wives with false hands or bionic ankles, minor modifications among the Praetorian Guard—but the totality of my replacements was unheard of, even here. My appearance in the marketplace prompted whispers, dark looks, greengrocers crossing themselves and lighting candles to the saints. By now my mother had replaced every part of me, with the exception of my left arm.', 'This, I had informed her, would remain precisely as it was.', 'My mother and I still took our walks around the Capitoline, where men bowed to us when we passed them by. My mother’s name was inscribed upon the ministry walls, now, for services rendered to Caesar; she liked to go there each morning at breakfast time, to make sure that it was still there.', '“All fools,” she said. “The whole lot of them.”', '“Except you.”', '“I’ve done so much, now. I’ve been cleverer than they were. The others: they made toys, children’s games. I made things for ', 'And, you see? Now they know. It was the least they could do for me, given all that I do for him.”', 'She wrapped her arms around me and kissed my forehead, and in the warmth of her, nothing else existed. There was only that double strand of our being, our arms twining into one another. There was only her face in my face, her voice in my voice, and so she did not realize that I was lying to her.', 'It was a lie of omission. I had taken to wearing a shawl, as peasant women did, to cover the falsity of my face, and in that anonymity I had begun to wander the insalubrious alleyways of the city, like the palm readers and chicken sellers, uniformly made of flesh. There I walked for hours, in the fruitless hope of blistering my feet, of starting to smell. Alone I went across the river into Trastevere, and there I wandered anonymous in the back alleys of the marketplace.', 'One day I went, head covered, to the fishmonger on the riverbank; he pressed live squid into my hands and commanded me to feel their freshness; I squelched the tentacles between my fingers and marveled at how easily I crushed them.', 'I took my left hand out of its glove and carried it bare-handed to the bridge; there I tore at it with my teeth; there I swallowed it raw. I spit the ink out into the river and thrilled at my transgression.', 'I had even taken to going to church. I wasn’t sure if I believed, but my mother set no store by it, and so I took perverse pleasure in listening to the old rites, in the incense that clung to my clothes. I never took a cushion for my knees when I knelt to pray—I did not need one—but the old women of the congregation took this for penance, and thought me the most pious of them all.', 'I lit candles for my mother, and left them burning. I took communion, and sanctified whatever parts of me could still be sanctified—five of my fingers, the wrist of my left arm. In those moments, I used to imagine that I was transfigured and that my body was neither mechanical nor flesh, but something ethereal and else, some yet-undiscovered material that my mother had not learned the secret of creating. Those parts of myself, incense doused and made whole, were all that did not belong to her.', 'My mother sensed this. She caught me on the stairs, twenty paces ahead of my bodyguard, and knew where I had been; she sniffed the incense that had settled on my hair.', '“What must people think of you?” She stood with her arms crossed and laughed. “What must Caesar think? The senators? They probably think you’re mad—or doing something political.”', '“Why?”', '“', ' goes to church.”', 'At last she forbade me to go. It wasn’t right for me to be seen there, she said—anyone who knew anything at all knew the story of her parthenogenesis; my existence routed all faith. Hadn’t she done herself—simply and without any trouble—what was prophesied? In any case, Caesar would think us no better than peasants.', 'She asked me why I wanted to go out into the dirt, into the soot, why I wanted to smell of sweat and fruit and onions, of the filth of the world.', '“It’ll get into the wiring,” she said, and began to scrub at my ankles with steel wool. “I’ll have to spend hours fixing it for you, and then where will we be?” Her laugh was long and high-pitched and hollow. “I don’t know why you insist on going out among them,” she said. “It’s only the unloved that need to go to those places, and you’re the best-loved girl in Rome.” She began tinkering with the panels on my back. “Don’t you think?”', 'I had grown used to nodding. The panels at the nape of my neck often triggered it a half step ahead of my own thoughts.', 'I went anyway, sneaking out at strange, orange-lit hours, lingering in the marketplace. Sometimes I bought prayer cards from the women who sold reliquaries on the church steps and took them home, just to annoy her.', '“You just don’t ', ',” my mother said when I returned.', 'My mother returned to her experiments. In my absence she filled her laboratory once more with objects both slithering and mechanical. She engineered griffins to guard the compound; she made pills that obviated the need for water, for grain, for meat.', 'She stopped sleeping. She locked herself in the laboratory, and at night I could hear the whirring of machinery: computer fans and bone saws. She did not speak to me, but her eyes were bloodshot, and even in repose her fingers scratched and picked at one another because she could not bear to sit still.', 'She built a robot with my face and tasked it with the domestic chores. She said nothing to me, but one day I came home to find my bed made and the dishes washed, and a girl with my old brown eyes staring at me across the kitchen table.', 'I pretended not to notice.', 'For Caesar she worked harder than ever. She worked on weapons, on bombs and spores. She no longer admired him. He too had failed her. He was weak in private—easily ruffled. She was too clever for him. She explained her formulas to him and he did not understand them; he only nodded—like an owl, she said—and sent her on her way.', 'Rome was not enough for her. She had come to hate it. She hated the obsequious waiters and the motorcycle oil that pooled up between the cobblestones. She hated the marketplace sounds: the squawking of chickens, the hawking of squid.', '“They don’t realize how much better I could do,” she said. She had stopped speaking to me; instead, she had taken up the habit of addressing the robot to whom she had given my eyes, inevitably in my overhearing. “You understand that, don’t you? I could give them something ', '.”', 'Nothing was worthwhile. She stood at our window and pressed her palms against the glass; at times she muttered curses at the passersby below. They did not understand her; nobody could understand her. Did they not know that the medicine in their drinking water, the fortifications in their joints, the serenity of their sleep—all this they owed to her?', 'I watched her from the doorway, tapping my feet upon the threshold, and relished her unhappiness. I was one of them, after all, with my still-beating heart, my left arm still fashioned of flesh. Like them I had the power to disappoint her.', 'One night she came into my room, woke me two hours before dawn to tell me she had discovered it—that through which all things would be purified. She had molted, melted, melded; she had alchemized and vaporized and at last she held in a ball no bigger than a thimble the secret to the beginning and the end, the proof of her greatness, the seal of her wisdom, the stamp of herself.', 'She would not let me sleep. She flung open the curtains; she stomped dust from the carpets; she dragged me into her laboratory and there, humming with joy, she revealed to me a small and spinning black sphere, the size of my rosary beads.', '“You see?” she said. “I’ve done it. I’ll show them, now.”', '“What does it do?”', 'Her laughter echoed from machine to machine. “Everything', '” It realigned asymmetries; it gathered viscera into geometrical shapes. It took cells and rearranged them in her image. It could cure congenital deformities, she said, from the inside out.', '“Is it safe?”', '“What do you take me for?”', 'She told Caesar she wanted to test it. She asked for five hundred men. The response came swiftly, on printed letterhead. It was too dangerous, he said. Perhaps she would be content with rats?', 'All night long she raged, throwing beakers and jars against the wall. The maid with my face scuttled behind her, sweeping up the mess.', '“You see how they’ve treated me?” she said. “They’ve made me a laughingstock—and it’s because of you! You think they don’t see you walking out alone, by yourself? You think they don’t wonder what kind of influence I am, letting you go out among the plebs? You think it’s not your fault?”', 'I had no answer for her.', 'She grabbed me by the shoulders, fixed her gaze on mine.', 'My eyes were made of electric sparks, and they gave nothing away.', 'The next morning my mother took me on our customary walk to the Capitoline, to see where her name had been inscribed upon the wall.', '“It’s a wonder they’ve got the balls to leave it up,” she said, “if this is how they’re going to treat us.” She took my hand. “Come. We’ll go to the Forum. We’ll have a picnic.”', 'We sat once more on the pillars; she spread cheese on bread—a rarity, now; she almost never ate food. Together we turned our faces to the sun. She pressed my cheek against her breast and ran her fingers through my hair. The crimson light of the dusk had settled upon her cheeks, and in that light she was beautiful. I leaned against her; her body was warm on mine, and I do not know if I have ever loved her more.', '“It’s only that I wanted to give you the world,” she whispered to me. “It’s only that I love you, and that nobody else really can.”', 'She began to hum—quietly at first, and then loudly enough for passersby to stop and stare—hum until every panel and every wire and every metal bolt within me began to vibrate with the beauty of it.', 'It was only when she stopped singing that I realized what she was about to do.', 'There was a flash, and then there was no more world.', '\\xa0', 'We can never go back. From time to time I don the necessary helmet and walk alone along the ramparts of the old city.', 'The men at the border press their foreheads to the floor. They retreat into their elevators and then I walk alone past the Colosseum, past the legless statues, the bones of stray cats. Now all seven hills are dust and shadows, and so alone I go to Pompey’s Theatre, to the stultifying emptiness of the Hippodrome where even the eagles are dead, and alone I venture into hollowed-out tramcars; the upturned Pantheon; the parks on the Janiculum, where the vines reach all the way to the river, which has not flowed for twenty years.', 'I walk until nightfall, and there is no sound but my footsteps, which is like no natural sound and which sickens me still. I go alone to what’s left of the basilica, to pray, and when my knees fall to the earth the clang echoes in my ears and it is the only sound left in the world.', 'Sometimes, briefly, I forget, and I think that I am home.', 'There is a caesura between all that was and all that is, between the city I loved and the city that I know now, between my mother’s city and my own.', 'My left arm is gone now; it was the only part of me that could not withstand the blast. I screamed from the gurney for them to let it be: it was withered and misshapen; it was all that was left of her. But in those days nobody knew what was happening, or how long the effects would last, and there was a fear the spores might spread. They cut off the arm and burned it; two hours later they placed Rome under quarantine.', 'Caesar died instantly. In the wild and wrecked months that followed, in those frantic and fevered weeks of dead burying and barricading ourselves indoors, we went on without him. Those of us who survived were those with false arms, false legs, false eyes, bearing, all of us, my mother’s seal.', 'If the others suspected what she had done, we never spoke of it. To condemn her was to condemn her works; we could not afford to lose her genius now.', 'I was her keeper, in the end. I was the one with keys to her laboratory; I was the one who knew what she had built, who knew how it all worked. I was the one who taught the others how to secure buildings, far from the seven hills, how to keep the spores out.', 'I was the one without flesh, and so I was the one who could walk in the old city, unharmed. They sent me to count the dead, to take names and photographs, to remember them. I was the one who reported to them that my mother had died with the rest. I lied.', 'Her face is withered; her skin is green. She rasps when she speaks, and it is only because I know her so well that I am able to understand her. She lives on the Capitoline, in an empty tramcar, waited upon by the sightless servant who bears my face. She inhales poisoned air and engineers her own temporary remedies. I bring her pills, in as many different flavors as I can invent, and she insists that I am lying to her.', '“That’s not how it happened at all,” she says. “There was nothing wrong with it. I checked it—twenty times. I made no mistakes.” Her story changes. Sometimes she insists that it was Caesar’s conspiracy, that he altered the formula behind her back, that he was jealous of her power. Sometimes she insists that I must have tampered with it in the laboratory, that I must have turned a dial too far in the wrong direction and forgotten about it, and so this is why the world has been destroyed. Sometimes, the worst times, she tells me that we are better off now, that this is only a temporary setback, a necessary ellipsis between the world in which I was born and the world she knows that I deserve.', 'She asks me about the laboratory, about my research. Sometimes, when I reach an impasse in my experiments, she is the one who tells me what to do next. She slips me formulas, chiseled into slate, and reminds me to polish her inscription at the gates. I carry the weight of her on my back when I go.', '“You’re alive,” she says. “And that’s what matters. You’re alive, and they know us now. By our works, they will know us, and you will lead them into tomorrow.”', 'They made me Caesar. I never told her. It was the only way I could think of to punish her.', 'Last night I told the Senate that I have found the cure, that I have made perfect my mother’s research. I told them I have engineered a device that will destroy all the spores and purify the air once more.', 'There is only one problem, I said. We will have to destroy it first. We can’t risk a cell, a speck, a single gangrenous dot remaining. We will atomize the ruins, the colonnades, the vines; we will level the seven hills, and then—when everything is ash—we can rebuild.', 'They murmured “hail,” and licensed me to do as I see fit.', 'Tomorrow, I will put my seal on the decree, and then men in gas masks will tear down the ramparts of my childhood places; tomorrow I will erase my mother’s footprints and the sound of her voice from the face of the earth, and in the smoke of the earth I will bury her. I will walk out into the world she has left for me, and then with two sticks and a match I will build her up again.', '\\xa0', '“The Destroyer” copyright © 2016 by Tara Isabella Burton', 'Art copyright © 2016 by Ashley Mackenzie']}\n"
